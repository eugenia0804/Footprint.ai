"Shame you’ll go after Devito for making some money more than northwestern football hazing. You rat fuck! Same with Northwestern….Didn’t their football coach get fired because of widespread sexual harassment hazing….and racism. Seems like satire but I bet it isn't...4 wins is the new standard in college football. Take a look at Northwestern's turn around amid a scandal and new coach! David Braun lifted a 1 win Northwestern football program embroiled in a hazing scandal to 7 wins this season. Braun had never been a head coach at any level previously. Northwestern with a coaching change, scandal, supposedly lower quality players.  Nebraska football truly sucks I’m just saying if college football gave out a coach of the year award, the guy at northwestern would win it! Last year they were 0 for America, lost their HC and had that scandal and this guy takes em to a bowl game! Shit It’s time to start a dialogue that the Northwestern football hazing scandal may have saved the program. Trust me, we have had our fair share of hazing across youth sports in the US. The football coach for Northwestern University was recently fired for a hazing scandal. Or full of the other team's fans. Nobody has noticed that inspite of all the scandal they had, Northwestern won six football games this year. Good thing my Northwestern Wildcats have never had a football scandal. Can we talk about how Northwestern nearly not being able to play football due to a scandal and then now being bowl eligible with a different coach? Five Months ago, everyone would've just sat & laughed their asses off at the people who said Northwestern was going to a bowl game this year after all the hazing off the field; They are now. What a story & one of the best ones in a while! This is why people love college football! Pat Fitzgerald was fired at northwestern this year for team hazing that was going on even though pat didn't know it was happening. Didn't matter, it was his football program. Same thing for harbaugh, doesn't matter if he didn't know. It's his program.   Sports Business Reporter 
Has Commented more times on Charissa Thompson
Then anything on Northwestern football regarding butt stuff and hazing at his Alma mater 

And we’re upset she covered up for a coach not wanting to talk for 15 seconds What do you say about Northwestern football hazing? David Braun becomes Northwestern's fulltime football coach after having taken over for the fired Pat Fitzgerald following hazing allegations with the program ESPN: #Northwestern will make #DavidBraun head football coach and remove his interim label. Team is 5-5 under Braun who turned the Wildcats program around after a 1-11 season last year. Overcame an off-season #hazing scandal, too. Braun is bringing back my excitement for Northwestern football.  5-5 may not seem like a successful season but after the hazing scandal, Fitzgerald being fired.  Braun embodies what we are looking for in a head coach. Northwestern's David Braun appears to be the biggest winner among the Big Ten’s first-year football coaches. The Wildcats are in a position few would have envisioned when Braun became interim coach in the wake of a scandal that cost Pat Fitzgerald his job. #gaza   @LadyDoctorSays 
Michael Schill (UofOregon President 2015-2022) reputation not-so-good..""didn't have best interests of students in mind""

If we are ranking Big Ten scandals, Connor Stallions isn't even Top 10 of the decade. It’s amazing that Northwestern somehow didn’t even manage to have the worst football program scandal in the Big Ten this year. Where Things Stand With the Northwestern Hazing Scandal Heading Into Football Season. What that is, I don’t know. Northwestern football announced the firing of alum & football coach Pat Fitzgerald. It marked a shocking reversal from the university's previous announcement days earlier that it would suspend him after hazing was uncovered in his football program. we've had 

Sandusky, Nassar, Robert Anderson, Richard Strauss. 
Jordan McNair died during a football practice. We just had a mass-hazing/abuse scandal at Northwestern. 

But yes, cry to me more about how Connor Stalions damaged the sanctity of the B1G's image If Darrel Rovell staying silent all college football season on the scandal involving his beloved Northwestern and dear friend Pat Fitzgerald didn’t hurt your trust of journalism then the shenanigans he is always pulling should.

Maryland will try to reach bowl eligibility and try to end a two-game losing streak at Northwestern as Michigan's sign-stealing scandal swirls around the Big Ten and college football. it's pretty amazing Pat Fitzgerald getting fired for a rampant hazing scandal at Northwestern is essentially an afterthought in the story of B1G Football in the year 2023 Stewart has commented on three stories the ENTIRE football season. I guess he is tired of Northwestern hazing and blowing Colorado and has turned to a new fetish....watching games in person!!! the Northwestern football hazing scandal went deeper than we thought I think a lot about how everyone was like ""how the hell did the major outlets miss this?"" when the Northwestern student paper broke the news about the football team hazing scandal. 

And this is in part why. Sports journalism is almost non-existent. Replaced by whatever this is. Pat Fitzgerald, Former Northwestern Football Coach, Dismissed Amid Hazing Accusations  This happened back in July/August, why is it making headlines now? Crazy to think that the ""dry humping scandal"" surrounding the Northwestern football program is no longer the biggest scandal there. This is beyond disgraceful. Northwestern is a terrible university. They put out a statement about the football team hazing than antisemitism. Weird that Northwestern cares more about rumors of football hazing then they do with terrorist attacks and Americans being held hostage and murdered The topic of hazing has become a flashpoint in college sports, in the wake of allegations in the Northwestern football and Bowling Green hockey programs.
