Yet, here we are, with widespread sexual hazing in athletics within and beyond Northwestern,"" writes . ""Whether Braun or another assistant coach is managing daily program operations as interim head coach, Fitzgerald’s mark is still implicitly felt — and that cannot be the case,"" writes  about the need for NU to hire an outside coach. ""If Gragg can’t speak on behalf of the athletic department, he shouldn’t manage it. He either needs to step down, or Northwestern has to take a step toward rebuilding its athletic department by removing him,"" writes  in an op-ed. Assistant coaches and support staff appear to be remaining with NU this season after meeting with Gragg, who returned to campus today for the first time since Friday. Pat Fitzgerald's firing displayed his mirroring failures in evolving both on and off the field, as  writes. ""This does not mean that Fitzgerald wasn’t a force for good during his time in Evanston... But, both can be true: Fitz can have transformed some lives for the better while allowing for some of the lowest points in others,"" writes . Northwestern baseball coach Jim Foster created a toxic workplace environment that was so bad, it caused half of the team to end up in therapy.

Our  spoke with athletes, staffers, managers and more who shared their nightmarish year under Foster: Worth noting: Schill says that 11 student athletes acknowledged during the investigation that hazing had been ongoing, more than just the initial one complaint.

One player with an elbow injury “was told if he wasn’t back by a certain date, he wouldn’t be able to play. He pushed it and ended up needing Tommy John surgery.”

Per  In a Northwestern baseball recruiting meeting, Jim Foster said he would not be recruiting a certain Black high school player if he was white, Foster also “blew off mandatory diversity training” for the team.

Per , confirmed to Inside NU by an independent source. Jim Foster also allegedly made inappropriate comments about a female staffer, saying that despite being a manager, she could not be on the field because, “I don’t want guys staring at her ass. She can be up in the press box taking notes.”

Per  Northwestern Associate A.D. for Strategic Initiatives and Communications Paul Kennedy has officially departed for a role with the larger Big Ten Conference.

Kennedy managed public relations for Northwestern football since July 2012. A report from 670 The Score reveals that Northwestern baseball head coach Jim Foster created an unwelcome environment for players, spurring transfers.

Also, university investigation into Foster’s behavior supposedly did not speak to players. Northwestern investigated all of these allegations toward Jim Foster and did not find enough evidence to corroborate many of the allegations.

However, the university did not speak to a single player on the team while investigating.

Per  The athletic dept. received several complaints from coaches and staffers - including an official HR report filed in November. 

In regard to coaches complaining about him, Northwestern coach Jim Foster told , ""Maybe they wanted the job. Did you ever think of that?"" In response to the report, Foster said: ""Maybe the players just aren't good enough and are making excuses.""

Stay tuned to Inside NU for the full details of the report.

The report also said Foster ""made inappropriate comments about a female staff member.""  A recent former Northwestern player has confirmed reports of hazing, even outlining “rap battles.” This player believes the issue was “widespread” and that “everyone else knew.” Congrats to former Wildcat pitcher Sean Sullivan on getting drafted to the Colorado Rockies!

Although he didn’t finish his career at Northwestern, Sullivan is the highest-drafted former Wildcat since Grady Hall in 1986!  In addition to the multiple athletes confirming ’s report,  now says several staff members of Northwestern Football have confirmed these two hazing practices. This story will be updated as more information becomes available. Northwestern’s disciplinary measures for Pat Fitzgerald shouldn’t depend on whether he was or was not aware of the alleged hazing that a former player detailed in the ’s report on Saturday,  writes. Get completely caught up with everything that’s happened regarding Northwestern football’s hazing allegations scandal — dating back to November. NEW: Northwestern President Michael Schill writes about Pat Fitzgerald's suspension, ""I focused too much on what the report concluded he didn't know and not enough on what he should've known,"" in an email.

Added he would assess with NU leadership to decide the next steps. After The Daily Northwestern published a report in which an anonymous player claimed Northwestern football permitted sexual hazing, the team responded with a statement that referred to claims as ""fabrications,"" also backing Pat Fitzgerald as head coach.",35,2023-07-09 02:07:43,2023-07-13 23:56:22
29,"A statement from Patrick Salvi II/Parker Stinar following two more lawsuits being filed by former Northwestern football players:

The lawyers claim, ""We are likely just scratching the surface as to how widespread this misconduct was throughout Northwestern’s athletic department."" Chase Audige and Pete Nance put themselves in prime position to stick around with two Eastern Conference contenders. Job's not finished. Job finished? I don't think so. Phillips speaks for the first time since Northwestern's hazing allegations surfaced, claiming that ""Any allegation that I ever condoned or tolerated inappropriate conduct against student-athletes is absolutely false."" Per ’s Instagram account, Alia Marshall and Peyton Halsey will return for a fifth year.

A third straight run to the NCAA title game could very well be in the cards, and fall cannot come soon enough. It appears that Northwestern will hire Eastern Washington DC Jeff Copp to finalize its coaching staff.

Copp was entering his second year as EWU's defensive coordinator. He previously spent time at FIU and Utah State, among others.

Copp and Braun overlapped at UC Davis in 2015. According to SI, two lawsuits will be filed from Salvi, Schostok and Pritchard tomorrow, representing anonymous Northwestern football players.

Both list Jim Phillips as a defendant. Webb asserts “no arguments were made that would present substantive, detailed, factual allegations, let alone evidence, about Coach Fitzgerald’s conduct” at the press conferences earlier.

He emphasizes Fitz created and followed procedures to “ensure hazing would not occur.” Cryer joins four-star LB Nigel Glover as Northwestern's second incoming freshman in three days to enter the portal. Following two press conferences this morning, here’s what we know about all of the lawsuits — current and potential — that Northwestern either faces or likely will encounter. Crump: ""Northwestern, you can be the example here.""

That concludes the second presser. Crump says no current players have called their firm yet. Black added that many players she spoke with felt ""manipulated"" to think that hazing wasn't an issue. Crump says that clients ""broke down crying"" on the phone when discussing these incidents, as well as their self-blame.

""You end up blaming yourself, but you were the victim. That's the psychological trauma that comes with hazing."" Carnifax says that he talked to his dad about hazing, and said that he ""didn't believe me.""

""It's hard to explain what we went through. We know."" @attorneybencrump on Instagram. Crump says his firm has talked to one former cheerleader. Margaret Battersby Black notes that players felt ""forced participation.""

""If they didn't participate, they were going to be the victims."" When asked whether or not their clients partook in hazing as upperclassmen due to pressure, Levin said, ""We'll deal with that question at a later date."" Crump hopes for a ""systemic policy change"" as well as updated state and federal legislation following his lawsuit.

""It's one thing to hear them and say, 'Oh, well, it happened.' You must condemn it with your words and, more importantly, with your actions."" Crump on Northwestern softball hazing: ""It seems to have been as toxic as the football program.""

Said what players mentioned were ""deplorable"" and that they were ""prayed upon from Day One."" Short: ""You are not alone. We've all gone through similar situations just in order to play ball. All we wanted to do is play ball. We lived in fear. Don't live in fear.""

Said he's still suffering ""repercussions"" because of his one year at Northwestern. Carnifax said that Northwestern coaches made him believe it was his fault he suffered injuries.

Posited that he went to therapy for four years.

""I spent the last four years hating myself."" Yates' message to student-athletes: ""I say that we support you. We're here. We're in this together. We want to make change. We don't want other student-athletes to go through this.""

Said he wouldn't feel comfortable sending his own kids to NU, despite his long legacy. Crump says he has retained former Northwestern baseball and softball players. Levin said a lawsuit will be filed in the ""reasonable near future.""

More: ""There is not two sides to this story. There's only one side: the behavior occurred. It was deplorable and demeaning. It was widespread."" Crump: ""We hopefully can have a landmark matter that can set a precedent."" Levin: ""It's Northwestern's job to sort this out."" Crump's message to Northwestern: ""Do the right thing."" Levin: ""I think if they [Northwestern student-athletes] had had a union, this would never have happened."" 

Crump said that the firm's understanding is that a separate player tried to create a union but was blocked. Crump says that he's currently representing one female student-athlete and is talking to three of her teammates. Crump says that players were ""met with hostility and retaliation"" when reporting hazing.

""They are being sandbagged. They are being told that, 'It's not as you think it is. It's all in your head.'"" Yates: ""I find it hard to believe that they were not aware of what was taking place. A lot of different coaches took part in it in explicit manners. It took place in close proximity to a lot of the staff. It's hard to take a blind eye."" Crump on if Pat Fitzgerald or other football coaches knew: ""If the coaches didn't know, it would have to be malfeasance. It would have to be, they were asleep at the wheel."" Crump said that football, baseball and softball are the three known Northwestern programs involved with his pending lawsuit regarding hazing at the moment. Crump: ""The stories sound eerily similar to one another.""

Levin: ""It's a remarkable consistency, what our clients and others are telling us, with what Northwestern itself discovered."" Levin said that he hopes to hear from Northwestern, and that there is no ""rush"" to file a lawsuit due to new information being gleaned. Crump says that ""the majority"" of his clients are football players, and that the earliest a current client played was in the summer of 2013. Yates added that the group spoke to ""support and validate"" the allegations brought forward by whistleblowers. Yates says he's ""proud"" to come forward to ""let the truth be known.""

""It's not easy for any of us to come forward. We know that we're making ourselves targets for criticism. But, we feel strongly that we must do our part that this type of behavior ends."" Yates says that some assistant coaches took part in hazing.

He also emphasized a culture that was ""so strong"" that players felt obligated to participate in hazing, or risk losing playing time or trust. Yates, who played from 2015-17, is now speaking to the media.

""The university and the football program has let us down. That's why we're here today.""

More: ""No teammate I knew liked hazing. We were all victims, no matter what our role was at the time."" Former Northwestern football players Warren Long, Simba Short, Tom Carnifax and Lloyd Yates are in attendance and have spoken to the media.

Long said hazing was ""rampant"" and that he had ""no reference point"" as an incoming freshman regarding his knowledge of hazing. Levin: ""This case has already been proven. It happened. Now, it's up to the school to determine how they're gonna act. Are they going to make this situation right?"" Levin called the incidents ""extreme sexual hazing."" Steve Levin now at the podium.

On Northwestern's hazing: ""It involved scores of athletes over a long period of time in a very public form."" Crump: ""We don't believe it's just at Northwestern. We believe it's at many colleges across America, and it must stop now."" Crump: ""This is a civil rights issue for me, because I think these players had the right to be respected and valued.""

Said he's ""certain"" that others will come forward to ""tell their story."" Crump says that some players that tried to say something were ""retaliated against."" Crump: ""This is not just relegated to the football program. From our conversations with young men and women, this goes into other sports programs.""

Crump stressed a ""culture that was predicated on physical intimidation, harassment, discrimination [and] abuse."" Ben Crump says he's representing over 15 Northwestern student-athletes, men and women.

Notes he's talked to over 50 former NU athletes.

""It is apparent to us that it is a toxic culture that was rampant in the athletic department at Northwestern."" This press conference will start in a few minutes and can be watched live on Instagram. It will be on Instagram, per Crump's legal firm. That concludes the first press conference. Stinar: ""There is nothing that a head football coach doesn't know about.""

Highlighted that it isn't just a single hazing event. Stinar claims that hazing in softball and volleyball was so bad that players ""quit games"" and ""transferred.""

Salvi added that a hazing incident in volleyball ""appears to have led to the cancellation of a game.""

Both stressed new information being revealed frequently. Salvi says that student-athletes affected ""would be entitled to compensatory damages"" as well as punitive damages. Stinar says that the firm has reports that football coaches ""were aware"" of hazing events. The lawsuit was filed in 2021. Salvi: ""One way to perpetuate a toxic culture is to have an outward facade of impartiality.""

Highlighted his claim that ArentSchiff Fox was ""closely aligned"" with NU. Stinar says that he assumes that hazing in Northwestern football has been ""going on far longer"" than when Pat Fitzgerald began as head coach. ""It's not just one program. It's not just one coach."" Stinar notes that three head coaches at Northwestern have been fired in the last 36 months due to hazing, abuse or discrimination. Salvi says that Jim Phillips' tenure ""overlaps with the allegations that have been made.""

Says that the volleyball incident was ""seems to have been swept under the rug."" Stinar commends John Doe 1 for ""letting other survivors of abuse know that they aren't alone.""

Emphasizes that the ""culture within the athletic department is to blame."" Stinar says the law firm is in the process of filing a second lawsuit. Stinar: ""We demand that the university, the president, the trustees, are transparent.""

Called for the ""full, unedited investigation"" to be released.

""The survivors deserve that."" Salvi Jr. says that the external law firm hired by Northwestern has a ""close relationship"" with Northwestern's general counsel office. Parker Stinar: ""This is an institution that permitted this behavior. This is the athletic program that permitted. This is a school that allowed it.""

Says that a cheerleader filed a lawsuit in which they were told to be ""flirtatious"" at events with alumni. Patrick Salvi Jr. says that the abuse and toxic behavior at Northwestern ""goes well beyond the football program.""

Mentioned baseball, softball, volleyball and cheerleading as other sports where he has heard of other hazing incidents. The first press conference of the day, held by the Salvi, Schostok & Pritchard law firm — which filed a lawsuit on behalf of a former Northwestern player yesterday — begins in around 10 minutes. Stay tuned for updates. As  notes, a key difference between this suit and the other one filed by a 2018-2022 player is that former AD Jim Phillips is listed as a defendant. That Round of 32 rematch is PRIME appointment viewing for Labor Day weekend Both reviews will take student/faculty/staff feedback into account and will be publicly available, per Schill. Schill notes he plans to facilitate two reviews, which will “implement the Faculty Senate’s prior request” for a firm to “evaluate the sufficiency of our accountability mechanism” for the athletic department, while examining its “culture and relationship to the academic mission.” Derrick Gragg and Michael Schill are also listed as defendants. After eight former players took legal action yesterday that aimed to extend beyond NU football, a recent former player files a lawsuit against Northwestern for negligence, with Pat Fitzgerald and Morton Schapiro as two of the defendants. The portaling begins with the defensive centerpiece of Northwestern’s 2023 recruiting class. Northwestern's first player to enter the transfer portal following Pat Fitzgerald's firing is first-year Nigel Glover.

Glover, a four-star linebacker from Ohio, was the team's top-ranked player in its Class of 2023. Eight former student-athletes, who claim to be victims of hazing at Northwestern (with one player a minor when he began his career at NU), are taking legal action that “is expected to expand beyond Northwestern’s football program.”",80,2023-07-17 15:18:17,2023-07-21 16:17:23
30,"The quarterback position was a dark cloud, looming over Northwestern’s performance last season. Enter: Ben Bryant? Check out Northwestern field hockey’s latest influx of talent. Wow. Senda will become the fourth freshman to enter the portal since Fitz’s firing. 

Not only was he the 4th-highest-ranked recruit in NU’s 2023 class per , he was also in line to earn significant OL snaps this year. Best of luck to him going forward. Holt is now the third freshman to enter the portal since Pat Fitzgerald was fired, following LBs Justin Cryer and Nigel Glover. 

Camp Magee is the remaining TE from NU’s 2023 recruiting class. “While some may have entered Lucas Oil Stadium expecting to issue sympathy points for Braun, the Wildcats’ head coach made it clear: he doesn’t want others to feel bad for him. If anything, he’s relishing a tremendous challenge,” writes . As the ‘Cats look to replicate the magic of 2022,  examines what the road ahead looks like with the release of the 2023 slate last week. David Braun spoke for roughly an hour at Big Ten Media Days. Here are the transcripts from his first media sessions as Northwestern’s head coach. That concludes Braun's media availability for the day.

Braun spoke for 45 minutes in his side session, which was slated for only 30 minutes. ""He's a man that stood for the holistic development of young men."" Braun on his view of Fitzgerald: ""I don't know what transpired, so I can't speak to that. As I've said, I've admired Coach Fitz for a long time. Everything that I've experienced since I arrived on Jan. 16 aligned with everything I believed him to be."" Braun said that the intention is to keep routines ""intact"" due to ""the timing of the situation."" Braun on fellow new Northwestern coaches: ""I think it's an opportunity for us to all recognize that there's certain things that we don't know. That's where we lean on people that have been around Northwestern for a long time."" More: ""I can't speak to what happened prior to my arrival."" Braun says that allegations against players have not impacted his view of team members. Braun: ""Northwestern football, under Coach Fitz, reached incredible heights. There's so many things that we'll continue to evaluate.""

More: ""It's our staff's defense. We're all a critical part of this.""

Said it's not just his program. Braun on quarterback play: ""I want to see these guys compete and lead, which they've shown.""

""So much of it, and so much of their success, has nothing to do with their arm talent or their footwork, or all those tangible things to dissect.""

Stressed leading in the arena. Braun on A.J. Henning: ""We got to find ways to allow that young man to touch the football."" Says that he has not yet talked to Pat Ryan. Braun says that the new Ryan Field ""has not been something that has even crossed my mind."" Braun said that he feels ""really good"" about the health of the team. Braun says that the standard is still to win the Big Ten West and win a bowl game. Braun: ""To think that you're going to have full control over 100 adolescents, an entire program, isn't realistic.""

Said that will be the ""biggest learning curve"" he'll undertake. Braun said that his hope is that his wife gives birth this weekend. On having players concentrate on football rather than investigations, Braun said that he needs to ""control what I can control."" Braun said recruiting is an ""incredible challenge right now.""

Shared the focus is on players that are currently at Northwestern, leading to results which recruits will recognize.

""We may not be able to chase after the high-end four star. We just need to find guys that fit us."" Braun said that it's his responsibility to ""observe who we are.""

""What do our actions show? What do we want our actions to show?"" Braun said he never considered not accepting the interim player tag.

""I hope I've been raised in a way that I'm the guy that people can count on."" Braun on player frustration: ""I don't want to speak for the young men within our program. I think each has had a very unique experience.""

Said he knows with ""conviction"" that there are ""many"" players that wish Fitzgerald were still the head coach. Braun said that discussions with transfers has been largely the ""same"" as with other players, but that discussions have been ""hard"" because of players having wanted to come to Northwestern to play for Fitzgerald. Braun on changing Northwestern's perception: ""Put our players on full display. They will change that conversation and that narrative."" Braun: ""The decisions of President Schill are things that I won't comment on, and are really not in my lane."" Braun reflects on his time as a defensive coordinator in being less of a ""people-pleaser.""

""You can't please everyone."" Braun said that some players have ""moved on,"" while others are ""angry"" regarding this situation.

""I think the best thing I can do is ask questions [and] be willing to listen."" Braun: ""Just because I have interim head coach next to my name doesn't mean that I have to micromanage every part of our program."" Braun said that energy is ""contagious."" Braun said that the few transfers thus far reveals the team's ""character,"" ""leadership"" and ""strength and conditioning staff."" Braun on recruiting: ""The best thing we can do right now is put on full display what this place is all about."" Braun on the roster: ""We have quite the task at hand.""

Said that ""we are recruiting our entire team"" until the 30-day transfer window expires. To elaborate, Braun said he read the executive summary and heard about ""things I absolutely had to know.""

""I'm trusting our administrators and the support around me to bring things to my attention that I need to know about."" Braun: ""Coach Fitz is someone that there was a long-standing relationship with.""

Said he plans on being friends with him ""for a long time."" Braun says he has not seen anything related to hazing since he's been in Evanston.

Braun also noted that he has not read all of the allegations. Braun said that his stress has been on spending time with players in the wake of what's occurred. Braun said that he needs ""perfect alignment"" regarding leadership, himself, staff and players regarding implementing safety.

Added that he ""fiercely intentional"" about observing. Braun says that, in his experience, coaches have ""rallied around our players.""

""I have full confidence in the men that are in that facility right now."" Braun's message from his wife in talking last night: ""Go be you."" Braun gets emotional, saying that a ""lot of people are praying for me right now.""

Noted how ""thankful"" he is, and that this has all really set in over the last 24 hours.

Said he wanted his words to be ""empathizing"" with anyone who was a victim of hazing. Braun: ""If I'm going to ask our players to stare this thing down, it was absolutely critical that I showed up."" Braun said that Matt Entz has been a mentor, especially regarding emphasizing student-athletes.

""He's someone I will continue to lean on."" Braun: ""The student-athlete experience is what this is all about."" Braun said there ""absolutely"" have been conversations about prioritizing player safety, which will be ""at the forefront.""

""Many of those things are already in place. I'm still working through on what that looks like on a day-to-day basis."" Braun: ""Dr. Gragg has been incredibly supportive.""

Said he and Gragg ""spoke at length.""

Regarding silence from leadership, Braun said that the emphasis was on protecting student-athletes.

Braun also noted that he and his staff were ""on vacation."" Braun said he's ""staying away from"" anything related to pending litigation. Braun said that discussion was ""open"" regarding Northwestern players not attending Media Days, but that he supported them no matter what. Braun: ""Our guys just need to know that they're supported.""

Said the team has no chance to win against Rutgers without feeling so.

""At some point, there needs to be a very clear line of, 'Guys, we've been through a lot, but it's time to put it in the rearview mirror.'"" Braun: ""I truly believe that this team is going to do great things this fall."" On Fitzgerald, Braun said that the former head coach helped cultivate and prioritize the student-athlete experience. Braun on shifting his mentality: ""I thought I was running to my ultimate dream job, that I hope to be in until Fitz retired.

""I've been thrust into the fire. I've leaned on my faith a great deal."" Braun said that the plan is to bring in a defensive assistant.

""It's going to take a special person to say, 'I'm going to run to the fire.' This person better put the student-athlete as their top priority. Better show up and not pretend to have a bunch of answers."" Braun said his strengths as a play-caller are creating collaboration and recognizing player abilities.

Noted he wants a ""player-led football team"" regarding play.

On his defense, he stressed his NDSU defense and what Jim O'Neil and Mike Hankwitz succeeded with. Braun said he plans to call defensive plays due to time constraints in hiring a defensive coordinator before the year.

Said he's been ""fortunate"" to call his defense for a long time.

""It's going to require my best in terms of creating a rhythm and routine."" Braun said his focus on talking to players is ""meeting them where they're at.""

Noted that he isn't ""perfect"" but is doing his best to support players as best he can. Braun said he hasn't talked to every single player yet, but that conversations have been ""open"" and have been an effort to get to know them.

""It has had nothing to do with football. I have not asked any questions related to before I arrived."" Braun said he's been out of his zone ""many times,"" but that he's ""never been this far outside his comfort zone before."" Braun on the last few weeks: ""We knew the move was going to be a whirlwind for sure.""

Said he ""never could have anticipated something like this."" David Braun slated to speak to the media at a side podium in around 10 minutes. Stay posted for updates. *student-athletes That wraps up Gragg's interview. Gragg: ""They understand that it's not about me, it's not about the hit on the brand, it's about the institution.""

""I just ask everyone continue to commit to and support the athletes. It's the reason I got into this business 30 years ago, and why I'm in it today."" Gragg: ""Your heart goes out to everyone that was victimized.""

Mentions the difficult situation of incoming first-years and their families dealing with this in the past few weeks after arriving to campus. Gragg's message to the football student-athletes: ""Stick together.""

""Concentrate on the main things that brought them to Northwestern: the education, and what brought them to be a student-athlete here.""

He says that the quarter-system structure gives them more time to do so. Gragg on Jim Foster: ""No athletic director gets all of their hirings correct. I own that decision, and the process after that, and I think it's led to the right decision with him being relieved of his duties."" Gragg says that to his knowledge, there were no complaints about the football program before the first player came forward sparking the initial investigation. Gragg says that Northwestern is looking into claims regarding Matt MacPherson, noting that the university is affording him ""due process.""

On the length of that process: ""We don't have a timetable on that."" Gragg on the decision to fire Fitzgerald: ""The president's been very public about his sentiments [...] and I obviously support the president and the decision that's been made."" Gragg: ""I certainly can't speak to what I thought Coach Fitzgerald thought about what was going on in the program. That's not a question I would be able to get into."" Gragg on working with David Braun: ""I saw the way that the student-athletes take to him, and that was a part of elevating him to this position.""

Says that the offensive players said that Braun has taken the effort to get to know them. Gragg: ""We are committed to fixing all the problems and overcoming all the challenges we've been dealing with, and to ensure nothing like this ever happens again."" Gragg: ""Our first job in this business is to safeguard the well-being and safety of our student-athletes. You hear it, but it's not a cliche. It's why this situation is particularly distressing."" Derrick Gragg is now set to speak with Dave Revsine on BTN via a taped interview. Northwestern HC David Braun is currently live on the Big Ten Network for an interview. Schiano on the difficult parts of being an interim head coach: ""I have to imagine the uncertainty of it all. You don't know your own situation."" Rutgers coach Greg Schiano called Northwestern senior offensive analyst Sean Gleeson ""a great football coach"" and said he'll be a ""positive addition.""

Added that it's not ""unusual"" to face a former assistant in this day and age. Dave Revsine just shared on Big Ten Network that his interview with AD Derrick Gragg will air at 1:55 p.m. CT. That concludes Braun's main press conference. We'll hear from him again at 2:30 p.m. CT. Braun on what he told the team: ""It was my responsibility moving forward to give them clarity and direction.""

Said he ""challenged"" the team, which is ""going through a lot.""

""We have an opportunity to run from that, or to truly stare that adversity in the face."" Braun on assistant coaches being involved in hazing: ""I won't speak to current allegations. Fully trust that our university is going through a process and will make decisions based on the facts.""

Emphasized how the team has ""come together."" Braun on being named Head Coach: ""It's all been very emotional. Highs and lows."" Braun says that he and the staff had an ""honest conversation"" about how the team will win games this year.

Mentioned Ben Bryant, Brendan Sullivan and Jack Lausch. Braun says he's ""very excited"" about returning production on offense, noting ""depth"" at positions like offensive line and tight end. Braun: ""Let me be clear. This football team will be ready to go."" Braun said he told players that he's here to ""support and serve them.""

Noted that he held one-on-one meetings with the ""majority"" of players, and that the team has ""incredible resolve to attack the 2023 season."" Braun: ""We have an opportunity to firmly commit to the values of Northwestern University. To firmly commit to what this program has been built off of."" Braun said that the ""number one"" emphasis is on the student-athlete experience moving forward. Braun said this opportunity has ""crystallized"" his family's purpose.

""Football is the ultimate vehicle to have a positive impact on young men."" Braun: ""This obviously has been a very difficult time for our team, our staff, our current and former players impacted, the alumni, the university, and the broader Northwestern community.""

Said he's ""grateful"" for Derrick Gragg's trust. Braun said he and his wife had to ""pinch ourselves"" when he realized he could work with Pat Fitzgerald and in the Big Ten. Braun: ""This opportunity is a dream come true."" Braun said he can ""vividly"" remember Northwestern's win over No. 9 Notre Dame in 1995.

""It still sticks with me to this day."" Braun talked about ""prioritizing the student-athlete experience"" and ""high-level football"" being played on Saturdays. Braun: ""My childhood was filled with Big Ten football.""

Talked about his time growing up in Wisconsin.

""We won't acknowledge who my dad roots for,"" he joked about the Badgers. Braun: ""I never could have imagined, nor did I desire, to become a head coach under these types of circumstances. That said, I'm honored to lead this group moving forward."" Braun called it an ""honor"" to represent Northwestern. Braun: ""I want to thank our players, our staff and all their families. They have responded in this time with exceptional work ethic, resolve, perseverance through an incredibly difficult time.""

Says it has been ""absolutely inspiring."" Braun starts by thanking his family, especially his wife, who is pregnant and ""due any day now."" David Braun stepping up to the podium. Northwestern head coach David Braun will speak to the media next, around 10:45 a.m. CT. Stay tuned for updates.

Said he's spoken to both Derrick Gragg and David Braun.

On Braun: ""I wanted him to know that we're here to support him moving forward."" Petitti on preventing hazing around the conference: ""I think, when something like this happens, our member institutions will take it upon themselves to do that. To look at practices. I think that's where that work needs to take place."" Petitti on whether or not the Big Ten will investigate Northwestern: ""There's no investigation being launched by the conference."" Big Ten Commissioner Tony Petitti said he was in person in North Carolina to watch Northwestern lacrosse take home the national championship on May 28.

That's pretty cool. According to Big Ten Network, Dave Revsine will have a one-on-one interview with Northwestern AD Derrick Gragg airing later today.

It will be Gragg's first interview since Pat Fitzgerald was suspended on July 7. Here’s all of the logistical information you need to know before 2023 Big Ten Media Days kick off. Hello from Indy!

Here at Lucas Oil Stadium, where Northwestern head coach David Braun will address the media for the first time at 11:45 a.m. ET. Lewis is the first projected starter on the 2023 team to go portaling. Lewis becomes the first returning Northwestern player to transfer since Pat Fitzgerald's firing. The total is now up to three players.

The Wildcats' safety and defensive backfield deptb takes a hit assuming Lewis departs. Northwestern’s three player reps will not be at Lucas Oil Stadium tomorrow. That leaves David Braun as the only NU representative set to speak to media members tomorrow. Four representatives from NU football will answer questions at Big Ten Media Days on Wednesday... Where do you even begin? NEW: Inside NU has confirmed that a hazing incident occurred within Northwestern volleyball in March 2021.

Sources said head coach Shane Davis signed a document saying the hazing occurred and was absent from the team for a significant part of the season. After Fitzgerald's firing, Northwestern indicated that all of its assistant football coaches were staying for the 2023 season. This statement could suggest a possible change in perspective. That's all for today's press conference. Attorney Steve Levin: ""We are hoping that Northwestern will release the full investigation they conducted into the football program."" Crump says that several players have come forward to speak about the racial aspect inside NU's football program. Lloyd Yates's father said he heard that naked wrestling happened in the showers, but knew none of the hazing allegations in the suit. Crump: ""It's not the policies that are the issue, it is the people."" Attorney Ben Crump: ""Northwestern violated its own zero tolerance for hazing."" Looks like Northwestern Executive Senior Associate AD Tyler Jones will be leaving Northwestern.

Wishing Tyler all the best at his next stop and in the future! With David Braun now at the helm, become familiar with some names who very well could play integral roles in overseeing both Northwestern’s offense and defense.",131,2023-07-23 17:34:40,2023-07-29 18:42:37

Three former players corroborated the occurrence of a hazing incident mentioned in that suit to Inside NU. Holtz last coached in the college ranks at Louisiana Tech in 2021.

He won the last two USFL titles with the Birmingham Stallions.

32,"Northwestern volleyball had to reload its roster this offseason, but do the ‘Cats have enough offensive firepower to compete in the Big Ten? With the entire starting trio returning to Evanston, Northwestern’s linebackers bring experience to guide a first-year defense. Without Adetomiwa Adebawore and after adding several transfers, Northwestern’s defensive line will undergo adjustments in 2023. Now a senior, Ingrid Falls still has goals to score and assists to kick. According to multiple sources that Inside NU spoke to, including current and former players, Northwestern baseball has decided not to hire Brian Anderson as head coach.

Players were left to share news among themselves — and don’t trust the hiring process. JJTBC calls it a career after five great years in the NFL. Congrats to one of the best to ever do it in purple and white! Northwestern football’s first open practice provided a chance to hear from David Braun, as well as three veteran players. On the field, players partook in drills — and coaches made statements with their clothing choices, sparking more negative headlines. Men’s soccer kicks off its exhibition slate tomorrow, so it’s time to dive into what will help the ‘Cats climb up the ranks of the Big Ten. It’s no secret that Northwestern’s success in 2022 had a lot to do with its defense. How will Nicole Doucette, a starter from last season’s bunch, continue to figure into the mix in 2023? That ends today's media availability. The next is scheduled for Aug. 16. Heard on attention from other programs: ""We mainly focused on ourselves. I just focused on being here and doing what I have to do."" Heard, when asked if hazing has a place in sports: ""I don't think we want to comment on that.""

All three said they didn't consider transferring. Kirtz on receiver transfer adds: ""We've definitely helped each other out on the field.""

Called A.J. Henning ""fast and quick."" Noted that Cam Johnson's ""played a lot of football.""

""It's been great having them in the room."" Gallagher on camp differences: ""I honestly think that Coach Braun and the whole staff has done a good job keeping it as normal as they can. Keeping that as close to what we've been used to."" Kirtz on what he knew about Braun: ""I definitely did not know much about Coach Braun, just because he was a defensively guy.

He works as an assistant now. We've really just been there for him."" Heard said that the team hasn't been focused on what things ""outside of the people have.""

We're really excited to keep mastering that during training camp.""

Heard: ""I think he's gone a great job of trying to create more opportunities for the players."" Gallagher said it's been a ""fresh of fresh air"" to get back on the field.

""Just making sure our focus is on Rutgers."" Heard: ""We've always had great leaders in the program. It's just our time to step up."" Kirtz: ""Coach Braun, he's been preaching that we should stick together. The shirts are really just a reminder to stick together.""

""That's going to take some good time,"" on him realizing he's the head coach. That concludes the open practice portion for Northwestern football. We'll hear from head coach David Braun, LB Bryce Gallagher, DB Rod Heard II and WR Bryce Kirtz shortly. After losing four of their Week Zero starters from 2022, the ‘Cats’ O-Line will feature a lot of new faces (and a lot of uncertainty) heading into the 2023 campaign. Washington and Oregon are now in the Big Ten, creating an 18-team mega-conference.  breaks down what it means for Northwestern, the Big Ten, the schedule and college sports as a whole. David Braun takes over a team embattled in a scandal coming off its worst season since 1981, not exactly ideal for a coaching debut.

The expectations are low, but meeting some goals can help set the ‘Cats on the right path of their rebuild. Emma Phillips went viral for a bicycle kick against Kansas State last season. What does she have in store for 2023? Now an undisputed leader on the team, Alia Marshall has high expectations heading into 2023.",57,2023-08-07 15:36:03,2023-08-12 19:16:51
33,"After adding several veteran transfers, the Wildcats will look to get over the hump in Shane Davis’ eighth season. Despite being an FCS opponent, the Bison are coming off a solid 2022 and boast talented players. The Wildcats will have to overcome losses on both sides if they want to return to the top of the mountain. Over a month after Jim Foster was placed on “indefinite suspension,” Northwestern has found his successor in Michigan assistant Ben Greenspan. BREAKING: After placing Jim Foster on indefinite suspension in mid-July, Northwestern baseball has hired Ben Greenspan as its next head coach.

Greenspan was previously the associate head coach and recruiting coordinator at Michigan. The first vote on the new Ryan Field is less than a week away, but the new stadium is far from a done deal. The ‘Cats kicked off their soccer season last night, beating Marquette handily. The outing offered a promising set of answers to questions that drift over the team in the season ahead: After winning the Rose Bowl, No. 7 Penn State has its sights set on a conference title and a top-four ranking in 2023. It doesn’t get more veteran than Peyton Halsey, who’s played in every game over the last four seasons. The fifth-year looks to cap off her career with an exclamation: Fifteen minutes, 3-0, and we could not possibly be more back The full letter from Schill:  Earlier today, Schill sent a letter to the Evanston community, indicating that Northwestern is willing to hold just six concerts per year at the new stadium. Moreover, NU will limit ""community-based activities"" at the new Ryan Field and its plazaz to 60 days per year. Schill noted that NU ""would have to make a similar financial investment to restore the current, crumbling Ryan Field"" as it would to build a new stadium.

In addressing scandals, Schill said that the project has ""challenges [that] require extraordinary care, time and healing."" In a new letter, Northwestern president Michael Schill called continuing construction of the new Ryan Field ""the right thing for Northwestern and the residents of Evanston.""

Added that it ""will help us create an opportunity to build toward a positive and exciting future."" The Gophers have lost a lot of crucial pieces from their 2022 team, but still have some of the conference’s brightest stars on both sides of the ball. Northwestern will look to earn its first victory over the Blue Devils since 2016, but it will not get any easier this year. It all starts with No. 8. Aurea del Carmen is back, and so is her team (literally, tonight!). Just as she was in 2022, the forward should be a primary offensive catalyst for a squad with Big Ten title aspirations. Despite “open competition,” Northwestern football’s starting quarterback should be known this weekend. That, and more from what HC David Braun, QB Ben Bryant, WR A.J. Henning and DL Richie Hagarty shared with media on Wednesday: Big Ten Soccer quickly learned the name Caterina Reggazoni last season, as the first-year dominated the midfield and earned the Big Ten Freshman of the Year title. 

As 2023 approaches, expect the rising sophomore to put on an encore. With NU captain Danika Austin returning for one last season with the Wildcats, the fifth year will try to build off a remarkable 2022 campaign and guide the stout ‘Cats’ defense in 2023. After splitting time at the beginning of last season with Mia Raben, Reiley Fitzpatrick looks to secure the starting keeper job for the entire 2023 season. Bridget Mitchell made her impact felt as soon as she stepped on the field, burying the winning goal to send the Wildcats to the Sweet 16 last season. 

With an increase in minutes, expect No. 2 to have plenty of opportunities to find the back of the net. Northwestern’s first non-con opponent of 2023 dealt with its own inconsistencies last season but is far from a pushover. That concludes today's media availability. Bryant said that he and his dad attended ""a couple"" of Northwestern games.

Said that his high school coaches were big supporters of Northwestern. Henning on the offense: ""Knowing our assignments, doing the little things right, it's going to play a huge role.""

Also noted the importance of repetition. Hagarty on season expectations: ""We're going for it all. Everybody wants to win, and that's what we're focused on.""

Said that the goal is ""absolutely"" to win a Big Ten title. Henning said he knew of Bryant in high school, plus several former Lincoln-Way East teammates.

""We were actually on our official visits together, the same day,"" he said of coming to NU. Bryant: ""We're excited to go out there and play football. We're worried about us completing camp strong."" Henning said that players have taken each day seriously, with the goal of winning the Big Ten Championship. Hagarty: ""I'm coming from a smaller program. It's a lot different as far as the depth. It's definitely a big change-up, but it's definitely a positive change-up.""

Bryant: ""I've been blown away from the moment I stepped on campus here."" Bryant said there's competition between position groups in the team auditorium every day before practice.

Hagarty added that it's included shooting hoops and playing MarioKart.

Bryant and Hagarty said that Coach Spanos is ""really good."" Henning on his experience playing in big games: ""Just being an older guy, been playing college football for a while. Bringing that level of intensity in the meeting room. Doing the little things right. I know what it takes to get there. Sprinkling to all rooms on the team."" Hagarty on his role in the defense: ""Being an older guy and having that mentor-type deal, I'm integrating as a leader role."" Bryant: ""I think we've all had a great experience. Since we've gotten here, it's been nothing but positive. We've tried our best to just block out the outside noise.""

All three said they haven't felt the need to have dialogue.

""All we know is what we know."" Hagarty on Braun's system: ""The biggest challenge overall is that a lot of guys have competition overall. It's definitely different level. Everybody can play. Everybody's ready to roll."" Hagarty on playing NU last year: ""It was a good feeling. Never something I look back on now. I was trying to come here out of high school. I'm very excited for where this program's going."" Bryant on his connection with receivers: ""I think just getting around them a lot. We threw a lot in the summer. Whenever we're on the field and stuff happens, we're always talking to those guys. It's gotten better and better throughout camp."" More: ""The best guy's going to play."" Bryant on the competition: ""Everyone's welcomed me with open arms. Quarterback room, I can't speak enough about how awesome they've been. Coach Jake's such a great coach.""

Called it one of the ""smartest quarterback rooms"" he's ever been around. Henning on his role for the offense: ""Anything, I'm up for it. I feel like I can affect the game in multiple ways.""

Noted his versatility of playing outside or inside. That concludes Braun's availability. We'll hear from Bryant, Henning and Hagarty shortly. On the first home game: ""I certainly hope that this community, our alumni, all those that are associated with Northwestern University, will come out and show full support for 103 young men that have worked their butts off.""

Said he's ""really confident"" that will occur. Braun on the team's reception at Rutgers: ""I don't know. We've certainly thought of it. I think some of that is speculation, which I certainly can't speak to.""

Said that the team has provided ""tools"" to handle the environment. Braun on deciding on a QB: ""At the end of the day, it'll be my decision, but I'm going to lean on Mike [Bajakian] heavily.""

Emphasized his collaborative efforts with coaches.

""A great quarterback finds a way to rally a football team."" Braun on the offensive line: ""I feel good about the depth. I feel very good about the trajectory of that group.""

Said that OL coach Kurt Anderson has worked with different combinations and positions. Braun on his new coaching staff: ""As each day has gone by, we've become more and more comfortable. Still have a lot to learn.""

Said he's still talked to Matt Entz at NDSU. Braun on A.J. Henning: ""His connection with both [QBs] is really impressive. He's such a great energy in the building.""

Called him an ""enormous headache"" in terms of defensive gameplanning. Noted his work lining up in the backfield and slot, and on jet sweeps. Braun: ""There's very clearly open communication lines. Those relationships have been built, and will continue to be built.""

Said he feels ""very comfortable"" communicating with athletic administration. Said that the team is ""very calculated"" about that area. Braun on preseason traditions: ""We've had an opportunity to go through extensive education when it comes to hazing. That education will continue. We're being very mindful of making sure that we find ways to allow this team to build, and become cohesive, and have fun."" Says that he and Hagarty have shared ""wisdom"" about being fathers. Braun said that DL Richie Hagarty has a ""really neat story"" and a ""sense of purpose.""

""He's very intentional about the way he approaches practice. He's going to bring a different energy to the room. He's going to show up ready to work in everything that he does."" Braun: ""Our focus has shifted to Rutgers. Our focus has shifted to serving these young men. The best way we can serve them right now is focusing on getting a win in New Jersey."" Stressed the depth of the group and ""rotating guys in.""

""There's a certain level of camaraderie in that room that's really special."" Braun on the defensive line: ""Coach Smith has done an incredible job developing the young men. I see a group that has a lot of room for improvement, is not where they need to be at today. A group, Week One, that can help us win a football game."" Braun on quarterbacks: ""We're still in an open competition.""

Said he'll make a decision after Saturday's scrimmage.

Noted that Brendan Sullivan can make an impact with his legs.

""Both are doing a great job of competing."" Braun: ""This team has done a great job of showing a great deal of resolve."" Braun said there's a ""lot of excitement"" about the upcoming season.

Added that he and the operations staff ventured to Ryan Field for the first time yesterday to determine how they'll operate on gamedays. David Braun in his opening statement: ""It's been fun to get into some of that prep. Have a scrimmage this coming Saturday. Two-deeps are starting to work themselves out.""

Said the Rutgers game is ""quickly on the horizon."" Here in the Walter Athletics Center Team Auditorium, where we'll hear from Northwestern HC David Braun, QB Ben Bryant, WR A.J. Henning and DL Richie Hagarty in around 20 minutes. Stay tuned for updates! The last time Northwestern won on American soil was in October 2021 against Rutgers.

Can the ‘Cats end their 687-day streak against the Scarlet Knights on opening day? Though David Braun enters 2023 with uncertainty about his future as Northwestern’s head coach, these former interim leaders extended their success over years. Think soccer staple, think Ella Hase. The senior is back for more in 2023. The Wildcats will have their best chance of victory early in the season, while matchups with formidable teams loom late in the year. Northwestern is going to look for all the help it can get from its special teams this year. Annabel Skubisz may just be one of the best goalkeepers in all of college field hockey. It’s a new-look group in the defensive backfield, but it’s also one of the more experienced ones on the team. The transfer portal has shaken up the Northwestern depth chart. As the season opener nears, which Wildcat players need to assume bigger roles for the team to improve in 2023?

34,"From the Wildcats’ upcoming football season to even decarbonizing the transportation sector, we cover it all in our latest mailbag. When Northwestern begins its 2023 season at Rutgers, it will have faced a Big Ten team in its opener in four straight seasons — something the ‘Cats haven’t done in more than 40 years.

That, and more fun facts about the Wildcats’ slate: As Northwestern goes through its final mock game before starting the 2023 season, its quarterback position is still up for grabs.

Whoever is under center will significantly alter the ‘Cats’ playbook this upcoming year. Bump on this!! In 2022, the Illini had their first winning season since 2011. But, can Illinois replace the talent lost from that team and do it again in 2023? SIT DOWN YOUNG FELLA  for Aulicino and a dominant 7-0 win!! Side note: First dub in a season opener for NU since 2018! We gather here today to celebrate the size of this absolutely magnificent (season-opening) W Even with a new head coach, two new coordinators and a new face under center, the Boilermakers are looking to reload rather than rebuild. As Northwestern concludes its fall camp and transitions to prep week against Rutgers, hear from head coach David Braun — plus RB Cam Porter, WR Cam Johnson and DL Sean McLaughlin — about the Wildcats’ quarterback battle, team cohesion and more. “For the first time in a long time, there are thoughts of a Northwestern baseball future that, instead of referencing its demise, are about players thriving within the program because of Greenspan at the helm.” writes  After a slew of changes this offseason, the Wisconsin Badgers look like the preseason favorite to win the Big Ten West in 2023. 

However, whether all the moves on paper will work out on the field is still yet to be seen. That’s all for today’s presser. We will hear from Northwestern Football next on Monday, two days after the team’s mock game. Johnson on the starting quarterback: “No matter who we go with on September 3rd, we’re going to be in good hands.” McLaughlin says he stayed at NU because of the guys in the locker room and has formed bonds that have lasted forever.

Johnson notes this team is as close as any team he’s been a part of and knew he wanted to stay because of how everyone came together this summer. Porter: “Trying to change things can cause you to be something you’re not. I’m just trying to stay consistent and keep playing my way.” McLaughlin, who has a large bandage on his neck, says, “You know the offensive line, they hold sometimes.”

Adds he’s got a bit of an infection he’s working through. McLaughlin: “We have a lot to learn from going off of last year’s tape. We took it on our shoulders trying to be the best position group on the team, we just need to keep stacking practices and getting better.” Cam Johnson says WR coach Armon Binns has taught him a lot of new things to help make him a more complete receiver. Porter says it’s been “awesome” to have former players come back to practice and speak with current players. Cam Porter, Sean McLaughlin and Cam Johnson now to the podium. Braun: “I’m really excited for this team to have the opportunity to go and write their own story.” In regard to the different helmet decals in practice, Braun said the equipment staff wanted to have a little fun with the position groups and it’s created some playful banter. Braun on the whirlwind of the last few months, from NDSU DC to B1G HC: “If you would’ve told me back in December that this was the story, I would have laughed and thought you were crazy.”

Shouted out his wife and kids, coaches, community, alumni and staff for their support. Braun on the statements that have come out: “That stuff is in the rear view. It’s time to look forward, and that road leads to New Jersey.” Braun: “The former student athletes here at Northwestern have been incredible with their attendance at practice, reaching out to players and showing their unwavering support for young men that are going through what they went through.” Braun says the team will name captains soon. Braun: “This team does need a starting quarterback. If there’s a way to tap into the skillsets in the room, let’s tap into that, but this team needs a starting quarterback.” Braun says they’ve had talks internally about the quarterback decision, but are choosing not to make an announcement.

Follow along for updates! MAILBAG: The last time we did a mailbag was June 17. Of course, it's been a pretty quiet summer in the world of Northwestern sports (*waves hands frantically*), and football season is less than 2 weeks away. 

Drop questions, NU-related or not, and we'll answer them this week. Iowa’s offense was abysmal last season, holding back one of the best defenses in the nation. 

Even with Cade McNamara at the helm, can the Hawkeyes score enough to compete in the Big Ten? After a long few months of no sports, women’s soccer started off the fall season this past weekend. After Maryland had its best season since 2019, Taulia Tagovailoa and the Terps look to continue their success and take on the Big Ten. With Matt Rhule at the helm, Nebraska looks to turn around a historic program that has not been to a bowl game since 2016. 

Can Rhule recreate his success at past stops, or will the Huskers fail to get over the hump? Northwestern Women’s Soccer had a tremendous season in 2022, reaching the Sweet 16 for just the third time in program history. 

The ‘Cats return numerous key figures in 2023, but it will take much more than just talent to sustain success.",41,2023-08-20 17:02:56,2023-08-26 16:13:09

Game-ending goals against Boston    College Just like Northwestern football, Pound the Talk is so back.

Hosts  and  are joined by  to analyze the Wildcats’ position groups, give their X-factors for Sunday’s matchup with Rutgers and predict who will win. Before Northwestern ventures to Piscataway, here’s an in-depth look at the Rutgers Scarlet Knights on both sides of the ball. “Being the record holder of an impressive feat will get you recognized by many. Being the record holder of an infamous one will get you recognized by more,” writes .

Can Northwestern end its 23-month American drought on Sunday? After two losses out in Hawaii to open the season last weekend, Northwestern pulled off a top-15 upset thanks to its depth. If Northwestern comes out on top in Piscataway, its play from its quarterback and secondary will likely pave the way. Things can only go up. “It is a new era for the Wildcats. It is one that no one expected, but it is the situation at hand. Normally, a new era brings hope for a brighter future, but right now, there is a dark cloud surrounding NUFB,” writes . Northwestern has released its five captains, with Gallagher earning the honor for a second straight year. With Northwestern set to kick off in a few days, what constitutes a successful season has nothing to do with the ‘Cats’ record. Northwestern Men’s Soccer is off to its best start in a decade. takes a look at how the ‘Cats did it. Despite immense offensive pressure from the ‘Cats in their season opener, they came up just short in a top-10 clash against Louisville on Sunday. THE KING IS BACK Before his first ever game as a head coach, hear from David Braun about preparing for the Scarlet Knights, deciding on a starting quarterback and more. From coaching battles to receiver-corner duels, Week One will have it all. Game-winning goals and some clutch assists...what more could you ask for? In Week 2, it felt like once the goals started flowing, they couldn’t stop. That’s all for today’s presser, players will begin speaking to the media next week.

The next time we hear from David Braun, it’ll be in Piscataway. Braun on whether Fitz has helped him with advising through this process: “I’m focused on running this program, and running this program [with] the people that are in this building day-in and day-out.” Braun says several Big Ten coaches have spoken to him, either in person at Big Ten Media Days or through text and on the phone, have reached out to him.

Notes Greg Schiano of Rutgers as one that he met at Media Days. Braun on the biggest thing that will motivate the team to wins this year: “Brotherhood.” Braun says it was a difficult decision to choose the starting quarterback, but is confident in the depth of the room.

Really emphasizes how much the team needs a “starting quarterback” rather than switching between guys early. Braun: “I am extremely confident in my ability to lead, to inspire, to meet people where they’re at, to pull people together for a common purpose.”

“I know I’m up to the challenge, but I’m up to the challenge because of the great people around me.” Braun: “They’re ready to compete. You can feel that in the building.” Braun: “There’s no better way to create value on an NFL team early on than to show your value on special teams.” Braun on the RB room post-Hull: “Cam Porter is awesome. His maturity and the way he carries himself… Anthony Tyus [is] what you want in a Big Ten back. Joseph Himon continues to really impress me.” Braun says captains will be announced this week, notes he’s really impressed by the number of different players that were voted for. Braun says they’ve made the decision on a starting quarterback, but will be keeping the decision in-house. Braun: “We have quite a task on our hands. Having the chance to look at Rutgers over the course of the last few months… we’re playing a team that’s well prepared, well coached, very fundamentally sound and will play a physical brand of Big Ten football.” First regular season presser on the way! David Braun speaking first. You can probably tell that it's an odd year. After making history in 2022, the 'Cats have a chance to do it again. Year 3 of the Russell Payne era is off to a hot start, and Northwestern is 2-0 for the first time since 2014  Northwestern outshot Louisville 21-3, and the Cardinals didn’t even get a shot off until the second half. Just a really tough break for the No. 2 Wildcats, who drop their season opener for the first time since 2018. *Evan Hull hive buzz intensifies* Could Evan Hull start for the Colts? Can Rashawn Slater returning finally push the Chargers over the hump?

Saka added, ""We're going to celebrate this. We're going to keep it rolling."" Mueller on third-down stops: ""That was one of the first things that we talked about in defensive meetings.

Now, I look at that group and go 'How good can we be?'"" ""That dude was not going to be denied."" Braun on a moment that changed momentum: ""There's not a specific play that comes to mind, but you could just sense it. We were staying ahead of the sticks.""

""It was fun to see him out there."" Braun on the uses of Lausch and Henning: ""A.J.'s just really difficult, because you don't know where he's going to line up.

I know that I'm ready for this moment.""

Said it ""still feels surreal."" Braun on running the ball well: ""I think it was a commitment to it. Staying with it, and utilizing all of our guys. We talked about these types of moments. We're going to win games with our fundamentals, with our technique.""

Said Cam Porter ""embodied"" a Big Ten RB. Braun on what the win means to the program: ""I don't know if we needed it. What we need is just continued support, and need one another. But, my gosh does it feel good."" Braun said he told players at the Ryan Field scrimmage that Northwestern has won by ""being a great fourth-quarter team.""

""There's nothing flashy about how the 'Cats are going to win."" Braun on adjustments in the second half: ""We keep talking about complimentary football. What complimentary football is, it's not flashy. It's not instant gratification. It takes time."" Braun on his first career win: ""I'll tell you right now: this is our win. It means so much to me because it was with an incredible group of people."" Braun: ""I really want to thank everyone that came out today. We've talked about in fall camp how critical it is for us to protect Ryan Field. We got off to a great start today.""

Braun notes ""your fandom means more now than ever."" Six games in, it looks like the ‘Cats are cooking up something special. “Shout out to him for being who he is, and looking out for us. We’re going to look out for him the same way.”

Despite being Northwestern’s QB2, junior Brendan Sullivan is wholeheartedly rooting for Ben Bryant, focusing on NU’s goals rather than his own. The Wildcats are still without a loss, but the results have been better than their actual performances. “In simplest terms, Northwestern fell flat, sputtering its way to a 17-point loss, leaving fans questioning what a path back up the ladder even looks like.” writes .

Braun said he tries to ""speak truth"" into the team, in sharing his belief in the team.

Braun on the 12-game losing streak: ""There's no excuses. There's no explanations. What solutions are we finding to play winning football? The easy thing to fall back on is, 'Hey, this is a new team.' Evaluate it, move forward and find a way to play winning football."" Braun: ""After a loss like yesterday, I'm going to have a tendency to shoulder as much burden as I possibly can. We're going to be all right. There's plenty of positives to take from this, too."" Braun said D.J. Vokolek is ""incredibly involved"" in what the defense does and helps gameplanning with ""organization.""

""We've got great minds in that defensive room.""

Said that Skip Holtz is an ""extra eye"" in terms of the offense. Braun on coaching mechanics: ""It's a lot of conversation. Good conversation on gameday stems from conversation prior to gameday. Certainly communication with Coach Bajakian, with Coach Holtz at times in between series."" Braun on Devin Turner: ""It's really exciting. He's showing up, he's flashing, but he'll be the first one to tell you he's got so much room for improvement. There's some things that he needs to continue to improve on in his consistency. He knows that."" Braun on designed blitzes: ""A lot of those pressures were very calculated in terms of attacking the run game. None of the things that you saw in the second half were strong deviations from the gameplan.""

Noted that were still adjustments made, but ""within the framework."" Braun on the quarterback decision: ""Ben will be our starter for UTEP. Proud of the way Sully came in. You take stock in everything. Everything's being evaluated. Ben knows he needs to play better."" Braun on the offensive line: ""That group knows that we need to improve. That's something that they recognize as well.""

Said there are also positives to take. Braun said there's no update on Matt Lawson's injury.

""I do feel good about the D-line depth right now."" Called it a moment where we ""needed to build so momentum.""

Said he wishes Rod Heard II would have pushed his route a bit more vertically.

""In a perfect world, would have had it dialed up on a fourth-and-six. We went out to New Jersey to win a football game."" Braun on the fake punt: ""We had talked about that for multiple weeks now. Knew that Rutgers was a heavy pressure team, was going to find ways to come after multiple punts throughout the day. Were very calculated in terms of the specific scenario."" Braun on Northwestern being an underdog to UTEP: ""I've never paid attention to lines, never will. I think this group is at its best when it's an underdog."" Braun: ""There were plays out there. Plenty of missed opportunities.""

Said the preparation for UTEP has already started, with 30% of meetings today being ""review of Rutgers."" Braun said the team needs to ""start faster on defense,"" emphasizing both sides of the ball being afflicted because of long Rutgers drives. Braun in his opening statement: ""Certainly disappointed with yesterday's result. There's some positive things to build off of. We're going to build off of those things. Plenty to identify in terms of a lot of work to be done in all three phases."" Here in the Walter Athletics Center Team Auditorium, where David Braun will speak to the media shortly.

""It's really an everyone thing, but I thought they played really hard."" Bryant on Braun's message to the team: ""Play together. The whole motto this whole summer and into the season is 'together' and I think that'll stay into the season."" Bryant on how Rutgers' time of possession affected the offense: ""We had to sustain drives, and that was a killer.""

Hey, it wasn't a shutout! I am not okay TOUCHDOWN NORTHWESTERN!!!!! Caleb Komolafe in his first career game with a short reception! Sullivan plunges across the line to gain on a fourth and one, as the clock ticks closer to zero. Northwestern could avoid the shutout, as the offense is now at the Rutgers 17. Brendan Sullivan appears to have entered the game for Bryant with a little under three minutes to go. Northwestern recovers a muffed punt at the Rutgers 45. Bryant gets stripped on a sack, and on the next play he gets pummeled again. It's a 4th and 32, and Renner punts again. Johnson was open down the sideline, and Bryant dropped it in, but he got hit very, very hard. The ASU transfer is down, and there's no foul for targeting. Bryant finds Johnson for a big gain over the middle, but it comes back on a hold from Ben Wrather. It's just that type of day. A punt! I'm sorry, everyone. BEN BRYANT WHITE LIGHTNING AGAIN Now THIS is a real Big Ten football offense. END OF THE THIRD: Rutgers 24, Northwestern 0
Don't know about you, but I've got nothing. Obligatory: who decided this game was on CBS again? Bryant almost gets picked, and Northwestern will punt again. Matt Lawson is out for the remainder of the game with a lower body injury, per Northwestern. Monangai jukes his way for a 15-yard rush TD into the end zone. The Knights are about to make this a 24-0 ballgame with four minutes in the third quarter to go. Wimsatt converts on third down, on a sneak. Rutgers now inside the 15. A first down for Benjamin on third and short. Running out of ways to say it, this defense just cannot finish. It was Matt Lawson, who needed two staffers to help him off the field. Monangai breaks Gallagher's ankles in the flats, and picks up 20 on a screen. To make matters worse, a NU player is down, and appears to be hurt. A sack from Bryant, and another punt. It took a while, but Big Ten West football is back! I, for one, would like to be in College Park right now. Henning gets the ball on a designed run, but is wrapped up for a loss of six. Jaylen Pate and Anto Saka pressure Wimsatt, who stumbles on a 3rd-and-10 to bring up a fourth down.

The ensuing punt gets downed at the NU 25. Third-down conversion again. It's Isaiah Washington who gets to the sticks. Bryce Gallagher with a solid pressure on a broken-up screen, bringing up a 3rd-and-8 for Rutgers. It's a 49-yarder, which is fair-caught just inside Rutgers' 25. Henning gets some separation down the right sideline, but Bryant overthrows him. Renner is coming out for the punt. After Porter gets bottled up for just a two-yard run, Bryant gets hit as he throws it away on second down. Northwestern needs eight yards to avoid a three-and-out. The second half is off, and Northwestern will start off at its own 25. HALFTIME: Rutgers 17, Northwestern 0
Welcome to 2023. Frank Covey didn't get his feet in, but WOW was that a nice catch on the sideline from the true first-year in his debut. Hollis breaks up a pass in the corner of the end zone, and Rutgers' 38-yarder bangs off the right upright. Northwestern will likely head into the locker room down 17-0. Northwestern wraps up another run, and Greg Schiano takes his final timeout with 19 seconds to go. Third and 10 for Rutgers from the Northwestern 20. It stands, and Rutgers has 36 seconds to try and get into the end zone. It's under review, as Isaiah Washington reached the ball out right at the sticks as he was getting tackled. Third down conversion for Rutgers. In other news, the sky is blue. Wimsatt fires a completion for five, and NU wraps up Monangai at the line of scrimmage. Third and five for the Scarlet Knights, who take their second timeout with 45 ticks to go. An interception for Bryant on a botched snap with pressure in his face. Rutgers gets the ball with 1:16 to go, and just under 30 yards from the end zone. Bryant starts out the two-minute drive with completions to Porter and Lang, but the starting RB gets hit at the line on a second down run from the NU 29.  Timeout, Northwestern with 1:19 to play in the half. We have seen a three and out. The second straight drive with a turnover on downs. Rutgers gets the ball again. Porter gets blown up at the line for a loss of one, bringing up fourth down. 'Cats are going for it, with three receivers and a tight end and Bryant in shotgun. Bryant gets sacked, and is stripped from behind. NU falls on it though, bringing up a 2nd and 13. Benjamin Bryant, WHITE LIGHTNING Under pressure, Bryant steps to his left and finds Jacob Gill to make it a 3rd and 4 from the NU 48. Bryant fires a BULLET up the middle to Cam Johnson for 15, picking up the first down. But, a false start moves NU five yards back. Thomas Gordon with his first reception, picking up two yards. NORTHWESTERN GETS OFF THE FIELD ON THIRD DOWN (ignoring that Rutgers just went up 17-0) Richie Hagarty forces a 3rd and 7. Prayer circle time. Pass interference on Hollis on the first play from scrimmage, which brings the ball to the NU 30 for Rutgers. Even MORE Rutgers offense for us on national television, ladies and gentlemen! FAKE PUNT from Renner!!!!! Rod Heard with the catch, and he gets out of bounds right at the sticks... but does not get there. Sigh. Bryant remains in the game after getting hit hard. Porter takes the carry for about a yard, bringing up a third and eight. No targeting on the play, and no penalty. Bryant comes off the edge and gets hit hard on the slide. The refs call targeting on Desmond Igbinosun, which is under review. Porter picks up the first down up the middle, rushing for four. Northwestern's first carry of the day goes to Henning, who comes off the edge for seven yards. It's hard to stay sane when the defense gives up 7 of 10 late down conversions in the first 17 minutes of the game. Touchdown, Wimsatt. AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH Braun takes a timeout on a 3rd and 4 from the NU 6. We have lost count of the number of third down conversions, and Xander Mueller got blown up on a block. Someone help. END OF Q1: Rutgers 7, Northwestern 0

The Scarlet Knights are dominating the clock, and have constantly moved the chains on late downs with a chance to add another score. The new-look offense showed flashes during its few minutes with the ball. Wimsatt overthrows his intended receiver, only for a 13-yard reception to still happen. THIRD fourth down conversion of the quarter. We are so, soooo back. On third down, Monangai gets right to the sticks on a run to set up another fourth down. Rutgers is going for it. Again. Devin Turner just cleaned someone's clock. WOW. Out of the injury timeout, Wimsatt picks up nine on a throw to Johnny Langan, setting up Ja'shon Benjamin to move the chains on a run up the middle.

Spencer and Bryce Gallagher on the tackle. Jalon Calhoun with a 13-yard catch on the first play from scrimmage, and then Leonard escapes the pocket for seven yards. Renner's punt goes for 29.

-NU partnered with Paciolan, a ticketing company
-Points accumulate over four years
-Certain games, like volleyball's clash with No. 1 Wisconsin on Friday, will be worth more points (eight to be exact) Northwestern Athletics sent students information about its new student ticket point system, which is intent on ""rewarding most passionate and supportive students.""

Women's basketball games count for five points, the most. The system will have four ""claim windows"" for MBB. That'll wrap us up here. Also: ""It's not just Ben, but the entire team. I've been really encouraged by what we've seen, but it's the consistency we need going forward."" Braun on Ben Bryant: ""Expectations out of Ben are for him to perform on Saturday the way he practices.

""The level of consistency that we see in practice is what we need to see in games going to forward."" ""What makes Northwestern special is its world-class academics with the ability to experience Big Ten athletics. [The freshman class] will play a critical role in giving us home-field advantage for the next four years."" Braun on speaking to the incoming first-years at Wildcat Welcome: ""It would've gone off much better if I knew how to operate the mic.""

""In some ways, it was very humbling to take some time with the group that is absolutely critical to the student-athlete experience."" Braun on Cam Johnson: ""I think there's just a level of confidence with Cam, that's contagious. Don't hear him speak much, going over the top, but it's talking with the QB, the receivers, encouraging guys.""

""He's a consistent performer in practice."" Braun on Anto Saka: ""The young man can rush the passer. We don't want Anto to be satisfied being a third-down specialist, we want Anto to strive to continue to strive to be an every-down guy."" On usage of Henning in 13 personnel: ""It's something that I certainly trust that Coach Bajakian's staff is doing a good job of self-evaluating.""

""What I can tell you is, football is a game of matchups, and credit to that tight end group."" Braun on Ryan Field hosting its first 2023 game with students on campus : ""Honestly I don't know what to expect. But really excited to have students back, for it to be Wildcat Welcome, to have the incoming freshmen at Ryan Field with the rest of the student body.""

Couple punts he'd like to have back, but full faith in what he's able to do."" Braun on the tight ends and O-line vs. Duke: ""I think it was not where we needed to be. But there were moments of production and process that it was exactly what we were looking for."" Braun on practice adjustments regarding tackling: ""I feel like some of those fundamentals in tackling have shown up in the positive light. Just because a few missed tackles showed up against a quality opponent, doesn't mean you have to hit the panic button."" Braun on run defense adjustments against Minnesota: ""It all starts off with our fundamentals and technique. Mentioned tackling, knowing gap coverage, and starting fast.

""Minnesota, when they're ahead, is at their best. We need to find away to get them out of their comfort zone."" Braun on improvement: ""I've seen improvement from Rutgers day in and day out."" However, he also noted that ""it did not show up on Saturday.""

""There's no doubt in our opportunities on the road so far we have not started fast, and we have not played well."" Braun : ""[The Minnesota game] will certainly embody what Big Ten football is all about."" Braun: ""Shifting into Big Ten West football, which this group is really excited about. Returning to Ryan Field against a very, very, very physical opponent that knows what it takes to win in the Big Ten West."" Braun: ""Did not go down to Durham and play our best football.

Said that the faith is ""still there."" Johnson on the versatility of the receiver room: ""We have so much depth in our receiver room. I think that that's honestly really good for our team. It's made us as receivers better. It gives the quarterbacks and ourselves a lot of confidence that we can go hard every play."" Johnson on Brendan Sullivan: ""I've gotten to work with Sully since we first got here. He's been a guy that's taken charge. He's been a great leader for our team, even when he hadn't been the No. 1 quarterback. There was no flinch for us."" Hagarty on playing well against PSU: ""Ultimately, at the end of the day, it's disappointing to not get a team win. Obviously, we're going to try to put our best attributes on the field no matter what."" Johnson on Ben Bryant: ""Haven't had a chance to talk with him. I think that Ben did a good job of being tough, standing in the pocket, making plays under duress, making plays with his feet."" Hagarty said that the early fumble ""sparked a lot of momentum.""

""We've got to continue that momentum, offensively."" Hagarty on run defense: ""Obviously, we just trust in ourselves. That's the main thing that we've been in doing. Breaking our backs for each other, essentially. Going 110%, never giving up. Knowing that you've got troops and cavalry coming."" Johnson on succeeding against PSU's secondary: ""I think that's sort of what I came here for. I think that we had a good gameplan, and that the offense did a good job of executing. The coaches put me in a good spot to show what I can do. Would've much rather have had a team win."" Cam Johnson and Richie Hagarty now at the podium. Braun on the receiver room: ""I just love to watch these guys work and compete. The consistency they show in practice. Awfully proud of that group. It's not a surprise."" Braun on the offensive run game: ""Part of that's just balance. Part of that's finding ways to stay the course, stay patient, even if we're down by seven or 10. Heck of a job last week by our team, but even against Minnesota, we've got to find ways to play with a lead."" Braun on James Franklin's quietude quote: ""Do we know when Penn State returns to Evanston? I saw a student section that started to show up. I saw a group of energized fans. I saw a football program that's trending in the right direction. Lot of awesome stuff to get behind."" Braun on run defense: ""I think so much of it comes back to playing with a knock-back mentality. Establishing the line of scrimmage. Finish every play unblocked. That is being physical, playing with violent hands, getting off of blocks. You have to destruct blocks."" Braun on special teams: ""That's what Northwestern football is all about. Especially considering the situation with our roster right now, every single player on our roster plays an absolutely critical role. We don't need four-star, five-star guys running down on kickoffs."" Braun on the second half: ""At the end of the day, everyone's going to look at this game, and look at who Penn State is. No one on the outside expected us to win this football game, for many reasons. We expected to.""

Said the first half showed ""what we're capable of."" Also called PSU's RBs a ""talented, talented group."" Braun on PSU players who stood out: ""Specifically, just with my lens, at their offense, were the quarterback. His arm talent. His consistency. Being able to push the ball to the field, number one. His decision-making. His ability to extend some plays with his feet."" Braun on the offensive line: ""We'll take a look at the tape. I thought that group made enormous strides last week against Minnesota.""

Noted PSU's structure and aggressiveness.

""The best thing you can do with an opponent like that is stay in the game."" Braun on playing better in the first half: ""I challenged that defensive line in a positive manner. I think we're starting to have an understanding of what we can be as a defensive line group. We need that group to continue to mature, develop and be a huge factor."" Braun: ""We needed to take calculated risks to elongate drives."" Braun: ""All we chase after is right in front of us."" Braun on decision making: ""The expectation was trying to win the football game."" Braun: ""Very disappointed in the result, but proud of our effort.""

The Wildcats’ second-half heroics couldn’t proliferate against the No. 6 team in the country. FINAL: No. 6 Penn State 41, Northwestern 13

The Nittany Lions outscored the Wildcats 31-3 in the second half, courtesy of short fields and better offensive play.

Also known as a normal day’s lunch for  The firepower is coming from everywhere. The Wildcats are still unblemished at home so far this year. Before ushering in No. 6 Penn State, read some tongue-in-cheek theories about why NU has succeeded at Ryan Field. The Wildcats dropped their first two conference games of the year against top competition. Against a vaunted Penn State team on both sides, the Wildcats will need their offense — and belief — to shine through if they want to down the No. 6 Nittany Lions. Northwestern stock: way up “In a game that felt gone, in a season that already felt lost, the Wildcats weren’t ready to throw in the towel. All of a sudden, a team that looked dead in the water came roaring back to life,” writes  Plenty of ‘Cats saw pro action last weekend, and a few made a meaningful impact: Northwestern’s wild fourth-quarter comeback was truly a team effort, as displayed by these 10 plays that left their mark on the outcome. David Braun met with the media as the ‘Cats get ready to take on No. 6 Penn State in Evanston. After achieving a surprising comeback against Minnesota, Northwestern will face its toughest match yet, and maybe of the season, in Penn State. The New York Jets' savior is none other than Touchdown Trevor. Just gift-wrap trophy No. 9 already That concludes today's presser. Braun on the linebacker rotation: ""We're really excited both those guys [Mueller and Uihlein] are playing right now. Plan on utilizing both those guys, and both their skillsets.""

Said that Mueller was ""playing fast"" and came up with ""big-time plays"" in the fourth quarter. Braun on if he's talked to other NU HCs: ""There hasn't been a ton of time to spend with the other head coaches, other than all head coaches meeting here and there. I have been just incredibly impressed with not only the quality of coaches within this program, but the...people."" Said there's a ""strong connection"" between Penn State's offensive production and the talent it has. Braun on utilizing last year's PSU tape: ""You certainly take a look at it. There's a lot of opportunities just to see how they attack certain fronts, certain coverages, certain alignments. The conditions certainly played a huge role in that game."" ""If that's what's meant to be in the long run, that's an honor and a privilege. That's not what we're concerned with right now."" Braun on if he's had discussions about losing the interim tag: ""There hasn't been. As I've said before, I think it can be a very easy distraction, or trap, to fall into, to allow your mind to wander.""

Posited that he and his wife were ""put in this role for a reason."" Braun on ball control moving forward: ""It sounds really cliche, but so much of it comes back to some of the urgency and edge. It all starts at the line of scrimmage. If you want to consistently produce in that area, you better be the most physical team on the field."" Said that Coco Azema plays with a ""different tempo and speed.""

Also praised Jaheem Joseph's stop. Braun on his safeties' tackling: ""It's been fun to see. Obviously, there's been times that the safeties here have been very involved in run fits prior to my arrival. Little different than it has been in the past. Those guys have really stepped up."" Braun on Penn State's defense: ""They're aggressive. They're balanced. You can't find a weakness on that defense. Really well-coached. Willing to play tight coverage. Mix in some different looks. Put stress on you on first and second down."" Braun on Bryce Kirtz's consistency and confidence: ""I think it goes both ways. Especially at the wide receiver position, both those things can be hard to come by. His production was no surprise to us."" Braun on gameday adjustments from support staff: ""It's been a transition directly from our team hotel, directly to Ryan Field.""

Mentioned using the ""atrium area"" into the more traditional locker room.

""They [players] were looking for a new rhythm at home."" Braun on his fourth-down decision to start the game: ""Punting that ball no matter what. Felt like, the way that Minnesota operates offensively, that it could really be a game where possessions were limited. Felt very confident in the decision."" More: ""On both sides of the football, we need to find some of that mojo in the first quarter to get going. I think that only helps an offense turn positive plays into positive drives and points."" Braun on playing better in the first half: ""I think there needs to continue to be focus on consistent execution. That drive stalls out. Two drives later, you're back in rhythm, negative play, that drive stalls out. Some of it comes back to complementary football."" Added that sometimes that desire can interfere with the ability to ""cut it loose"" when on the field, and that Braun has helped extract that fire within players. Braun on the team's passion: ""There's no doubt in my mind that that is within our young men, and burns at a very high level. What I would say is, this group is such a high-character, quality young men that want to do right. They want to do what they're being coached to do."" Noted that the time with family and players after the win was really critical. Braun on reflecting since Saturday: ""The outpouring of support has been really neat. Everywhere from alumni, former players, parents of current players, mentors, people that I've coached with, high school buddies, the list goes on and on."" Braun on Bryant's injury: ""I think it's just part of playing quarterback at this level. Back in the facility today."" Braun added that Ben Bryant started to ""put things on full display"" based on what the team had seen in fall camp.

Said that the offense is ""gelling.""

""I think we saw a group around Ben that was fully supporting him."" Braun on the offensive adjustments: ""In the first half, there were a lot of self-inflicted wounds through penalties. There were moments where we were really moving the ball in the first half.""

Mentioned an ""explosive passing game"" in the second half, plus running well. Braun: ""We have one heck of a football team coming in here. Very well-coached.""

Praised James Franklin for ""coaching in all three phases of the game."" Braun stressed the ""resiliency"" and ""grittiness"" about the Minnesota game, calling it the ""expectation"" and ""what this program's all about."" Braun in his opening statement: ""Excited to be back in our routine. The team was back this morning to review the Minnesota game. What a great opportunity to clean some things up, and identify areas where we need to continue to improve, while also celebrating."" Some frenetic finishes around the conference. Interim head coach David Braun set to speak to the media any moment. Updates to follow! Some bumps along the road. Northwestern football is fun again and that is a total revelation. Northwestern’s goal differential during the streak so far is 28-6 (four of those wins coming over ranked teams)!! “Ultimately, the difficulty of that comeback paled in comparison to the challenges Braun faced this summer. Above all, it’s indicative of the head coach’s resilience, both on the gridiron and off of it,” writes . That wraps up today's pressers. Kirtz on the student section: ""I really do appreciate you guys. It definitely means a lot to the team. Keep coming for sure."" Azema on this win: ""It's the best win because it's the last win. This is exactly what you want to play ball for. It's nice.""

Emphasized that the team will enjoy the victory but then turn the page. Kirtz on his first touchdown: ""They were all huddling around me. It also just changed the energy of our sideline. Really just being able to bring that energy to the team was big for me."" Azema: ""We know we're high-character men. We can't pay attention to the noise. That's all we have to do. We can't change opinions on us. We can just change how people [look at] us based on how we play."" Kirtz on the offense scoring to end: ""We just got to go get another one. There's no other option."" Azema on the team's identity going forward: ""It's a never-give up mentality. Especially when you're down 31-10.""

""We've been through hell all summer, with workouts and everything that happened. A quarter of the season's done, but it's an identity to go forward."" Azema: ""I just feel like Coach Braun's a great guy overall. He's always been there. People want to go to war and fight for that guy.""

Talked about how he lost his brother, and how Braun was there to support him.

""It's never wavering. I want to go fight for somebody like that."" Kirtz on the long road to today: ""These are the guys, we put all the work in. We all make each other better. To go out there and execute as a team, based on the work we put in together, it's really rewarding."" Azema on third-down stops: ""We preach all the time, field goals won't beat us.""

Noted faith in the offense scoring. Azema: ""It goes back to finding our edge. We kept pushing and got it done."" Bryant and Mangieri are done. Azema and Kirtz now at the podium.

Mangieri on anticipating the last play: ""I had a good feeling the ball was coming to me.

""The ball got lost in the lights a little bit, but it was a good ball."" Bryant on the night: ""It's a lot of emotions. As a team we've been through so much, and it's so nice to get a victory in the West.

""I'm very happy with our team and how we executed."" Bryant and Mangieri at the podium. Braun is done. Bryant, Azema, Mangieri, Kirtz. Braun on the penalties: ""I don't think we were penalized enough until this game. I'll live with those.

""I'll tell you what, I don't think we were playing with enough edge in the first three games."" Braun: ""So many guys said, 'Coach, we got you.'"" Braun choked up when talking about the moment. Braun on what went through his mind on the final play to Mangieri: ""A.J. Henning grabbed me. He said, 'Coach, we're going to win this football game.

""Charlie's been a big reason why this program's continued to build through July and August."" Braun on Bryce Kirtz: ""Confidence and consistency. The young man believes in himself, and his teammates.

""So cool to see it pay off the way that it did tonight."" Braun on the field-storming: ""It's incredible. It's what we talked about. Why do you come to Northwestern as a student-athlete, or as a student? It's Big Ten football, a world-class university, and the opportunity to experience the best of both worlds."" Braun on defensive moments that stood out: ""I think the film will tell us more about that. We were all frustrated with what happened in the first half.  ""I think what you saw in the first half was clean football."" Braun on winning in the fourth quarter: ""It's what this program has embodied for a long, long time. It's a reflection on the character of this team.""

Thanked the athletic department staff for ""making adjustments"" on gameday. Braun on the resilience: ""I kept going up and down the sideline. This is what it comes back to in terms of this team. For the first time since I've been here... they weren't flinching. 'Coach, we got this.'"" This got rewritten several times. Braun on Ben Bryant: ""Certainly very proud of Ben.""

Noted that ""everyone"" needed to elevate play.

Stressed the ""resiliency"" and ""toughness"" from Bryant. Braun noted that he tried to display more of that passion today and this week.

""I've got to set the tone for Monday moving forward."" Braun on maintaining winning: ""I think it all starts off with our leadership and our captains. Part of our leadership is me.""

Noted that he has a gift of ""patience and poise"" with a ""burning"" passion and ""competitive spirit."" Braun: ""This is not just a flash in the pan. This is the result of a great week in practice.""

Noted that the players were ""challenged"" and excelled with a ""totally different level of energy"" in practice. Braun: ""We challenged our group to play with urgency, to play with edge. Challenged the group at halftime to stay the course.""

Noted that today was going to be a ""fourth-quarter game,"" or ""however long it takes.""

""Just such a reflection of what this group really stands for."" Braun: ""I don't know much of an opening statement there's going to be. Pretty speechless right now. I think what we saw tonight is a direct reflection of what this group is all about."" David Braun now at the podium. Over two thousand words and we still can’t fully describe what just happened. NORTHWESTERN HAS BEATEN MINNESOTA 37-34, coming back from 21 points down! It's Northwestern's first Big Ten West win at Ryan Field since 2020!! CHARLIE MANGIERIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII Kesich's field goal is good from 20. Minnesota goes up 34-31. Kaliakmanis's pass falls incomplete. Minnesota is kicking here. Williams gets stopped for a yard by P.J. Spencer, bringing up a third-and-goal from the 2. Coco Azema with a big hit, but Kaliakmanis completes the pass for 15. First and goal from the 10. Devin Turner just folded someone in half! However, Theran Johnson got hurt on the play. This will be Northwestern's first overtime game since October 13, 2018 against Nebraska, which was a win. Minnesota will start off with the ball in OT. One second left (technically) END OF REGULATION: Minnesota 31, Northwestern 31
I cannot believe what is happening. And the funniest part is, 75% of the student section is probably in Chicago right now and missed it. The extra point is good. The game is tied. Northwestern has scored 21 points UNANSWERED to tie this game. BRYANT FINDS HENNING. IT'S A TOUCHDOWN WITH 2 SECONDS LEFT!! WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING! An end zone fade to Johnson falls incomplete. He is down in the corner of the end zone, and appears to be hurt. 

Five seconds left. Eight seconds left. Henning for 11. Northwestern is now at the 12. Bryant finds Himon for a short pickup, and then Thomas Gordon goes for 16 down the sideline, stopping the clock with 18 seconds left.  'Cats at the 23 now. Johnson was open on the sideline, but can't stay inbounds. Loud ""defense"" chants from the Minnesota faithful in attendance. A hold on Tiernan moves the ball back to the Minnesota 47 with 46 ticks left. Bryant finds Thomas Gordon, moving the chains again. Bryant gets taken down, but it's a facemask on Minnesota. Northwestern is going to move into Gopher territory with a minute to play. Bryant to Porter for no gain. Clock is running. Bryant finds Cam Johnson for 11. He gets out of bounds, and NU has the ball at its 37 with 1:26 to go. *20 Minnesota also had a perfect position to down it at the one, and the Gopher stands in the end zone while he does so. Northwestern gets the ball at its 25. 

That is a wild, WILD decision from P.J. Fleck. They're punting?? WHAT?? Xander Mueller with a potentially GAME-SAVING tackle! Fourth-and-3, and the Gophers are going for it from the NU 37. Kaliakmanis finds Brockington for nine yards, bringing up a third-and-2. Braun uses Northwestern's final timeout. This could be game here. After Richie Hagarty wraps up Taylor, NU uses its second timeout of the half with 3:11 to go. Kaliakmanis finds some open field, and scrambles for 19. Coco Azema wraps him up, but not before he reaches NU territory. 3:30 to go and ticking. Renner's punt goes to the Minnesota 33. Bryant's pass falls incomplete. He goes down, and needs some help walking off the field. Follows that up with a Jameis Winston-esque throw that nearly gets picked. Ben Bryant. White Lightning. Bryant's pass to Kirtz falls incomplete. Appeared to be some miscommunication, bringing up third down. Porter's run goes for just one. Second-and-9 from the 21. Northwestern gets off the field. Buckle your seatbelts. The record is 226. Todd Sheets (Purdue, 1980) and Jim Lash (MSU, 1972) have it. A tackle for the 'Cats on a Taylor run brings up third-and-5 from the UMN 41. 10 CATCHES. 215 YARDS. TWO TOUCHDOWNS. We're working to see where this ranks in the NU record books but OH MY GOD Bryce Kirtz is HIM. END TWEET. The punt rolls out at the NU 31. Three-and-out for the 'Cats, who aren't out of this yet (pounds on wood) Porter gets in for the score! It's his first rushing TD of the year, and the kick from Olsen makes it a 31-17 game. Porter picks up the first down to set up a first-and-goal from the 4. Lausch gets to the 6-yard line before going down, setting up a third-and-2. Lausch finds Himon for six on a first down from the UMN 14. END OF THIRD: Minnesota 31, Northwestern 10
Honestly, it feels a little closer than the score might indicate, but the Golden Gophers are lighting it up on the ground. Bryant gets hit late on a scamper, moving the ball inside the red zone to end the third quarter. Another first down for Bryant and the 'Cats. He finds Himon on a screen, and NU is now in UMN territory. The score may not show it, but outside of the penalties, this is probably NU's second-best offensive performance of the year. Bryant finds Cam Johnson for 13, and NU is now at midfield. Kirtz with another catch, this time for 12. He's at 141 yards for the day. Taylor breaks a tackle, and scampers in for a 43-yard touchdown. Taylor picks up two to make it a fourth-and-short, and Minnesota goes for it. Taylor's first run of the drive goes for seven, but then Mueller wraps him up for no gain. The defense faces yet another huge third down. Northwestern will punt it away, again. Renner's boot is fair-caught at Minnesota's 48. A big play from Himon wiped out by another penalty!! Kaliakmanis's throw to Jackson is a yard short, and the Golden Gophers will punt it away. Don't look now, but Northwestern could make this a one-score game with a TD... Marshall Lang is doubtful to return, per Northwestern. Taylor loses four yards. Uihlein wraps him up. Porter gains 14 yards, and Jack Olsen nails a field goal from 37 yards out. It's a 24-10 ballgame with 7:29 to go. After losing eight on a sack, Bryant finds Joseph Himon for no gain. Third-and-18 for NU from its own 38. After the play was reviewed: Lausch fumbles on what looked to be a flea flicker(?), but an NU player recovers the ball for a first down. this game is drunk I don't know how else to describe what just happened. All I can say: that, folks, is Big Ten West football at its finest. Bryant finds a wide open Kirtz for 23, as the 'Cats are now in UMN territory with a chance to make this a two-score game. Lausch enters the game, and gets back to the line of scrimmage on second down. Third-and-8 from the NU 40. A nine-yard completion to Kirtz, and an 11-yard run from Porter. First down! Nice defensive stand for the 'Cats. They force a punt after giving up that first completion, and get the ball back at their own 18. KALIAKMANIS INCOMPLETION Kaliakmanis to Daniel Jackson for 16, and the Gophers did not lose any momentum. Second half is off. UMN returns the Northwestern kick to its own 27. Halftime thoughts: Pick the better QB HALF: Minnesota 24, Northwestern 7
Darius Taylor: 21 touches, 155 scrimmage yards, touchdown. In the first half.
Athan Kaliakmanis: 8-for-8, 97 yards, 2 touchdowns Bryant's pass falls incomplete, and Minnesota will get the ball back with 38 seconds to go. Porter's run for what appeared to be a first down is brought back on a Caleb Tiernan hold. Six penalties for 67 yards. Ben Bryant the ball carrier (BBTBC?) for seven. Dragan Kesich nails a 50-yarder (there's actually 1:09 to go, clock got reset). Minnesota leads 24-7. Ok so Athan Kaliakmanis MIGHT be Josh Allen with that hurdle. Wow. It's a fourth-and-8 from the NU 32 with 54 seconds to go. A blown up screen and a run that goes nowhere forces a third-and-15 for Minnesota from the NU 39. David Braun uses his second timeout with 1:24 to go. On cue, Taylor dashes for 41 yards. 17 carries and 139 yards for him.

In the words of Kevin Harlan, ""He just sucked the gravity out of [Ryan Field]!"" Bryant. To Kirtz. 80 yards. TOUCHDOWN. 21-0. The man has completed every pass and has a rating of 284.4. Who are you and what have you done with Athan Kaliakmanis On a third-and-1, Taylor escapes for a 25-yard gain. Gophers are back in the red zone. Taylor breaks free for 18. That's his first run over 10 yards on the night, and Minnesota sets up shop at its own 48. Bryant has to scramble, and can't go anywhere on third down. Renner is back, and his punt goes out of bounds at the Minnesota 28. An unblocked Jack Henderson absolutely demolishes Ben Bryant.

Not so nice flashbacks to the Nick Bosa sack on Daniel Jones on Thursday night, for those of you who watched that. Henning, who's back on the field, picks up seven for the first down. Cam Porter with a really nice block on that run. Lang walks off the field with some assistance, and heads into the tent. Bryant fires to Marshall Lang for 15 yards, but he's down and appears to be hurt. A big play from Porter comes back on a hold. SIGH. Athan Kaliakmanis: 6-for-6, 74 yards, touchdown. The first-year breaks a tackle and plunges his way in. With 8:55 in the second quarter, the Gophers are now up 14-0 (pending Dragan Kesich's extra point). Taylor stuffed by Mac Uihlein. Third-and-goal. A stand would be massive here. Taylor for eight more, and the Gophers are now just three feet away from going up 14. Taylor moves the chains -- first-and-goal for UMN at the 9. I'm sorry but that catch definitely warrants a MAMA THERE GOES THAT MAN because WHAT Gophers convert the third-and-6 with a Kaliakmanis pass to Williams, and enter NU territory. Taylor picks up eight on the run, bringing up second-and-12. Brevyn Spann-Ford gets called for holding on UMN's first play of the drive, bringing up a first-and-20. A.J. Henning appears to be walking to the tent on the sideline. His punt goes to the UMN 32. On third-and-6, Bryant finds Henning for five. He's just short of the line to gain, and Renner will come out again. Student section at the end of the first END OF FIRST: Minnesota 7, Northwestern 0

With the exception of the turnover, NU has hung around thus far. Some key stops on defense for the 'Cats too; Darius Taylor has just 17 yards on six carries. Really nice blocking from the O-line there. Huge hole for Porter, who picks up 11. Porter rushes for gains of six and three. Third-and-1 for NU. Downed by UMN at the 5-yard line. Swing pass to Taylor, but he gets wrapped up by Bryce Gallagher for just one. Gophers set to punt it away, with Henning back to return it. Two Taylor runs go for three and two. Third-and-five from Minnesota's own 45. ""Chris Collins on the coverage"" Three passes, three incompletions, Northwestern will punt it away. Another deep shot to Henning that is JUST out of his reach. On the first play of the drive, Kaliakmanis finds Lemeke Brockington for the TD. Just like that, the Gophers are on the board. Henning fumbles a screen, giving Minnesota possession at the NU 9. Not great! Penalties, cowardly fourth down decisions, Big Ten West football under the lights. We are SO back. Bryant finds Henning for a short gain on an out-route. Pass interference called on NU, moving the ball back 15 yards. Bryant fires another screen toward him for two more yards. Third-and-five from the NU 36. JACK LAUSCH SIGHTING (three-yard run) On a second-and-22 from the 12, Bryant hits Kirtz for a short gain. Another personal foul, this time on Minnesota. That'll give Northwestern a fresh set of downs. Bryant takes a shot downfield for Henning, but just misses him. However, there was some shoving on the sideline -- personal foul on Duke Olges.",440,2023-09-24 00:01:50,2023-09-30 19:50:12
40,"Kirtz on the new Drake album:

""I was defintely streaming it when it came out on Friday."" 

On his favorite song from the album:

""We really felt like wind was going to be a factor today."" It was closer than expected, but Northwestern came out on top. Northwestern staved off a late-game rally by Howard to get back to .500 on the season. FINAL: Northwestern 23, Howard 20 That'll be game. In what never should've been a nail-biter, it took some impressive runs in the final two minutes to secure NU the victory.

The 'Cats advance to a 0.500 record, moving to 3-3 on the year. Woah. 

Tyus runs for a first down, a flag is thrown, then the ref picks up the flag and says there's no holding on the play. Howard attempts the onside kick, and Rod Heard juggles it before corralling it.

NU has the ball on the Howard 43, and if we've learned anything from Braun this quarter, it's that field goals aren't an option unless the 'Cats are inside the HU25. Northwestern led by 16 less than five minutes (of game time) ago.  Howard just scored a touchdown. Wow.

23-20, NU leads with 2:32 to go. No stop was acquired.

First down Howard inside the redzone. 3rd-and-1 incoming for Howard. Obviously four-down territory, but a stop would be great. Williams completes a screen to James on 3rd-and-long, who takes it all the way to the NU 38.

Anxiety  setting in. Williams overthrows his receiver by just a yard or two. Would've been a massive gain for the Bison. So Northwestern punts with about six minutes left to play.

The 'Cats lead by 10, but Howard has shown a little life in the second half. That fourth down call from Braun up 16 with under 10 minutes to go is looking more and more questionable.

In all likelihood, the outcome of the game won't change because of it, but it's still odd. Eden James just ran the ball back for a 64-yard touchdown to open the drive. Wow.

NU leads, 23-13, after a failed two-point attempt from Howard. Andddddd Sullivan is sacked for a big loss, giving Howard the ball at its own 36.

A questionable call there from Braun. Offense is trotting back out.

Braun wants the killshot it seems. On 3rd-and-12, Sullivan scrambles for nine.

Braun kept the offense out there and just called a timeout. Not sure about the logic? Sullivan tries a 35-yard shot to the endzone for Cam Johnson, but it's broken up by a Howard defender. Weird sequence: back-to-back penalties.

The first was on a Howard defender for unsportsmanlike conduct who chucked his mouthpiece  after the last play.

Then a snap infraction by an NU lineman.

Net gain of 10 yards for the 'Cats. Anthony Tyus snags a 12-yard pickup to earn NU a first down. Johnson hauls in a catch that's good for a first down. Gain of two yards on first from Tyus, and Sullivan follows it up with a dart to Johnson for 11. Big pick up by Anthony Tyus is called back on a holding call. 

1st-and-20. This game has me ALIVE AND WELL  (my esteemed colleague  just asked me why I'm tweeting in all-caps in a 16-point game in the fourth quarter...have you ever heard of passion, patrick?) AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH MORE PRESSURE AND THE DEFENSE LAYS OUT WILLIAMS 

'CATS' BALL CLUTCH SACK FROM RICHIE HAGARTY TO FORCE 4TH-AND-FOREVER Time for a Northwestern Redzone Stand Facing pressure while scrambling, Williams lofts a short pass to a receiver in the endzone and puts a little too much oomph on it. 

A close call that now brings up 3rd-and-7. James rushes to the NU 9 for a gain of three. Williams and Ilarranza connect for five, and the Bison get the first down they were looking for. Williams gets it to Ilarranza for six yards, stopping Howard two short of the first — the Bison will go for it. The third quarter ends with a Jarett Hunter 2-yard run.

Heading into the final period, the 'Cats lead by 16 but Howard is driving. Williams and Hawthorne have a miscommunication on first down, as the QB sends a pass to nobody close to the endzone while the WR was near the 20-yard line. Not sure what I just watched.

Eden James looked like he was about to get stuffed and turned it into a zig-zagging 26-yard pickup...*sigh*

Howard now at NU 25. The Bison go with three straight runs with Eden James and get the first down.

Howard is sitting at midfield right now. Touchdown here is almost necessary to stay in this game. Howard picks up a first down to open its drive via a 14-yard pass. Me pulling up to this Brendan Sullivan clinic All I'm saying is that the TD pass came on the first actual play out of the break...#KeepHimOnTheDanceCam That touchdown pass was super impressive — Sullivan on the run, Johnson streaking down the sideline, and the QB puts it right in the bread basket.

NU extends it lead, 23-7. DOT DOT DOT 

SULLIVAN SLINGS ONE TO CAM JOHNSON FOR A HUGE TOUCHDOWN. A THING OF BEAUTY. An Odell-esque catch by Cam Johnson that would've led to a first down will get negated because of an ineligible man downfield.

Sullivan held on to the ball too long there, which led to the flag. Guy in the Purple Pride shirt on the dance-cam right now is electrifying this crowd.

Touchdown incoming. Porter stuffed near the line — gets two. 

Bajakian is definitely leaning into the run game on this drive. Sullivan does it himself and picks up enough for a first down. Porter runs it again, and he picks up one. He's had a tough time finding any open holes today.

3rd-and-2 on Howard's 39. After a 12-man penalty on Howard, Porter takes a run for two yards. SUPER TOUGH CATCH FROM CAM JOHNSON ON THIRD DOWNHe moves the chains! Cam Porter tries his hand now, and he rushes for six.

3rd-and-5 up next. On NU's opening play of the drive, Sullivan hands it off to Himon. He loses 1 — 2nd-and-11 coming up. UPDATE: Student section holding pretty strong given we’re halfway through the 3rd. 

Not sure if a Northwestern score here would keep people around or empower them to head out. Special teams continue to impress. 

Anthony Tyus returns the kickoff for 30 yards, and NU will start its drive at its own 42. Touchdown Howard. 

The Bison use a different QB, Ja'Shawn Scroggins, who rushes it in for six. Not sure if the substitution is due to Williams being hurt from the last play.

16-7, Northwestern. Officials say no targeting. Howard's ball on NU 1. This goal-line stand has been super weird...

After the disconcerting signals penalty, Howard center snapped the ball high. Williams corralled it + tossed it in  vicinity of LOS to avoid incoming sack.

Now the officials are reviewing the play for a potential targeting call. RARE FLAG ALERT: Northwestern gets called for a ""disconcerting signals"" penalty — basically trying to make noise to mess up Howard's snap count.

Gives the Bison an automatic first down. On 3rd-and-7, Williams finds Ilarraza, who darts up to the NU 1.

The original call was a TD, but the officials wiped that off the board. The Bison were also marked half a yard short of the first, so this will be fourth down.

Howard will go for it. Williams takes a shot to the corner of the endzone and perfect coverage by Rod Heard keeps the Bison off the scoreboard (for now). Eden James rushes it for a 3-yard pickup.

Howard is inside the NU ten-yard line. 'Cats defenders collapse the pocket on Williams, but the Howard QB finds an open receiver who squeaks out a first down. 

The Bison are now comfortably in the redzone. On second down, Tony Bedell loses two yards on the run. Here comes 3rd-and-8. Howard runs back-to-back plays up the middle of the Northwestern defense.

The first leads to a first down, and the second results in a 4-yard gain. Williams find his receiver for a short pass, who turns up the sideline and gets nine. James nabs another 2-yard pickup, and the Bison get a new set of downs.

Howard is driving and is nearing the redzone. James rushes for two on second down, which will bring up a 3rd-and-short. Williams finds Ilarraza again, this time for seven. Williams sails one over his receiver's head on first down, but redeems himself with a nice pass to Richie Ilarraza good for 17. Williams finds Kasey Hawthorne for a first down. The WR had a big cushion of open space to make the easy catch. James opens the second half with a 4-yard run for Howard. We're back from the break, and Howard takes the kickoff to their own 26. Me when the press box has actual food Howard’s marching band is on the field right now and has this crowd the loudest it’s been all day. 

This is talent. Howard takes a knee to send it to halftime. 'Cats lead, 16-0.

Pretty cohesive first half from Brendan Sullivan, who is 8-for-11 w/ a rushing and passing TD. The Bison have gotten to Sullivan a LOT today, with tons of pressures and three sacks.

Defense has held up very well too. Student section appears to be at capacity heading into halftime. About as good as you could ask for. With 26 seconds left in the half, Northwestern takes a much needed 16-0 lead.

Aside from the opening drive and safety — both in the first quarter — NU looked like it was stalling out a bit. Sources say Braun saw this tweet and laughed at the idea of running the ball. TOUCHDOWN 'CATS!!!! SULLIVAN TO KIRTZ ON A FOUR-YARD SLANT!! SETTING THE SCENE:

- 31 seconds left in the half
- NU has one timeout left
- the 'Cats are on Howard's four-yard line

Would Braun try running it here, given how good the RBs have been on this drive? Or three straight endzone shots? Clock is dwindling as the half nears, and Sullivan finds Mangieri for five yards and a first down.

Mangieri had great awareness there to extend for the first down — probably got it by a few inches. After Porter gets nothing on first down, the 'Cats try Sullivan's hand. He scrambles for four, bringing up 3rd-and-5. Himon grabs another 10, good for another first down. 

NU now at the Bison's 14. Himon gets 12 on first down, bursting through the middle of the line.

He's so quick in-person. Cam Porter is taking over. 

Another set of back-to-back runs — the most recent one for 11 yards on 3rd-and-5. The pocket collapses on Sullivan on first down and he's able to make it back to the LOS. No gain. Bajakian keeps it in Porter's hands for second and third down. The senior picks up the first. Cam Porter rushes right for eight on first down.

Looked like he ran out of space to turn up the field, but if he could've, that would've gone for a lot. 'Cats grab the first down with a nice six-yard pass to Johnson. On first down, NU picks up eight on the ground — courtesy of Cam Johnson. Eden James tried bouncing out on 4th-and-2 when he might've had a gap if he'd run straight up the middle.

Quinton Williams was yelling at his RB after the play for opting to swing outside.

NU takes over at its own 24. NU GETS THE STOP ON FOURTH DOWN!!!! Theran Johnson comes up with a textbook tackle and stops the Howard pass-catcher just short on third down. Wheeler picks up nothing on first down, and Eden gets four on second.

Now, a big third down awaits. Williams finds a wide open receiver for a hefty pick up on third down.

Howard is driving and finds itself at NU's 28. Braylen Smith jukes multiple NU defenders and probably runs 20 yards laterally to pick up two. 

3rd-and-short up next. On first down, Howard picks up four on the ground. After a review, officials determine Williams' deep pass to Kasey Hawthorne was complete. 

Gain of 21 puts the Bison in NU territory. Never mind...statsheet has been updated to say Howard starts this drive at the 34. I try to add in some color and this is what I get. Howard starts its drive at the 33-yard line after a 40-yarder from Renner.

Fun Fact: between both teams, three drives have started at the 33 today. Popular number. Sullivan completes one to Himon for six yards, but NU needed nine. Here comes the punt team. Correction: Howard made it to the NU 49 and then got called for a false start, pushing itself back into its own territory. Sullivan makes a bad read on the RPO, and he tries to keep it. Gets nowhere. 

Third down on the way. Northwestern takes over from its own 20-yard line, and Sullivan is forced to throw it away on first down. Williams throws an incompletion on third down, and Howard will punt from its own 42. 

The Bison haven't crossed midfield all day. A Bison false start makes it 3rd-and-6. Braun calls a timeout to reset the defense. James runs across the field to turn what looked like a no-gain into a seven-yard pickup.

James trucked two NU defenders, who both had trouble getting up after the play. Williams take a shot on first down and it's just out of reach for the receiver, who wanted a PI.

The NU defender probably got away with a jersey pull there. Howard picks up its second first down of the day thanks to an 11-yard rush from Eden James. NU takes an intentional delay of game to give Renner a chance at pinning the Bison. 

Doesn't seem to work, as Renner boots it 17 yards to the Howard 24. Speaking of...Sullivan takes a sack on third down as he tries to scramble out of the pocket. Three sacks on the day for the Bison. Some Q1 takeaways:

- Sullivan looks mostly comfortable passing, but he's facing pressure consistently from the Howard pass rush
- Defense has been elite, forcing a safety and allowing just one first down
- Special teams... End of the first quarter.

NU leads, 9-0. Just like that, it's third down again. Shows you how fast this offense is moving. SULLIVAN STEPS UP IN THE POCKET AND CONVERTS ON 3rd-AND-17 TO KIRTZ. BIG TIME. False start called on Ben Wrather, 3rd-and-17 incoming.

NU has found itself in some tough third down situations recently. On the replay of second-down, Sullivan scrambles and almost get back to the original LOS. More hurry-up.

'Cats pick up three on first down. Porter gets nowhere on second, but Charlie Mangieri gets called for a holding penalty. Howard's front gets to Sullivan again, this time for a loss of 10. 

An unsportsmanlike penalty on a Bison's defender negates the sack and earns NU a first. Phew. Sullivan tries a pass on first-down, and it's no good. Northwestern is moving faster than my fingers can type.

Back-to-back runs from Cam Porter, which lead to a first down. Northwestern takes over at their own 33 after the punt. Williams sails a deep shot over his receiver, and the Bison's punt team comes on. Williams' pass falls incomplete and was a few inches too high to be intercepted by an NU defender. 

3rd-and-10 on the way. No gain for Wheeler on first down. Howard picks up nine on third down, which is more than enough for a first. Williams passes it short to Wheeler on second down, and the RB fumbles (but recovers). Ball has been on the ground a lot 10 minutes into action. Williams hands it off on first down, and Ian Wheeler picks up two. Student section is still filling in and has about eight more rows to fill. 

Braun will be pleased Renner's punt lands around the Bison's 25-yard line. The returner dropped it, but Howard holds on.

Special teams has been on it today. Pocket collapses FAST on third, and Sullivan is smashed by Howard defenders. NU will punt.

Offense has lost its steam the last two drives after the opening TD. After gaining five on first down, Sullivan loses the progress on an impromptu scramble.

3rd-and-long coming up. An awkward punt-kickoff sequence that included a re-kick ends in NU getting the ball at the 33. 

Braun elected for the re-kick after a penalty on Howard, even though the 'Cats originally would've gotten the ball near midfield. 'CATS GET THE SAFETY.

Pass rush swarms Williams in the endzone, and the Howard QB tries to throw it away but is called for intentional grounding.

9-0, NU! Williams takes it himself and picks up two, forcing a 3rd-and-5. Bison gain three on a run up the middle. Give themselves some breathing room. HUNTER RENNER MASTERCLASS. 

The senior drops it on the Howard three-yard line! Sullivan throws his first incompletion on third down, and Northwestern will punt.

Ironic that the team's first bad sequence comes after being gifted great field position. 'Cats pick up three on second down. 

Third-and-way long coming up. Sullivan botches a handoff to Porter and fumbles. Barely recovers. 

2nd-and-18 on the way. Howard's punter shanks it for a 15-yard boot. 

'Cats will take over at the Bison's 41. Couldn't ask for a better start if you're David Braun. NU comes up with a clutch third-down stop! 

Bryce Gallagher was in coverage on a short pass attempt from Williams. On second down, the Bison are stuffed at the line. Third-and-short coming up. Quinton Williams also nabs a completion on his first attempt of the day. Howard advances seven yards. Howard's returner is gobbled up by Evan Smith.

The Bison will start their first drive from their own 19. Northwestern's first drive in review:

- 75 yards
- 2 minutes, 9 seconds
- Sullivan scrambled twice for 42 yards and a TD + completed both of his pass attempts
- NU picked up three first downs

Not too shabby. TOUCHDOWN 'CATS!

Sullivan scrambles on second down and turns what looked like a short gain into a 35-yard TD. Sullivan is forced out of the pocket and scrambles for seven. Another completion for Sullivan, this time to Bryce Kirtz — moves the chains again. Brendan Sullivan's first pass of the day is a completion to Calvin Johnson II, which he takes for a first down. Howard's kickoff is a short one and puts NU at the 25-yard line to start the game. All you need to know to follow along, as Northwestern takes on Howard. Northwestern will receive the opening kickoff. Chris Collins is in attendance for today’s game. Electric. Editors are on the scene  

(Bradley and Iggy, who???) Every prediction has the ‘Cats scoring over 27 points, which could bode well. Northwestern finds itself in an uncommon role as the favorite against Howard and with an opportunity to move to .500 on the season. You can dominate the nation’s No. 3 team, but you can never beat the NW allegations Northwestern field hockey’s relentless pressure dominated No. 3 Iowa — the country’s best offense — from start to finish in a 2-0 win. FINAL: No. 2 Northwestern 2, No. 3 Iowa 0 
That's 12 in a row. Longest NU win streak since 1990. The NCAA is in big, big trouble. Green card for Greta Hinke, and Iowa will have a one-player advantage the rest of the way. Really great play from Katie Jones to prevent a potential one-on-one for Iowa on the other end. It's been reversed. No goal for Iowa after NU's video referral is successful. 'Cats are still up two. It's not over. Iowa's Annika Herbine strikes it in from way out, and it bounces past Skubisz, but it may have hit a Hawkeye's foot. It's under review.

If it holds, Northwestern would lead 2-1 with 2:33 to go. Some nice stick work from Iowa to get a clean look on Skubisz, but she kicks it away. Under three minutes to play. Wadas' shot is saved. That's 10 corners and 11 shots on goal for NU. 5:40 to play, and it's all but over in Iowa City. Finally, Iowa draws a corner, and she knocks away the Hawkeyes' first two shots on goal of the afternoon. Annabel Skubisz through 51 minutes WADAS JUST DOUBLED THE SCORE! A clean look for her finds the net, and the way this one's going... it could be wraps with 11:30 to play. We're through three. Northwestern leads 1-0.

Through 45 minutes, the Wildcats have held the best offense in the country to:
- 1 shot
- 0 shots on goal
- 0 corners

This is without Maja Zivojnovic, by the way. Wadas gets a green card after tapping the ball following the free hit call. Magnotta stops Lane Herbert's shot. Northwestern is still generating pressure -- and successfully -- even though it's up. This is gonna be Northwestern's eighth(!) corner. Iowa still doesn't have a shot on goal through 39 minutes. A green card on Iowa's Jacey Wittel with about seven minutes left in the third. That's the first for either team. Down one, Iowa is starting to press. The leading offense in the country just cannot get anything going though. NORTHWESTERN GOAL! It's Ilse Tromp off the corner feed from Alia Marshall, and NU is up 1-0! Northwestern immediately works its way into the circle, and will draw another corner. Second half is underway. HALF: NU 0, Iowa 0
Shots on goal: NU 5, Iowa 0
Corners: NU 5, Iowa 0

Only a matter of time. Iowa finally finds its way into the circle, but a really nice play from Skubisz to knock it over the net. That'll wrap up the first half. ANOTHER corner for NU. That's five. Wadas's shot on the second is saved, but the 'Cats maintain possession. NU really dominating possession with its press. Two straight corners for NU, giving them four on the day. Olivia Bent-Cole ALMOST had a goal by taking away a free hit deep in Iowa territory! She can't convert on a one-on-one with Magnotta, though. Tough one. END OF FIRST: No. 2 Northwestern 0, No. 3 Iowa 0
NU got its offense going in the back half of the quarter. 'Cats lead in shots 5-1, and have three shots on goal to Iowa's 0. Olivia Bent-Cole flips the field, has a slick feed to Chloe Relford, but Iowa snuffs it out. Really good look for Northwestern, which now has three shots on goal. Alia Marshall gets two shots off, but Iowa goalie Mia Magnotta saves both. Both relatively contested looks. A ton of action in the midfield right now. No shots on goal through nine minutes, with a few moments of pressure from each team. Ella Kokinis comes in for Halsey with about nine minutes to go in the first. They're off at Iowa! Starting for the 'Cats: Lauren Wadas, Olivia Bent-Cole, Peyton Halsey, Ilse Tromp, Greta Hinke, Chloe Relford, Katie Jones, Lauren Hunter, Alia Marshall, Lindsey Frank, Annabel Skubisz There is a top-three(!!) regular season matchup to start in under five minutes. No. 2  heads to Iowa City to take on the No. 3 Hawkeyes in a rematch of the thrilling 2022 NCAA Quarterfinal.

It’s on BTN. We’ll tweet it + have written coverage at the end. Tune in!  dives into Ben Bryant’s Penn State film. Spoiler alert: he got pummeled. A lot. The Big Ten football schedule structure for the next couple of years dropped yesterday, and there’s a ton to take away for Northwestern. Northwestern men’s basketball made its second-ever NCAA Tournament appearance not even seven months ago. Yet, the Wildcats are looking ahead — not at the past.

“We can talk about it at the reunions when that [2022-23] team comes back,” Chris Collins said. Northwestern golf thrived last weekend across the board. On the sixth episode of Pound the Talk, ,  and  talk about what they want to see from Northwestern against Howard in a more favorable homecoming matchup. Northwestern basketball is varying its look in advance of a must-see 2023-24 season, and keeping some fan-favorites. Content that  would be proud of. Another All-American on this loaded of a team might just be unfair. Pat Fitzgerald has filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against Northwestern after he was fired in July over accusations of hazing inside the football program.

Fitzgerald, who had $42 million left on his contract, was fired for cause. If you haven't learned already, news comes in tidal waves around here...

No USC or UCLA here. NU will go to Washington, though. That's Michigan, Ohio State and the Huskies in one year. Yeesh. This thread also contains the 2025 through 2028 schedule formats as well. Collins said his dream basketball venue is Augusta National Golf Course, by the way. Collins on what he's excited about most: ""All you really want is, can you get the best out of the guys you have? Can you become the best that that team is able to become? That's kind of what's fun for me in coaching. Can we put the best team together?"" More: ""You just hope that you have a strong base of leaders. You need a little luck, too."" Collins on if he saw last year coming: ""I think you notice those qualities. I don't think people realize how hard winning is at this level. There's a lot of good players everywhere. I don't think you can say, 'Man, we're gonna win.'""

Noted competitiveness as a good indicator. ""You have to adjust and be flexible to the times. College basketball is not what it was 20 years ago. There's things we might not like as coaches at times, but we have to adjust. You have to try to stay true to your standards and your morals...but also be on the cutting-edge."" Collins on recruiting: ""We've been faced now with a number of rule changes. The NIL piece has been great for the student-athletes. We're all in support of that. When you add the element of the instant one-time transfer rule, it's made answering questions a little bit different."" Collins on his transfer additions: ""We have three graduate students. Everyone else has class,"" he joked.

Said they're ""really excited"" about Ryan Langborg and Blake Preston, who bring ""winning qualities.""

""Winning is really hard."" Collins: ""With each year...it doesn't make it the same. Everybody who's coming back is different. You're adding new personalities, new roles. You've got to start over. I think that's the biggest thing that all winning programs do. You can't take those things for granted."" Collins on last year's experience: ""I think last year was a lot of fun for all of us. To see a group of guys rally together, and not accept that to be the reality. They were a tough group. They got confidence along the way. You can't put a price on chemistry."" Chris Collins now at the podium with other Chicago MBB coaches. McKeown on realignment: ""You just through it. You just kind of take what's next. Just put your head down and grind.""

Referenced the additions of Maryland and Rutgers in 2014. McKeown shouts out Chris Collins' dance moves for the dance moves at his daughter's wedding.

Now, we need to see McKeown's moves! McKeown called the trip to Spain a ""great experience.""

Called Crystal Wang a ""great player"" and said Caroline Lau is a ""great point guard.""

""I just think we're going to be a lot better, a lot more poised. It was great for us."" McKeown said he and NU have been ""lucky"" to not really have to use the transfer portal.

""We've been able to develop the Veronica Burtons to a first-round pick. I think the player development for us is really important. We like what we're doing.""

Praised Tangela Smith's work. Joe McKeown on what he took from last year: ""Not much. It's my 40th year as a head coach. I think we've only had two losing seasons. They stick. We have a chip on our shoulder.""

Said he was ""encouraged"" by late-season play and the young talent on the team. Boo Buie and Ryan Langborg, noted TikTok sensations A weekend of highs and lows, but full of resilience: Here at the Chicagoland Media Tipoff, where Northwestern men's and women's basketball coaches and players will be making appearances. Stay tuned for updates! As some ex-Cats make their way back from injuries, other former NU players are stepping up: A loss that inspires? NUFB might be on the come up: Inside NU spoke with Northwestern AD Derrick Gragg, marking his fourth interview since July 7 — the first with student media.

Below are Gragg’s comments on decisions he made this summer, David Braun, renovating The J, the new ticket system and much more. Abandon all hope, ye Michigan teams who enter here. Following a win against Minnesota and a better-than-expected performance against Penn State, here’s how Northwestern can move to .500 on Saturday. Thank goodness divisions are gone after this season. Ahead of this weekend’s homecoming matchup, Northwestern’s interim head coach David Braun met with the media on Monday afternoon. How often does a seventh-place Big Ten team get one of the best recruiting classes in the entire conference? On Penn State's fake kneel play near the end of the fourth quarter: ""Great scheme, great execution by them. I'll never take exception to that. At the end of the day, we're there to compete."" Braun said he anticipates cornerback Theran Johnson to be back against Howard on Saturday. Braun on limiting Howard's offense: ""They find ways to use tempo to their advantage. They're balanced, they do a nice job up front. You turn on that Eastern Michigan film, and there's some explosive plays in the pass game. 

""When they put the pedal down, they can get you reeling Braun on his film-watching approach: ""You find balance. You tip your hat to a well-rounded team, but you need to be solution-focused.

""Great coaching is identifying what our guys can do consistently while evaluating how we can improve."" He also said that the opportunity for Northwestern to play an HBCU is ""historic."" Braun on the Howard marching band: ""I think it's awesome. College football at its best. You talk about the student experience, fans and alumni... it's incredible. 

""To see what college athletics can do for the experience of a young person, I think it's awesome."" Braun on what he sees for the trajectory of the team: ""We've talked about how we're in the third game of our second quarter, well-timed bye right at halftime. We go 1-0 this week, we go into halftime 3-3, and we have the goals this group is striving for right in front of us."" Braun on concerns with the rushing attack: ""I think it ties back into balanced attack, complementary football, playing with a lead.

""When we can find ways to control the clock, run the football, Coach Bajakian has the entire playsheet available, we play our brand of football."" On rotating kickoff roles: ""Part of it is who's got the hot foot. Part of it is splitting the load. Location of where we're putting the ball. 

""With some of the explosive qualities that Penn St. possessed on special teams, we thought Luke [Akers] would be a weapon on kickoffs."" Braun on Carmine Bastone: ""He embodies so many of the qualities that make Northwestern great. Toughness, academic excellence, perseverance, great teammate.

""I think it speaks to what we want to continue to build here. We want to bring and recruit high-character young men."" Braun on Sullivan and the QB room: ""The interception and the throw is a choice he'd like to have back. But unequivocally, I've spoken to the quality of that room. The depth and the leadership that exists with Brendan, what Ryan Hilinski and Jack Lausch bring."" Braun on whether he's reflected: ""An opportunity to reflect? No, probably not. But there is a great deal of gratitude from both Kristin and I for the support. For our players, for the people we're doing this with. Pretty neat.""

Said they felt tangible support from NUFB alums. On Howard: ""I promise you in these walls there's no mention of FCS about our opponent. Our guys will be ready to go."" Braun on maintaining focus against Howard: ""I challenged the group after Minnesota, an emotional high's hard to come off sometimes. I thought they did a good job.

""Now they're coming off an emotional low."" Braun on whether there's a Ben Bryant's injury update: ""Not specifically. That dude is tough, he'll do everything in his power back to full health.""  

If Bryant were not able to play, Braun noted that he would expect Brendan Sullivan to be the starter. Braun: ""There are people that'll pat you on the back to say, 'Hey, great first half,' but we prepared to win a football game."" Braun: ""There's plenty of positives to pull from, but at the end of the day our guys expected victory, expected to beat Penn State.""

Talked about Braun's mentality of celebrating small victories and physicality.

""It makes the offense think a little bit more."" Azema on special teams: ""Guys embracing their role. At the end of the day, that's a third of the game. Guys don't bat an eye. I love it. Why not start the game off? Why not be on special teams?"" Azema on the defense keeping high spirits despite the offense's struggles: ""At the end of the day, it's a simple game: if the other team doesn't score, we win. We have to go look in the mirror, and go back to the drawing board."" Azema on tackling Heinrich Haarberg: ""Shoutout Cole Freeman. He's out scout team quarterback right now. He's running the option the whole week for us. He prepared us definitely for it."" Azema on defensive improvement: ""I think the physicality. We came out and set the tone. It's a big emphasis: not letting the offense fall forward."" Azema on Devin Turner: ""Devin acts like a coach's kid. Devin loves the game of football. He puts the preparation. At the end of the day, he should have about five picks right now. He's always in the right spot."" Azema on the safety group's performance: ""We're the heartbeat of the team. We have great depth in the room, we rotate guys, and we know that everyone can make a play.""

Added that ""we've got to keep the pedal down."" Coco Azema now speaking. Kirtz on the locker room mood: ""The mood is not high, obviously. We didn't come here to lose. Guys aren't too happy about the way things went.""

Noted Braun's 24-hour rule of flushing results. Kirtz on not capitalizing on his 66-yard catch: ""It's definitely frustrating. You definitely want to capitalize off a big, explosive play like that. It takes the momentum away, almost. It's hard to bounce back from that."" Kirtz on his confidence in Brendan Sullivan: ""He's definitely poised. Every time he steps on the field, he wants to score. You love to see that, because in an away game, it's hard."" Kirtz on drives stopping short: ""Really just in practice, we've just got to prepare better. Self-inflicted wounds is no way to go about a game."" Kirtz on the offense: ""Our focus point was playing physical, starting fast. I just felt like we weren't physical enough.""

Called the sack number ""unacceptable."" Bryce Kirtz now at the podium. Braun on Ben Bryant: ""We do expect to get Ben back at some point.""

Said that he didn't have a specific update or timetable. Added that it's ""hard to say"" if he'll be ready for Maryland. Braun on road struggles: ""We had a focused a team. A team in the locker room that was ready to roll. I thought our group did a great job of handling this environment. They stared that thing down. If we can continue to have that approach on the road, the wins will come."" Braun on run defense: ""It'll be interesting to go back and watch the film. Overall, I thought that group battled their tail off. Eleven guys swarming.""

Said the defense played with ""edge"" and ""urgency."" Braun on Hunter Renner: ""Awesome. Really proud of our kicking game and how we executed."" Braun on Richie Hagarty not making the trip: ""We were really hopeful that he would. Sometimes those injuries, there's an ebb and flow. As we got later in the week, we knew we weren't gonna make it happen, but optimistic we'll make it happen for Maryland."" Braun on Devin Turner: ""It's just him honing into his process. That's a young man that continues to grow, continues to improve."" Braun on Brendan Sullivan's play: ""There wasn't a consideration [in making a change]. I'm proud of Sully."" Braun on offensive line play: ""The O-Line plays a critical piece in that. So do the 'backs. So do the wide receivers. So does the quarterback.""

Said there are ""so many pieces"" and that ""it's everyone that plays into that."" Braun on not capitalizing on Heard's pick: ""In hindsight, it's huge. We're going to continue to harp on it. We've got to find ways to turn that into seven points."" Braun called Sullivan's interception ""inconsequential."" Braun on the decision-making to end the first half: ""There were some opportunities at the end of the half, where we could've called some timeouts to give ourselves more time. I didn't feel like it was the time to give them more time to process offensively."" Braun on tight end penalties: ""We've got to continue to evaluate it. You've got to get your hands inside.""

Said there's holding on ""every single play"" but that the team has to have  a ""feet-first mentality"" for blocking outside. Braun: ""We've got to continue to find ways to stay efficient, and to stay ahead of the sticks. Especially in the red zone when those gains were stalling out, going negative."" Braun: ""This group is up to the challenge. We've found a way to win three games up to this point. We should expect to have an opportunity."" Braun: ""Proud of our effort. Certainly not satisfied with the result. Disappointed with the result."" Braun in his opening statement: ""You have a locker room in there right now that is crushed. This team, this program, came into Lincoln today expecting to win a football game. We challenged them to play for four quarters.""

Said the team ""played their tails off."" David Braun will speak to the media shortly. It was an up-and-down game for Northwestern in more ways than one. The Wildcats remain winless away from Ryan Field. FINAL: Nebraska 17, Northwestern 9

An ugly affair by both sides ends in favor of the home team. Eight sacks and a very slow start from Brendan Sullivan doomed a strong defensive effort, including two takeaways.

The Wildcats drop to 3-4 and 1-3 in conference play. Nebraska takes a knee, and Braun doesn't call a timeout. This one is over. With the game on the line, Sullivan is crushed. Immediate pressure up the middle ruined the play.

That'll do it from Lincoln. Sullivan rolls left and is nearly picked by Phalen Sanford. This will be the game on fourth-and-17. Matt Rhule uses his first timeout of the half with 1:33 left. Sullivan is flushed from the pocket and chucks one deep to nobody. It's now third-and-16; would have to think NU needs at least eight. Sullivan is sacked by Gifford, marking the seventh (!) sack of the day. Moves NU to second-and-16. Killer. Sullivan threads the needle to Kirtz for a pickup of 13. Wildcats going quickly. Sullivan races for a gain of 10 on a scramble. Henning makes a fair catch at his 13. The Wildcats will have 2:59 to drive down the field, score and convert a two-point conversion. Haarberg takes off and runs on third but is met in the hole by Gallagher. Second timeout utilized by Braun.

UNL will punt with 3:06 remaining. Johnson runs again for three, and Braun utilizes his first timeout left with 3:12 to go.

Will be third-and-4 following this stoppage. Emmett Johnson pushes forward for three yards. Inside of four minutes left. Haarberg goes off tackle on zone read for a gain of 16. Another big run for No. 10 in red. A hold on the Huskers puts the ball at the UNL 24 with 4:39 to go. Northwestern still down by eight.

That last drive may prove to be a killer. Sullivan is flushed with pressure and eventually brought down by James Williams. Renner punts with under five minutes left. Porter is short of the sticks on third down, and a facemask on Thomas Gordon makes it now third-and-18. Cataclysmic. Johnson digs out a slant to establish third-and-3. Porter works east-west but loses two. Under seven minutes left. Working against the blitz, Sullivan buys time and finds Cam Johnson open for a first down. Huge conversion, and a pickup of 14. Lenhardt totally stuffs a Henning jet sweep. Loss of four, creating third-and-9. Sullivan links up with Henning on a tunnel screen to get five. Henning makes a fair catch at the 12. Northwestern trails by eight with 8:39 left. Gallagher locks down Fidone II on third down. Great play by the captain to get NU the ball back. Haarberg throws across his body to Fidone II to net three. It's a crucial third-and-5 coming up for the Huskers. Grant picks up three, but more clock ticks off. Under 10 minutes to go. Emmett Johnson rips off a 10-yard run following a whiff from Gallagher. From the 25, Haarberg runs for five. Olsen nails it. It's 17-9 Huskers with 11:09 left. Sullivan throws to Marshall Lang in the flat, but he's dropped by Malcolm Hartzog. Olsen will kick from 25. Sullivan runs for a loss of two. A NU tight end was left alone to the right side.

Third-and-goal. Tyus gets the ball and gets four. NU at the UNL 5 after previously being at the 9. Sullivan evades a corner blitz and drops one right in the bucket to Kirtz! Gain of 66 yards.

Northwestern at the UNL 5. Touchdown is needed here. Sullivan and Kirtz are off again on first, missing on a slant. A.J. Henning returns the kick to NU's 25.

The ""Halloween"" theme music is playing. Michael Myers may be lurking for NU's offense. Touchdown, Nebraska. Haarberg finds Malachi Coleman wide open on a post after play action. Devin Turner was the nearest defender.

17-6 Huskers. That may be insurmountable. Nebraska will start at the Northwestern 44 after a 38-yard punt by Renner. 14:10 to go in this one, and the Wildcat defense will need to hold strong yet again. Sullivan is sacked on third down by Jimari Butler. That's the fourth time the NU QB has been taken down. False start called on Caleb Tiernan will make this third-and-eight. Another crucial mistake. End of the third quarter: Nebraska 10, Northwestern 6

Neither team has over 180 yards, and there's been just one touchdown scored. Prime sicko football. Isaac Gifford goes low to stop Porter, setting up third-and-3. Himon bounces a run outside for four. Nearly a major loss. After an excellent punt, Henning drops it and is then met immediately by a Cornhusker. Near back-breaking issue. Wildcats will begin at their own 10. Azema helps stop Haarberg on a zone read, and Buschini punts. Gallagher cleans up a jet sweep to set up third-and-6. Grant is met quickly along the right side, picking up one. The Huskers have 29 carries for 145 yards, good for 4.5 on average. Johnson immediately fixes UNL's field position issues. He slices through multiple tackles for a gain of 24. Hunter Renner is having a day. Nice bounding ball that rolled out at the Nebraska 5. Sullivan escapes for five but is met by a pair of Cornhuskers. Renner will punt again. Sullivan off again trying to find Kirtz. Far too much air under that one.

Brings up third-and-10. NU stays through the air, but Sullivan overthrows Kirtz. Sullivan throws a strike to Bryce Kirtz over the middle for a 17-yard gain. A toss to Himon is destroyed by Cameron Lenhardt. Loss of three. Henning narrowly misses getting hit by the punt, but the Huskers down it at the NU 35. Sean McLaughlin I knocks down Haarberg's third-down pass, and Buschini will punt. Theran Johnson swats away a deep pass on second down, which makes it third-and-10. Haarberg misses an open Alex Bullock on a PA Boot. That type of day for both offenses. . reacting to another backside blocking mistake from a Northwestern tight end Olsen's kick is short. Nebraska will begin at its own 36.

It's Olsen's first miss of the year. 

(We apologize for the jinx) Sullivan is forced to throw away on third down, and Jack Olsen will try from 54 (!) Lausch scampers for a loss of two on a trick play pass. Northwestern can't do much of anything on offense. Jack Lausch, under center, spins for two to bring up second-and-23. An illegal block by Thomas Gordon moves the Wildcats back to the Nebraska 37. Another self-inflicted mistake. Sullivan looks deep and finds A.J. Henning, who adjusts to the underthrown ball for a gain of 32! Northwestern at the UNL 22.

Haarberg looks deep for Jaidyn Doss, but Garnett Hollis Jr. was in strong position. UNL will punt. Haarberg drops the snap, but picks it up.

This game, man. Haarberg is stopped after a gain of one on first. Haarberg chugs along the right side and moves the sticks. The Nebraska QB has 52 rushing yards. Fidone II finds space in Northwestern's zone, picking up 10 and setting up third-and-6. Joshua Fleeks drops the snap but falls on it. Loss of six for Nebraska. Renner, back in the game at punter, sends one away for 51 yards. No. 99 has had a great day so far. Against the blitz, Sullivan finds Porter on a hot, but Nick Heinrich fought through multiple blockers for the stop. Johnson drops a good throw from Sullivan.

Third-and-10 forthcoming. A false start erases the first-down gain. Sullivan finds Cam Johnson for the receiver's first catch of the day. Gain of five. Nebraska kicks for a touchback, so the Wildcats will start at their own 25. DL Brendan Flakes is OUT for the rest of today's game with a lower body injury, per Northwestern Athletics.

The two quarterbacks have combined to go 6-for-14 passing for 34 yards and three interceptions.

The Wildcats have gained only 96 total yards and squandered excellent field position twice.

Was a very zany first half, to say the least. Sullivan is intercepted on a deep shot to Thomas Gordon, and that'll take us into the break. Sullivan checks it down to Himon, who gets seven. With four seconds remaining, Northwestern calls another TO. Himon picks up nothing on second, and David Braun uses his first timeout.

A bit of an interesting decision with 10 seconds left. With 23 seconds left, Joseph Himon II accumulates nine. Only 16 seconds left with NU at the 34. Call stands despite a close play. Good hit by Ore Adeyi, but to no avail. Haarberg flips in along the left side for the touchdown, making it 10-6 Cornhuskers.

Only 23 ticks left in the first half. Johnson picks his spots for seven on first down. Haarberg keeps on the option for 20 yards, but Azema lays the boom.

Tommi Hill puts UNL at its own 23 after a short return. Jack Olsen makes the kick. 6-3 Wildcats.

The NU kicker this year: Will Halkyard called for a false start, so make it from 37. Sullivan runs power on third down but is stopped after another trip by Umanmielen. Jack Olsen will try from 32. Tyus loses two and is swarmed by red shirts. Third-and-10 upcoming. Porter drives his legs for a first down. Northwestern in the red zone. Sullivan keeps it off a fake to Henning for six. It's been the Tyus show! He makes a jump cut and rumbles for 39 before being caught from behind. NU on the UNL 31. Tyus roars for 15 after a terrific block on the edge.

NU's first first down of the game. Tyus gets the rock again and picks up five. Third-and-3 at Northwestern's 15. Anthony Tyus III gets just two on first down. Today's attendance: 86,769 in Lincoln.

Third-and-10 upcoming. With nobody open, Sullivan runs for five, bringing up third-and-5. Hesitated a bit before cutting upfield. Princewill Umanmielen destroys a Porter run for a loss of two. Hands to the face is called on Nebraska, moving NU to the 40. Henning's return is for 15 yards. Wildcats start at their own 24. The last time the Big Ten West played a normal game Tristan Alvano nails one from 47, and the fireworks fly from Lincoln.

Jack Lausch runs a QB power to the left side but is swallowed up immediately. Northwestern only moving backward. Henning takes a jet sweep to the left, but Marshall Lang is called for holding.

Wildcats at the Huskers' 13.

WHAT IS GOING ON On first down, the Cornhuskers lose the ball after a bone-crushing hit by Devin Turner and Bryce Gallagher, but it's picked up.

Only a loss of three. Renner's second punt is fair caught at the Nebraska 13. On third down, Sullivan rolls out right but is stuffed well short of the sticks.

The Wildcats have gained -2 yards on two possessions, both of which have started inside the Nebraska 45. Sullivan looks deep to Henning on a slot fade, but the QB overshoots him.

This game is on absolute crack right now. On third down, Sullivan is sacked by Nash Hutmacher.

A promising start is dissolved instantly. Sullivan's second pass is nearly intercepted. Was intended for Kirtz.

Third-and-12 already. Now, Brendan Sullivan drops the snap on the first play, losing two. Near disaster. On the first play from scrimmage, Heinrich Haarberg is INTERCEPTED by Devin Turner!

But, a pretty devastating blow to Northwestern's offense without QB1. Northwestern mustered a late push, but ultimately, it wasn’t enough as it falls to Michigan State 2-1.

After zero defeats in 12 to start the year, the ‘Cats have now lost in back-to-back games.

Not what they needed while seeking a Big Ten regular season title. Northwestern comes so close to the equalizer after Thaggard stood up a cross from the byline following an authoritative run down the right.

Seems like 11 a.m. on Hallowweekend was not the ideal start time for students Today’s QB1 As the ‘Cats and Terps begin pregame warmups, here is everything you need to know about today’s Big Ten clash. Our staff predicts some Halloween spooks for the Wildcats. Not surprising based on the tenor of David Braun's quotes this week.

A bit of a full circle moment for Sullivan, who notched his first career start against the Terps in College Park last year. Side note, this will mark the third straight home game where NU has worn a black uniform (Penn State, Howard, Maryland) The Wildcats haven't won wearing the Gothics since beating Illinois in 2020.

They'll look to snap the skid tomorrow against Maryland. As Northwestern prepares to take on Maryland tomorrow, Inside NU spoke with WMUC’s  to learn about the Terps.

Another year of Paige Mott starting could mean another big offensive jump. A key starter on one of the country’s best high school basketball teams, Crystal Wang’s versatility could open up a world of possibilities for Northwestern. A casual 16-game win streak for the No. 1 team in the country, which now has its first outright conference title since 1994.

Light work for Tracey Fuchs' squad. In his second straight start, Sullivan flashed his talent but could not play consistently enough to lead Northwestern to victory. As Northwestern contends for sole control of the regular-season Big Ten title, the Wildcats focus on the now rather than what’s ahead. Northwestern’s defense will need to solve a major challenge if the Wildcats want to prevail over Maryland. The 6-foot-4 transfer guard should make an impact from the get-go. Northwestern women’s soccer’s season seems like it came to a bitter end after narrowly missing the cusp of the Big Ten Tournament. As Northwestern begins its season, the ‘Cats brought in transfer Maggie Pina from Boston University to up their scoring prowess.

As Northwestern claimed its first Big Ten regular season title since 2013 over the weekend, the ‘Cats showed why they are the No. 1 team.

To clarify, Braun was asked about NU wearing black (and not purple) for three straight home games, including this upcoming weekend against Maryland. To clarify, Braun was asked about NU wearing black (and not purple) for three straight home games, including this upcoming weekend against Maryland. That ends today's presser. Braun on the remaining goals: ""The goal moving forward is finding a way to beat Maryland. All of our efforts and energy have to go into getting a win back at Ryan Field, which is an opportunity we're really excited about."" Braun on experience on defense: ""It's a credit to our players. It's a credit to that defensive staff. Unique circumstances.""

Said that players have earnestly asked him how he's doing, which only motivates him as a coach further.

Called Coco Azema's tape ""energizing."" Braun on team resilience: ""It's just the character of the group. We all know this is a unique season for a lot of different reasons. I think you've got a group that steps back in the facility, owns the previous week and attacks the next opportunity."" Braun on Cam Porter: ""I had the opportunity to visit with Cam a couple of times. He is the ultimate team player. Embodies selflessness. At the end of the day, would Cam like to touch the ball 30 times a game? Absolutely. Cam is always going to put the team first."" Braun on Brendan Sullivan: ""He's continued to get better and better each week. I see a young man that battles. That's all you can ask out of your quarterback."" Braun on better tight end blocking: ""The conversation is about eliminating gray.""

Noted that the pre-snap movement altered how the block was executed.

Said that the team will take ""extreme ownership"" about its own mistakes and won't blame officials. Braun on uniforms: ""That is a question that I don't feel positioned to answer right now.""

Said he would want to spend more time aggregating information (largely via time in the program) before weighing in). Braun on the Wildcats' secondary: ""I think you see a group that's continuing to find more and more confidence. Finding a certain rhythm with one another. I think you find a group that is responding to some challenges that we've put in front of them."" Braun on deciding carries/touches: ""I'm not mandating who's in, who's out. I trust our offensive staff to make in-game decisions as they continue to manage our offense."" On in-game conversations: ""At the end of the day, considering the context of the situation and the way all of this happened, I was never going to be a micro-manager of the offense. In-game, it's more strategy, time management, things that I'm seeing."" Particularly stressed keeping the ball ahead of the sticks.

""Those are things that Mike and I have had conversations about. We're taking active steps to ensure that those areas improve."" Braun on talking to Mike Bajakian: ""Those conversations happen weekly. There's not a single person in this facility that doesn't want to see that area of our offensive operation continue to improve. As you evaluate those scenarios, we certainly have to execute."" Braun said that he did re-watch the game against Maryland last year in College Park.

""They do a good job of mixing inside zone, outside zone, some gap scheme. Enough element of quarterback run game that keeps you honest."" Braun on preparing for Maryland's offense: ""They're really good. Well-structured run game. A bunch of juniors and seniors up front. A very deep, talented wide receiver room. A quarterback that operates at an extremely high level."" Braun on offensive play: ""I thought Sully battled his tail off, and found ways to create some plays. We've got to do a better job of protecting Sully."" Braun added that ""nothing's changed"" since the early outlook, which seemed more promising.

""We're going to stay optimistic from our rehab approach."" Braun said there's no update on Ben Bryant:

""We're very confident that Ben will be back at some point this season.""

Called it a ""fickle deal"" in terms of his injury, with day-to-day operation.

""He's hungry to get back."" Braun on starting Jackson Carsello at center: ""We'll evaluate that day-to-day. Jackson had a great two weeks of practice."" Braun on special teams: ""The way that those guys performed in terms of being able to create advantageous field position, Jack [Olsen] being able to get us on the board, Will [Halkyard] from a snapping standpoint. Probably something that we could point out every single week."" Braun on the same mistakes: ""There's been elements in terms of our protection that have been clicking, for sure.""

Said the team has to get better at dealing with pressure looks.

Noted that there have been ""bright spots"" in terms of pass rush. Called OL/DL ""points of emphasis."" Braun said that the team is ""amped up"" and ""ready to grow from"" the loss to Nebraska. Braun on team morale: ""It [the mood] is different [than other games]. I think you have a football team right now that has started to really find their confidence, their identity.""

Noted that the team ""left every ounce of their being out on that field."" Braun called the team ""intense"" and said that it knows its best football is ahead of it. David Braun's opening statement: ""Back in the facility yesterday. Our guys were back at it this morning for morning meetings. Did not get any easier yesterday, going back and reviewing the film. You have a group that is disappointed in the result, but also very hungry."" David Braun set to speak to the media shortly from the Walter Athletics Center Team Auditorium. Stay tuned for updates!

Braun: ""Really disappointed with the result. Deeply wanted to see this team come out of Wrigley with a win. Many reasons for that, but I think you saw a team that embodied what team really looks like.

""A group that just tried to get it done through thick and thin."" Braun now at the podium. Society flashed back to 1950s football with today’s outcome. Postgame presser to start shortly. David Braun will be up first. An ugly one that probably won’t be forgotten anytime soon. FINAL: Iowa 10, Northwestern 7

A last-second field goal from Drew Stevens lifts Iowa to a crucial Big Ten West win in a hideous offensive affair.

Crucial missed opportunity for NU, which tied the game late. Northwestern fumbles, and that's game. Iowa uses its last timeout with one second left. Sullivan took mightily long on second down, but threw it away with one second left.

Northwestern will need a miracle. Sullivan connects with Kirtz. Northwestern has a first down, and the clock is stopped with six seconds left on a spike.

Ball at the Northwestern 42. Stevens' kick is a touchback. Ferentz utilizes his second timeout before the kick.

Wouldn't be surprised to see Iowa squib this. Stevens drills it from 53.

Northwestern will have 14 seconds left and one timeout to try to muster a comeback. On third-and-7, Iowa hands it to Williams, who looks like he got nothing. Kenny Soares II in on the stop.

Second TO used by Braun with 19 seconds left. This will come down to a 53-yard kick from Drew Stevens, who's 0-for-1 on the day. Williams stutters for a gain of two. Iowa at the Northwestern 35 with 24 seconds left.

David Braun burns his first timeout. Williams gets one yard on first down. Iowa calls a timeout with the ball at the Northwestern 37 and 29 seconds to go. Hill drops back and finds Cael Vanderbush wide open on a corner route. A huge pickup for the Hawkeyes, who are down to the Northwestern 38. Williams muscles his way for a first down. Iowa at its own 39. A screen to Ragaini picks up eight yards. Several missed tackles on that one. A short kick is fielded by Iowa. The Hawkeyes will start at their own 28. More turf work, because of course. Northwestern finally scored from inside the 5-yard line On third-and-4 from the 5-yard line, Sullivan finds Cam Johnson for a touchdown!!!

Jack Olsen's kick is good. We're all tied from Wrigley!! Mike Bajakian runs a QB Power, but Sullivan is swarmed along the edge by DeJean.

A questionable call to say the least. Sullivan runs up the middle and is tripped up at the Iowa 4! Under 3 minutes left. Suddenly, this game has become riveting. Sullivan bails from the pocket and finds Kirtz, who narrowly picks up a first down! Wildcats at the Iowa 11. Tyus is met immediately by Deontae Craig. Third-and-5 upcoming. Have to figure this is two-down territory. Tyus totes the rock for a gain of four yards. We're inside of 5 minutes remaining. A short kick by Taylor is returned by Henning all the way to the Iowa 22! What a play by the All-Big Ten returner. Best wishes to Beau Stephens, who left the game on a cart. On third-and-8, Williams runs with a head of steam but is two yards shy. Hawkeyes will punt. Hill is pushed again and nets two yards.

Another stoppage to fix the field at this end. Play has resumed.

Second-and-10 with 6:19 left. Ball at the Iowa 1. We now have a stoppage to tamp down the field.

Sure, why not A very valid point Hill sneaks for a gain of maybe a half-yard. Paramount drive coming up for Northwestern's defense, with Iowa starting inside of its own 1-yard line.

6:36 to go in this one. 7-0 Hawkeyes. Sullivan is stopped short of the goal line.

Tremendous stand by the Iowa defense. That very well may do it. Castro makes an enormous tackle on Porter, and it's now fourth-and-1.

Unbelievable how this is turning out. Sullivan gets pushed from behind by Gordon, a la the Tush Push, but Nick Jackson stops him before he could break the plane. It's now third-and-1 from the 1.

""Let's Go Hawks"" chants raining down. Porter is knocked down at the 1. 8:30 to go. Sullivan looks to Kirtz in the end zone, and DeJean is assessed for pass interference!

Northwestern has the ball at the 2. Oh my goodness. Sullivan keeps it but is met by a pair of Hawkeyes. NU down to the Iowa 12. Sullivan flips to Tyus, who has enough for the first down! Northwestern is at the Iowa 13 with under 10 minutes. On third, Tyus is marked short. Sets up fourth-and-1, and the Northwestern offense is staying on the field. Biggest play of the afternoon. Terrific catch by Johnson along the sideline to keep his knee in. A 13-yard pitch and catch, setting up third-and-4. Sullivan hangs in the pocket and finds Porter in the flat, who's brought down by Sebastian Castro. But, holding by Josh Priebe moves the ball back.

Another killer penalty. On first down, Iowa swarms Porter. We're under 12 minutes to go in this game. Porter hits the hole and moves the first down. 'Cats at the Iowa 25 after strong running. Tyus gets eight on second down. Quinn Schulte forces a third-and-2 from the Iowa 31.

Have to wonder if this is a go-for-it spot. Sullivan escapes pressure from multiple spots and slides down after picking up no yards. Tyus slithers through multiple tackles, stretching the run outside for a crucial first down. Ball goes back to Lausch, who angles up the near side for three. Third-and-4 Northwestern from the Iowa 48. Jack Lausch keeps the ball for a gain of three. End of the third quarter: Iowa 7, Northwestern 0

The difference so far is just the Addison Ostrenga touchdown after a blocked Hunter Renner punt.

Can the Wildcats, who have 70 total yards through three quarters, muster enough to even get on the board? Tyus lowers his shoulder for a first down. That's Northwestern's fifth first down of the day. Sullivan finds Bryce Kirtz for a nine-yard completion. Sets up third-and-1 after a good tackle by Jermari Harris. Thomas Gordon drops a pass on first down. The student completing the crossbar challenge has been just as effective as these two quarterbacks today, fwiw Bad bounce for Taylor, as the ball checks up at the Northwestern 33. Northwestern's defense gets off the field on third down, and Taylor will punt for the fifth time from Wrigley. Williams gets it in his belly again, but Gallagher tackles him. It's third-and-16 Hawkeyes. Hubbard flies in on first down to cut off the Iowa run. Strong two games for No. 91. Holding on Tyler Elsbury pushes the ball back to the Iowa 31, and sets up first-and-20 Hawkeyes. On third down, Williams gets past the sticks for a first down. Seventeen carries and 61 yards for No. 4 in white. Hill narrowly escapes rush from Kenny Soares III, throwing it in the air. It was *nearly* intercepted by Rod Heard II, but somehow fell down.

Emblematic of this game. Williams keeps his legs churning along the left side for a gain of seven. Renner's punt bounces into the end zone. Poor special teams coverage on the back end. David Braun makes a conservative call and sends Hunter Renner out there on fourth-and-4 from the Iowa 46. Aaaaand it's incomplete. Another bad break for the 'Cats. Johnson makes a low catch, and picks up the first down. However, it's under review. On second down, Sullivan runs up the middle for eight. Tackle by Xavier Nwankpa sets up third-and-4 from the Iowa 46. Sullivan runs right up into the pressure and loses two. Sullivan scrambles for a first down. Nearly a late hit on Nick Jackson.

Northwestern at its own 48, and putting together a solid drive. Porter is wrapped up by Higgins for a gain of four. Now 27 yards for the senior on the ground. With Castro coming in hot on a corner blitz, Sullivan hits Johnson for a first down.

First catch for No. 14. Sullivan escapes the pocket and scrambles for no gain. Stevens' kick goes out of the end zone for a touchback. We have points! Touchdown, Iowa.

Hill finds Ostrenga wide open on the same boot concept, and it's 7-0 Hawkeyes.

Will that prove enough on the board? Kilbane shoots down the line to stop Patterson at the 2. Hill sneaks for a first down.

First-and-goal Iowa. This is real life. Mueller cuts down Patterson to bring up third-and-1 from the Northwestern 5. Huge play here. Williams works to the Northwestern 10 after multiple misses. Bryce Gallagher was there to clean it up. Williams works upfield for the first down. Hill works the PA Boot to find Ostrenga, who works the ball to the Northwestern 18. Gain of seven on first. Renner's punt is partially blocked, and Iowa will start at the Northwestern 25.

First game-changing play on special teams, and it's the Hawkeyes who capitalize. Porter is swarmed after a minimal gain, and, lo and behold, the second half begins with a punt.

Shocker. Sullivan keeps it on a QB Draw but is tossed out of bounds by Jay Higgins. Sets up third-and-18. Porter shoots up the middle for a solid gain, but a hold on Thomas Gordon moves it back. 

Six penalties on the Wildcats. On the first play from the second half, Sullivan checks it down to Joseph Himon II, but Sebastian Castro meets him immediately. Drew Stevens' kick to start the second half is fair caught by Azema, so Northwestern will start at its 25. Northwestern lacrosse being honored at halftime. Izzy Scane needs to give a dissertation on how to play offense right now. Will history repeat itself from the Friendly Confines?? HALF: Iowa 0, Northwestern 0

All I can say is that I hope you took the under. Iowa takes a knee, and we can finally end maybe the worst half in the history of football. Renner's kick is downed with 29 seconds left at the Iowa 29. Sullivan hits Henning in the flat, but the receiver is short and out of bounds. David Braun has to send the punt team out for the sixth time. Iowa now calls timeout with 41 seconds left in the half. Third-and-10 will follow. Porter hits the left side, and the clock is still running. Yahya Black dumps Sullivan, and Iowa uses its first timeout. Second sack of the day for the Hawkeyes. Illegal formation on Northwestern on the punt is declined. Ball at the Wildcats' 20 with 49 ticks left. Hill overshoots Ragaini on third down down the near sideline, and another punt will commence. A Williams draw sets up third-and-10. Ninety seconds left in the half, and still no score. Williams is stopped by Mueller for one yard. Luke Akers sends a boot that's fair caught by DeJean. A 48-yard punt. Sullivan throws incomplete for Henning with Quinn Schulte in coverage. An illegal chop block on Carsello *and* Tyus is declined. It's Ben Wrather, who walked to the sideline with help. Jackson Carsello now at center. Tyus is tackled by Joe Evans and loses one. A Northwestern player is down. On an RPO, Sullivan finds Henning for a bubble screen. Gain of four yards. Taylor with a rare miscue, as his punt goes into the end zone. Seth Anderson can't haul in the pass from Hill, and Taylor's out to punt.

Stop me if you've heard this before. Patterson picks up nine on a very late draw, creating a third-and-4 for the Hawkeyes. Under 4 minutes to go in the half. Hubbard shoots in to drop Hill, who was looking deep! Four sacks in two games for No. 91. Renner's kick bounces end-over-end and is picked up prematurely by Will Halkyard. Iowa will start at the Northwestern 46. On third-and-11, Sullivan throws too wide for Cam Johnson. The two have yet to link this afternoon. Porter is met immediately up the middle after outstanding penetration from Craig. Sullivan keeps but is tackled for no gain by Deonte Craig. Taylor's punt bounds out at the Northwestern 12. Hill throws with nobody in the area on third down, and a hold on Iowa is declined. Second punt upcoming for Taylor. Garnett Hollis Jr. is questionable to return with an upper body injury, per Northwestern Athletics. Hubbard meets Williams right out of the backfield, setting up third-and-8. Michael Kilbane stops Williams after three yards. More strong work from the first-year DL. Williams pushes forward for a first down and seven more yards. DeJean, now working on offense (probably about time) gets seven on a reverse. DeJean picks up 12 on the punt, breaking two tackles. Sullivan throws a dart to Cam Johnson down the sideline, but the receiver can't come down with it. He had a step against DeJean before No. 3 closed ground. Josh Thompson called for a false start, and we'll back it up five yards.

Fifth penalty on the Wildcats, who have 51 penalty yards. NU goes back to Tyus, who's dumped after a gain of just three. Sets up third-and-2 for Northwestern. Wildcats are 1-for-3 on third down. Anthony Tyus III gets his first carry of the day and amasses five before being swarmed by Hawkeyes. Sullivan keeps on a zone read and has enough for the first down. Porter gets the rock to start the Northwestern drive and collects six. First career pick for No. 10, and it hardly could've come at a better time. Hill looks deep into the end zone, but he's picked off by Theran Johnson! An unbelievable turn of events. Kenny Soares II and Hollis Jr. meet Vines on a double reverse, but Hollis was injured.

The corner is now up and standing, accompanied by trainers. And now, Northwestern is called for sideline interference. A 15-yard call moves Iowa to the Northwestern 30.

Cataclysmic calls for NU so far. Hill finds Vines open to the right side for a first down.

Hill is 6-for-6, by the way. Aidan Hubbard drags down Patterson from behind on a toss. Good backside pursuit from the reigning Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week. Patterson gets skinny in the hole to move the sticks. Patterson gets three on second down, creating third-and-1 from the Iowa 42. Hill rolls out on a boot and finds Addison Ostrenga for a pickup of six. End of the first quarter: Iowa 0, Northwestern 0

31 total yards for the two teams. Oh baby. Renner shrewdly angles the kick away from DeJean, and Iowa will begin at its own 34. On third-and-22, Sullivan keeps and is decked by Jay Higgins. Disastrous possession that looked promising for Northwestern. Ben Wrather's snap is too early, and Northwestern loses 17. Terrible break, and something that can't happen. Sullivan drops it off to Marshall Lang for five, moving the ball into Iowa territory. Porter hits the right side and has enough for the first down. Sullivan is *nearly* intercepted after DeJean broke on the slant. No. 6 is lucky to get that back. Starting at its own 36, Porter rushes for eight. Strong gain up the gut. Stevens' kick hits the right upright! It's no good. Mueller blows up a run to Williams, and Iowa is at its own 36. Ferentz sends out Drew Stevens to try a 54-yarder. Williams tries the middle this time and is stopped by Michael Kilbane. That brings up third-and-8.

Two passes, 12 rushes for Iowa so far. Williams bounces outside to the left, gaining one after being met by Coco Azema. Hill looks deep down the far sideline to Vines, and Hollis is called for his second PI of the game. Iowa at the Northwestern 34 again. Mueller wraps up Williams in the backfield for a TFL. Hayden Large picks up 15 on a short flat route and catch. Takes away a 45-yard return. Wow.

Hawkeyes will start their second at their own 37. Cooper DeJean fields a bouncing ball all the way into the Northwestern 20, but an illegal block in the back negates it. Heavy boos by the Iowa fans.

(Also, DeJean is a freak athlete) Sullivan is dropped by Nick Jackson. Hunter Renner will punt *very* backed up at his own 6. Cam Porter gets the first carry of the day for Northwestern on a pitch and gets only three. Third-and-8 upcoming. Sullivan throws a quick screen to Henning, which loses a yard. A whole lot more full in that student section  A.J. Henning calls for a fair catch (legally of course) at the 12. Cat and mouse game as David Braun declines an Iowa delay of game. Jaylen Pate with a MAJOR strip sack on third down, but Iowa recovers. However, it knocks Iowa back to the NU 39, and Kirk Ferentz will send out Tory Taylor. A draw to Williams collects three, creating third-and-7 from the NU 31. A screen to Diante Vines nets zero. First completion of the game at the 10:35 mark. Hill's third down pass is incomplete, but Theran Johnson is assessed for PI. Two backbreaking penalties for David Braun's defense so far.

Iowa at the Northwestern 34. Turner meets Patterson in the hole again, establishing a third-and-4. Jaziun Patterson picks up five before getting demolished by Devin Turner. Hill lowers his shoulder and picks up the first down on a sneak. Advantage of being a 6-foot-3, 258-pound QB. Williams with another carry, but he's short of the marker. Third-and-1 for Brian Ferentz and Co. Williams rumbles his way for eight on first down. Iowa at its own 43 on this first possession. Deacon Hill throws incomplete on third down, but a pass interference on Hollis Jr. gives Iowa a fresh set of downs. Back to Williams go the Hawkeyes, but Xander Mueller meets him for a gain of three. Third-and-3 for Iowa. Leshon Williams starts the day on the ground (no shocker) and picks up four. Good tackle by Garnett Hollis Jr. Luke Akers kicks off, and Kaden Wetjen returns it to the Iowa 24. Iowa wins the toss and will receive the ball to start. A ""Let's Go Hawks"" chant breaks out as Iowa takes the field. A look at Northwestern's makeshift student section in the Wrigley bleachers, 7 minutes before kick: So, in the early window:

Wisconsin loses to Indiana AND Nebraska loses to Michigan State...

Both teams are 5-4 and 3-3 in conference play...

With a win today, Northwestern could firmly enter the Big Ten West race

(ducks) Not too shabby of a venue for some Wildcat football  Not your conventional way to watch Iowa-Northwestern, so make sure you know how to do so.  A whole lot of low scores projected. Payne currently in a heated discussion with the referees as displeasure with the officiating rings around the stands.

‘Cats’ Big Ten Tournament ends after one match, falling 1-0 to the Wolverines, but some questionable refereeing decisions will loom over this result. Northwestern players appealing for a handball in the Michigan box, but after lengthy discussion amongst the officials, it’s not given.

88’ | NU 0 | MICH 1 Goldson does his best Superman impression to keep a Gajadhar volley from finding the back of the net.

‘Cats pushing for an equalizer.

82’ | NU 0 | MICH 1 Goal. Michigan.

A deflected shot falls to Alex Waggoner, who fires past Jackson Weyman from close range.

72’ | NU 0 | MICH (1) A *wild* scramble in the Michigan box from an Henri Richter long throw somehow doesn’t result in a Northwestern goal, despite the ball appearing to cross the line from our vantage point.

52’ | NU 0 | MICH 0 Back underway at Martin Stadium.

The heavens have opened, and the ‘Cats will be looking to open up this Michigan defense in the second 45.

46’ | NU 0 | MICH 0 The ‘Cats have been all over the Wolverines so far, but couldn’t find a goal to capitalize on their dominance in the first half.

Northwestern is currently outshooting Michigan 8-1, and most of the period was played in the vistors’ half.

HT | NU 0 | MICH 0 Justin Weiss just hit the crossbar from 40 yards out. Wow.

1’ | NU 0 | MICH 0 Northwestern will face Michigan for the second time in six days shortly as it looks to get payback for the 3-0 defeat it suffered Sunday.

There’s also a Big Ten Tournament semifinal spot on the line.

We’re here at Martin Stadium — stay tuned for updates! With only a handful of games remaining in the college football season, the awards race is coming into focus.  lays out the current candidates for Big Ten Coach of the Year, and makes the case for Northwestern’s very own David Braun.  gives some key insight into the Hawkeyes’ season thus far, and how they might fare on Saturday. Northwestern will advance to its second-straight Big Ten title game thanks to a three-goal flurry in the third quarter in a 3-1 win over Ohio State. FINAL: Northwestern 3, Ohio State 1

The Wildcats have never won the Big Ten Tournament and the regular season title in the same season. They'll have the chance to do so against either Maryland or Rutgers on Sunday after an offensive explosion in the third quarter. Ohio State is down but not out. With four minutes to play, they get the ball inside the circle again. Ohio State gets on the board with a goal from Hallie Brost. Buckeyes cut the deficit to 3-1 with about six minutes to play. They wiped the Halsey goal off the board and Northwestern really said, ""And I took that personally"" END OF THIRD: Northwestern 3, Ohio State 0
For about 40 minutes, it seemed like OSU had a legit chance to win this game or at least force OT. And then *that* happened. Holy s----, they did it again. Three goals in three minutes. Total offensive eruption by Northwestern. Relford feeds Bent-Cole for a 1-on-1 goal, and it's 3-0. Goal stands after a review, and NU is now in firm control of this one. And not even 30 seconds after this, Wadas doubles the score off ANOTHER corner to make it 2-0! ILSE TROMP WITH THE GOAL OFF THE CORNER, and Northwestern has taken a 1-0 lead late in the third! NU forces a corner, and the 'Cats are really starting to get a head of steam. A ton of pressure on OSU's defense right now. Northwestern's press generates two clean looks, but the 'Cats can't convert -- an infraction wipes off what looked like an apparent goal of the board. Skubisz with ANOTHER SAVE near the side of the net on a loose ball!! Second half is underway, with a trip to the Big Ten title game on the line. To Brendan Sullivan: I owe you an apology, I wasn’t really familiar with your game. The Wildcats’ season all hinges around one of the best point guards in the country. HALF: NU 0, OSU 0

The Buckeyes are holding up really well, and have had momentum for a good portion of the first 30 minutes. 

This could be an Annabel Skubisz legacy game though. She’s got four saves already. Ilse Tromp’s shot off the corner (with the deflection by Halsey) goes just wide. Another loose ball with Skubisz saving it on her back, but NU escapes. Eight minutes left in the half. OSU with ANOTHER chance with the ball right behind Skubisz, but it gets knocked away. Another corner coming up. Peyton Halsey gets a good look from long-range off the corner, but it’s saved on the ground. Lauren Wadas picks up a green card. OSU again gets inside the circle, and stays there for around 20 seconds. Two saves from Skubisz get the ‘Cats out of the jam, but the Buckeyes are having their way in the midfield right now. Caileigh Walsh showcased her two-way ability throughout 2022-23, and another leap from her could jumpstart Northwestern’s climb up the Big Ten. END OF FIRST: Northwestern 0, Ohio State 0

The game is starting to open up for both teams after the Buckeyes did a great job neutralizing NU’s passing/counterattack. Olivia Bent-Cole almost makes a game-changing move in transition, but *just* misses Chloe Relford near the back side of the goal.

NU’s first really great chance today. In a game that started the week with the lowest over/under in history, it’s only fitting that special teams were a big topic of discussion ahead of Iowa-Northwestern. Ten minutes in, and we’re still knotted up at zero. Transition game starting to open up for both teams, but no truly clean shots on goal yet from either team. First penalty corner of the game goes to the Buckeyes, who are threatening inside. OSU looked like it had a clean look at the goal just 90 seconds in, but Annabel Skubisz kicks it away. Aaaaand they’re off in Ann Arbor. We’ve got field hockey action in just about five minutes! Northwestern looks to head to the Big Ten Championship with a win over Ohio State today in Ann Arbor.

Tune into BTN to watch, and here for tweets! Ohio State and Michigan back-to-back in late November… After last night, is it not too late to add a certain No. 13 in purple and white to this list?? The keys to a second-straight NCAA appearance? Doing much of what led to the first one again. The ‘Cats finished their fall slate on the fairways with a bang. That wraps up tonight’s pressers. Barnhizer: “The stats are at zero now. Excited for three days of practice and then start our season against Binghamton.” Langborg on tonight’s three point shooting: “It’s all about sharing the ball. If we get open looks, we’re going to hit them.” Barnhizer on being named captain: “It means everything.” Langborg: “I had a couple bonehead fouls. I can’t put my teammates in that position.”

“You can’t play worrying about fouls because you’ll end up getting one.” Barnhizer: “It was cool to get a start. I saw a lot of open shots because we have a ton of offensive weapons. I just got hot.” That’ll do it for Collins. 

Brooks Barnhizer and Ryan Langborg will be next to the podium. Collins on Luke Hunger: “He’s a young player that’s figuring it out. We’re going to need him. I’m excited for Luke to keep getting experience.” Collins: “We need to learn how to play aggressively but play smart.” Collins on perimeter defense: “We need to sure that up.” Collins on getting ready for Binghamton: “We have to continue to fine tune the defensive end. We need to sure that up a little bit.” Collins on playing a game like atmosphere: ""It was huge. To be able to play different styles was really good for us. It was good for us to see."" Collins: ""We're a little bit more dynamic on offense this year.""

""Our defense is the area where we need to improve."" Collins on free throws: ""We got to make them."" Collins: ""I thought Ty's looks tonight were good."" Collins reiterated that he had no subs tonight, which forced Barnhizer and Berry to play extended minutes. Collins on Justin Mullins: ""He's going to be a key guy for this team."" Collins: ""Work in progress for sure. We got to get better, but excited to get going Monday night."" Collins: ""We made great decisions. Our guys really share the ball.""

He pointed to the 'Cats' 25 assists to three turnovers. Collins: ""We were severally undermanned.""

Credit his guys for playing extended minutes: ""You never want to do that in an exhibition, but we had no choice."" Collins sends his thoughts and prayers to Coach Knight's family. Chris Collins at the podium FINAL: Northwestern defeats McKendree 85-63.

The next time the Wildcats take the floor, it counts. That'll do it for Barnhizer's night

The junior finished the game with 29 points, seven rebounds, four assists, four blocks and five steals.

Yeah, he's going to be a problem. Mckendree has cut NU's lead to under 20.

'Cats leave 77-59 with 3:32 left in the game. Northwestern is now 5-11 from the free throw line tonight. Luke Hunger, who missed most of last season with a foot injury, checks into the game for the first time tonight Add a filthy block to his last few minutes.

He just sent that ball back to New Jersey. Langborg starting to get hot.

The Princeton transfer connected on back-to-back triples to push the 'Cats' lead to 28. Northwestern still leads by 22, but Chris Collins is not happy with his squad and calls a timeout.

62-40 NU with 12 minutes left to play. Brooks Barnhizer is doing whatever he wants.

The junior has 12 second-half points with over 10 minutes left to play. Northwestern is ahead 56-35 with 15 minutes left to play.

Boo Buie has not even reached double figures. Barnhizer gets the first points of the half more than two minutes in, then pokes the ball away and throws it down. The next possession, he connects from beyond the arc.

Watch out. Halftime: Northwestern leads McKendree 45-30.

Brooks Barnhizer leads the way with 13 points. Ty Berry is 2-8 in from three, with a lot rimming in and out.

Not the best start as the Senior looks to find his shot this season. Scramble for the ball finds Barnhizer, and he buries a corner three.

The junior is already in double digits. We may be looking at a hack-a-Blake situation this year.

The grad misses both from the line, and NU is now 4-9 from the charity stripe this game. Langborg already has three fouls, so it has been Justin Mullins on the floor for most of the first half.

Sure looks like the Denver transfer will be the first off the bench for Chris Collins this season. Barnhizer with the steal, and Mullins lays it in to push Northwestern’s lead back to 15 with six minutes left in the half.

Timeout McKendree. McKendree has cut its deficit to 8, making its last four attempts from the field. Northwestern swings the rock around, and the extra pass finds a wide open Berry, who hits from three.

23-9 NU with 11:38 left in the first half. BLAKE PRESTON SAYS NO SIR

The graduate transfer swats a layup off the backboard, and Justin Mullins finishes on the other end.

All three transfers are making contributions early. 'Cats have hit four straight threes and are on a 6-0 run.

16-5 NU after five and a half minutes of play. Buie and Langborg both can't connect from beyond the arc, but the Wildcats grab two offensive boards and Buie drills a triple.

Barnhizer follows it up with a three of his own and it is 8-3 NU with 16 minutes left in the half. For clarification, Chris Collins told the media yesterday that all three would be unavailable tonight. 'Cats force a shot-clock violation on their first defensive possession.

Chris Lowery is back. For the first time this season, well not officially, Nicholson has won the tip, and we are off. No spoilers, but this year’s hype video is incredible. Tonight’s starters are

PG: Boo Buie
SG: Ty Berry
SF: Ryan Langborg
PF: Brooks Barnhizer
C: Matt Nicholson

Those five should be the starters when the season officially tips off on Monday night. No surprise but Nick Martinelli, Jordan Clayton and Parker Strauss are all in sweatsuits and will not play tonight. We’re so back. 

Northwestern will have one final exhibition against McKendree tonight before the season opener on Monday night. 

Follow along for updates! “If I haven’t put it in writing yet, I will right now: Northwestern football has completely shocked me this season. I was wrong about this team,” writes . So in addition to this…

- FIVE All-Big Ten First Team members (Skubisz, Marshall, Bent-Cole, Halsey, Wadas)

- Two All-Big Ten Second Team members (Hinke, Tromp)

- B1G Goalkeeper of the Year (Skubisz)

…in the most loaded conference in the country. Can’t get much better. Fresh off a heartbreaking NCAA tourney lost last season, men’s tennis is reloaded with young talent: Don’t look now, but *multiple* scenarios exist for the ‘Cats to win the craziest division in Power 5 football: With the starting PG spot (and the captainship!) now hers, Caroline Lau should be primed to take a big leap in Year Two. A former ‘Cat found the end zone in Week Eight: Coming back for his junior year is one of Northwestern’s most coveted players: Brooks Barnhizer. Oh, so close. How Northwestern’s men’s soccer team almost won the Big Ten regular season title: The middle tier of the Big Ten was shaken up by upsets galore. Here’s where things stand: That wraps up today's men's basketball availability. Barnhizer said that his goal is to ""set the tempo"" as a starter rather than playing with fearlessness off the bench. Barnhizer on the offense: ""I think Ty is going to have a great year. I think it'll be awesome to see how we fit together. I feel like everybody loves throwing the ball to everybody."" Barnhizer said that he sat down with Buie this summer to indicate that it's the junior's time to step up and fill roles. Barnhizer: ""I really want to make a jump, not just on the floor, but in the locker room."" Barnhizer on Buie's return: ""I think he's the best point guard in the country. It means everything, because everyone else is extra motivated.""

Noted that it ""meant the world"" to have him back. Brooks Barnhizer now up. Buie on making consecutive NCAA Tournaments: ""That would mean everything."" Buie: ""You want to stay consistent. You always want to block out the outside noise. The people from the outside, it's easy for them to judge."" Buie: ""We don't really look at who we're playing too much. It's all about our habits."" Buie on working with new guards: ""With these new guys, I also feel like we have a really good connection.""

Said that Ryan Langborg has been at a ""similar level"" in terms of his career. Buie: ""The goal is to be really good in March. It's still early."" Buie on the scrimmage: ""I think we did really good. Obviously, there's gonna be some ups and downs."" Buie on learning from the loss to UCLA: ""It's just a confidence-booster. Losing by five and knowing that we didn't really play our best, it gives a lot of confidence going into this year."" Buie on his program accolades: ""I don't really chase individual goals. My only goal is to win every game that I participate in."" Buie on his decision to stay: ""It was kind of easy. I was kind of just around the gym and around the guys. My heart felt here."" Buie: ""I'm super excited to be back. I think we've got a chance to be really good. I think that we're really connected."" Buie on Halloween: ""I'm Boo. That's what I'm here for Halloween."" Boo Buie now speaking to the media. Collins on the new Ryan Field proposal: ""I think it only enhances where we're at over here. I can't wait for that to be completed.""

Joked that he hopes construction doesn't take his parking spot. Collins on managing size in lineups: ""I think last year, if you really look at it, we really played that lineup a lot.""

Mentioned that NU is ""counting"" on Martinelli's development.

""It's not like we're going to be small the whole game."" Collins on Brian James' impact: ""Coach James is part of my family. When I first got here, he was the first person I wanted to hire for all the reasons you said. He helped teach me the game.""

Praised his knowledge at the high school and NBA level. Collins on Ty Berry: ""He's shot the ball really well. Certainly getting a little bit more arc on his shot was something we talked about.""

Noted that Berry ""did the other things exceptionally well"" despite shooting woes. Collins noted that there's ""less of a sell"" to recruits about coming to Northwestern after making the NCAA Tournament. Collins on recruiting: ""I don't get into much to stars and ratings. We have to stay true to the guys that fit our program. The mentality of those guys.""

Also, said that he's ""super proud"" of fellow GBN alum and Duke head coach Jon Scheyer, who he considers a little brother. Collins said that NU wanted to have ""two high-level games"" against Dayton and Arizona State. Collins noted that all returning players had ""good offseasons"" and are ""more seasoned leaders.""

""You're talking about four guys who played a major, major role. We're really leaning on those guys to help lead the way."" Collins: ""You want people to praise you for a good job. In this instance, you've got to eliminate that as well. You've got to keep an even keel."" Collins joked that he wanted to play Binghamton to induce argument between Tony Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon on PTI. Collins noted that Northwestern wanted to play McKendree because of the team making the DII NCAA Tournament.

Called the team a ""formidable opponent."" Collins: ""We have 20 league games, which is a monster slate. In our non-league, we try to balance it out. How do you get the right games in the right place, and put the schedule together?"" Collins on the scrimmage: ""We were down a few guys. Just to get out there. When you play other people, you get an idea of where you're at, good and bad.""

Said the team has a ""long way to go"" but that he liked team connection. Collins on learning from 2017-18: ""I was a young coach at that point, figuring it out... Six years older and grayer. Have to wear reading glasses now. I take a lot of responsibility for not helping that next year's team."" Collins on defense: ""No one is going to be able to do what Chase did in terms of getting steals... But we hope our scheme is in place. We feel like we have to be a really good team defensive unit."" Collins: ""We begin our new journey tomorrow."" Collins on what he instilled this summer: ""I think you have to re-establish your habits.""

Said defensive skills don't ""just happen by osmosis.""

Stressed building camaraderie with six new players. Collins said that Nick Martinelli, Jordan Clayton and Parker Strauss will be out tomorrow for the exhibition game.

""We're hopeful that this is nothing long-term."" Collins: ""I know our guys are looking forward to not playing against each other."" Chris Collins now speaking to the media at Welsh-Ryan Arena.

On the snow: ""It confirmed that it's basketball season. We're excited to get going.""

Said the team ""has a lot to work on"" in the preseason. Before the Wildcats travel downtown to the Friendly Confines, hear from David Braun about keeping intensity up after a huge win, development of Northwestern’s D-line, preparing for Cooper DeJean and even the Braun family’s Halloween costume plans. As Northwestern takes on Iowa at Wrigley, the age-old saying of “defense wins championships” comes to mind. With meaningful competition on the horizon, the October NAC offered a gauge for ‘Cats to figure out where they stand. Northwestern volleyball played eight sets against Big Ten foes this past week. That concludes today's media availability. Braun said he has a sweet tooth.

""When I get home, their candy will probably be hidden."" Braun on A.J. Henning having six targets: ""I think that's always something that's on the forefront of Mike's mind. I think some of the specific scheme was more tailored to what we were seeing out of Maryland. We know the playmaker that A.J. is."" Braun on Joseph Himon II: ""It's awesome. That dude was such a headache such spring ball to me as a defensive coordinator. Gave our defense fits this fall camp. You can see the way that our guys respond when Joe gets the ball in space.""

Praised the blocking efforts downfield. Braun on special teams: ""Expecting them to continue doing what they're doing.""

Said that Jack Olsen ""continues to play at a really high level"" and called Olsen, Halkyard and Renner ""pros.""

""They have their routine. They stick to it. They take ownership in their craft."" Braun said that he doesn't have any Halloween plans, but that his wife Kristin has Mario costumes lined up for his kids. More: ""We're going to have to do a great job of focusing on the details.""

Said that ""competitive demeanor"" will have to be met with ""poise."" Braun on the lack of a win streak: ""I'm proud of the way that we've responded after losses, for sure. What a great opportunity for us to keep momentum. So much of it is isolating one game at a time. It's going to be absolutely critical that we completely put Maryland behind us."" Braun on the use of practice to evaluate players: ""I think we're in a unique setting. It's going to take all of us. Owning your role.""

Said that Kilbane ""helped us in a big way"" to beat Maryland. More: ""He's a dude.""

Noted that NU will need to be creative in certain looks to avoid return opportunities. Braun on Cooper DeJean in the return game: ""My first conversation was with Matt Entz. I really would've appreciated if Matt could've closed that so we wouldn't have to do deal with that now.""

Called him a ""model"" of what Iowa stands for. Braun: ""We're going to have a great week of preparation. That starts this afternoon."" Braun on the attitude: ""We've got to respond. How are we going to respond to success? How are we going to respond to people talking about bowl games, and the Big Ten West? Tuning it all out, guys. It's interference. What do we need to do today to position ourselves?"" Braun: ""I feel like great D-line play is guys playing free. It's, 'Man, I'm going to play vertical, knockback, aggressive football.'"" Braun: ""If you watch me in D-line drills, I might stick around for a while. I'm pretty passionate about that position."" Braun on Michael Kilbane and Dylan Roberts: ""Part of it was out of necessity in terms of where we're at from a depth perspective. They earned that opportunity with their practice habits, with the way they're performing on scout team.""

Said it's not based on ""one flash practice."" Noted Sullivan's need to be a great decision-maker and game manager against the Hawkeyes.

""There's no doubt in my mind that he's going to continue to put our team in a lot of situations to win football games."" Braun on Iowa's defense: ""We'll all be challenged in so many ways. This defense is a model for consistency. It's impressive. We're going to have to detail our work this week.""

Noted that Sullivan needs to focus on taking care of the football, his eyes and his process. Also praised Bajakian's play-calling for allowing Sullivan to get the ball out more quickly. Braun on conversations with Brendan Sullivan: ""The first thing that I told him was that I was proud of him. You evaluate where he needs to be better. Coach Bajakian expects a lot out of Brendan. I think we did a really good job this week of getting Sully comfortable."" Braun on Aidan Hubbard: ""Really proud of Aidan. I think what we're starting to see are the things that we've seen out of Aidan in practice on a consistent basis. Has really developed as a pass-rusher.""

Noted that he lacked ""urgency"" and ""motor"" in the spring but refined those. Braun on differences in playing at Wrigley: ""We'll have to be very strategic in that.""

Noted that both teams will be on the same sideline, as was the case in 2021.

""I firmly am confident that our guys will handle it well."" Braun said that NU ""anticipated"" that Maryland was going to pass on fourth down.

Gave credit to Xander Mueller for the key stop. More: ""You look at some of those guys lined up, you're going: 'I'll take this group any day.""

Noted that the D-line ""will be tested in a big, big way"" against the Hawkeyes. Braun on the defense's goal-line stand against Maryland: ""What that D-line room has been able to do this season is such a reflection of what you hope is happening all over this team right now. It's banked reps from us double-repping during fall camp. It's developmental reps."" Braun on the over/under being 29.5: ""Honestly, I know it sounds super cliche: I wasn't aware of that.""

Noted that the team has ""all the extra motivation it needs."" Braun on playing at Wrigley Field: ""I know that I've had a lot of these moments in the last year, but it's another pinch yourself moment.""

Said that the first baseball game he went to was at the Friendly Confines.

""What a unique, special experience."" Braun on Ben Bryant's availability: ""Do not anticipate Ben playing this week.""

Noted that he's ""progressing,"" but that ""he is working his but off."" Stressed that the team anticipates him returning this year. Braun: ""We know the challenge that is ahead.""

Talked about Iowa's fundamentals, technique and physicality. Braun's opening statement: ""Exciting time to be around the facility right now. Team that battled on Saturday, found a way to get a big win. We were back at it this morning evaluating the film.""

No announcement on who will be under center for the ‘Cats today We have you covered before the ‘Cats and Badgers kick off. When Boo Buie picked up his fourth foul with 9:12 left and Dayton shooting well, Northwestern had to find a new way to win in a big game. It did.

As  writes, “The only certainty so far is that Northwestern still hasn’t run out of surprises.” Our staffers favor the Badgers in today’s matchup, but there’s optimism that the Wildcats can win in Madison for the first time since 2015. Good news in terms of Bryant's injury progress, but still uncertainty regarding who gets the nod for Northwestern today. That’s all from Welsh-Ryan. Barnhizer on his inspiration for his motor: “As a sophomore, I had to do that to get on the court. It’s a part of me. I’m never gonna lose what got me on to the floor.” Langborg on Berry: “When he hit those threes, our entire team lit up.”

Barnhizer: “He’s the most energetic guy on our team.” Langborg on the defensive performance: ""It was a step up, but there were too many threes."" Barnhizer credited the balance with the offensive rebounding and not allowing a bunch of fastbreak points to coaching. Notes that the team usually crashes three, and did a good job of understanding the situation  each shot. Barnhizer on Martinelli: “He’s huge. Good thing about Nick is, he loves ball. The problem was this summer, the coaches had to tell him to chill out.”

Compared Martinelli’s role this year to his own last year. Langborg and Barnhizer at the podium. That’s all from Collins. Collins on dealing with defensive pressure: “I thought we did pretty darn good, with only 7 turnovers. We’re we perfect? No, but we didn’t turn the ball over.” Collins on defending Da’Ron Holmes: “We came into the gameplan trying to get the ball out of his hands. They did a great job of hurting us, and we called off our double-teams.”

Credited Brea and Santos for their shooting. Collins especially praised Langborg’s aggressiveness after Buie picked up his fourth foul. “We needed that.” Collins on the fan support: ""It was awesome. I got a rush of energy when I walked out on the floor. You get a llittle bounce in your step.

""I hope we can make this where it doesn't have to be a Dayton coming in here. It was a fun night."" Brendan Sullivan didn’t get to sling the ball often at Wrigley Field, but when he did, his tape indicated a mixed bag. The selection committee may not think so, but Northwestern sure looked like the best team in the land on Friday afternoon. FINAL: Northwestern 3, Miami (OH) 0

The Wildcats dominate on both ends in their NCAA Tournament debut, and will face the winner of the Iowa-Louisville matchup in the quarters on Sunday afternoon. Northwestern snuffs out a Miami corner. Under seven minutes to play, and this is pretty much over. The call gets overturned? No foul Some beautiful ball movement from the 'Cats before Wadas gets tripped inside the circle. Play is under review. Two more corners for NU, two saves. The 'Cats have seven shots on goal now. END OF THIRD: NU 3, Miami 0
For the second time in three contests, Northwestern breaks the game open with a third-quarter outburst. Goals from Bent-Cole and Tromp have all but put this one away. Olivia Bent-Cole scored. 3-0.

Miami starting to generate some momentum in transition, but a takeaway from Northwestern leads to another corner. Another chance to double the lead Miami's first shot of the day is knocked away by Annabel Skubisz! Some really nice stick work by Miami down the sideline, and the RedHawks draw a corner. Their first huge scoring opportunity of the day. Tromp zings it.... off the crossbar. It sounded like the back of the net rang, that's how hard the shot was. So close to doubling the lead. It took three minutes for Northwestern to earn its first corner of the second half. Shot is saved, but Northwestern earns another. Second half is underway. HALFTIME: Northwestern 1, Miami (OH) (total shots) 0

The Wildcats absolutely dominated possession in the first half, and are 30 minutes away from a rematch with either Iowa or Louisville in the quarters. Lindsey Frank with a takeaway in Miami's end, and she almost got a clean look at the goal, but her shot is blocked. Under five minutes to go in the first half. This press, as it has been all year, is absolutely stifling. We are more than 21 minutes in, and Miami has not taken a single shot. Another corner for Northwestern, but this time the ensuing shot goes wide. END OF FIRST: Northwestern 1, Miami (OH) 0
It was quiet on both sides to start, but the 'Cats gradually got some pressure on the RedHawks' side of the field, and it paid off in Wadas' goal. First corner for Northwestern with just under a minute to go, and it finds the back of the net! It's Lauren Wadas to put the 'Cats up 1-0! Eleven minutes in, and Alia Marshall takes the first shot of the game. It deflects upward and bounces toward the side of the net. Through five minutes, no shots from either team. Some sloppy passing on both sides, as the ball's stayed in the midfield for the most part. We're off! No lineup changes from the Big Ten Tournament Final: Skubisz, Wadas, Bent-Cole, Halsey, Tromp, Hinke, Relford, Katie Jones, Lauren Hunter, Marshall, Frank Live from Lakeside Field, where the ‘Cats begin their postseason quest for a third straight trip to the title game (and second championship in three years) against Miami Ohio! Stay tuned for live tweets and some written coverage! Which happens this Saturday: Northwestern snap a 14-game road skid, or the Wildcats drop two straight for the first time all year? ,  and  try to make sense of it (and the Wrigley game) on Pound the Talk. Northwestern women’s basketball played an offensive barnburner against UIC last night that left no shortage of takeaways. Here are three: With Northwestern venturing to Camp Randall Stadium for its game in just over 24 hours, take a deeper dive into the Badgers in Luke Fickell’s first season. Next up in Olympic sports previews: the 2023-24 wrestling squad. That’ll do it for tonight’s availability. McKeown** McKeown: ""A lot of great things happened tonight."" McKeown notes that Crystal Wang and Mercy Ademusayo will play big roles for the 'Cats. McKeown on Walsh: ""She's a big piece if we're going to be successful. We gotta keep her out of foul trouble."" McKewon on UIC's 18-0 run: ""Not what you game plan. We came out in complete control, but I thought we played too fast and played into their hands."" McKewon: ""A tale of two halves. I really liked the way we played in overtime. There are a lot of things we need to work on.""

He then gives a shoutout to  for getting into the game. McKewon now at the podium. Daley: ""We have a chip on our shoulder. Last year was rough. We have nothing to lose. We're coming for it all."" Mott on Lau: "" I'm so proud of her. She's a natural leader."" Mott on turnovers: ""A lot of it is our own fault. A lot of unforced errors.""

Northwestern Women’s Basketball tips off its season in a few minutes against UIC. 

Follow along for updates! Skubisz on staying dialed in on the moment: ""Every game could be your last. The end doesn't matter if you can't get there."" Fuchs on Bent-Cole's speed: ""Speed kills. We have Liv up front, who as a ton of it, and then Alia, Lindsey on the outside. And when Lauren Wadas gets going, she's really quick.

""Your skill has to match your speed. And certainly, Liv epitomizes her skill."" Fuchs called this Northwestern team the most consistent she's coached in 15 years. Skubisz on the difference between the mentality this year and 2021/2022: ""We're not worried about the expectations that have been set for us, we're worried about meeting our own standards that we set at the beginning of the season."" Tracey Fuchs notes that getting to see Miami (OH) last spring has helped the 'Cats getting to know the RedHawks' style of play.

On how they've grown since then: ""We're so much more balanced across every line."" Annabel Skubisz on Northwestern field hockey getting the No. 2 seed: ""I don't want to say slighted, but it pushes us to keep proving ourselves. We've got to show the country that we deserve the No. 1 seed."" Collins mentioned ""breakdowns,"" some of them in communication, as to why the defense faltered against Binghamton.

""It takes time to build that. I'm confident, the more those guys play, the better we'll get on that end."" Collins said that tomorrow's game against Dayton has a ""big-game feel"" and that Northwestern is expecting a sellout.

Stressed that there's ""excitement"" among players in playing the Flyers, who are the A10 preseason favorites. Chris Collins said that Nick Martinelli's minutes limit isn't something that the team isn't worried about ""long term,"" but that NU is still conscious of his injury.

""We've got to look at the long term. He's doing well."" If the Wildcats want to curtail their two-game streak against Wisconsin, they’ll need to execute in these areas. Four of Northwestern fencing’s eight bouts to start the season:

- No. 15 Air Force
- No. 4 Harvard
- No. 3 Columbia
- No. 14 Stanford

About as tough an opening weekend as you’ll find in all of college sports. The Northwestern women’s tennis team got busy on both coasts to conclude its fall slate. With Northwestern women’s basketball’s season starting in just a few hours, our staff writers predict improvement and several breakouts in 2023-24. Non-conference and B1G games alike, Northwestern has its hands full this season: Is it a good thing we're disappointed about a three-point loss to Iowa? NU's football season is nearing its end, but these former ‘Cats are just getting started in the NFL: Entering the final stretch of the season, there’s plenty left up for grabs in the Big Ten. Here’s how teams stack up in Week Ten: From reminiscing about the Fargodome to reflecting on the lessons he’s learned as an interim head coach, David Braun’s weekly presser had it all. Read it below: With a tough slate of games on the horizon, Northwestern volleyball struggled to find success this past weekend. Northwestern field hockey seems unstoppable, but there are a few worthy challengers. Following a year where Iowa brought momentous attention to Big Ten women’s basketball, this season holds much promise. The Northwestern defense was solid on Saturday, but a few shortcomings prevented a Wrigley win. As Northwestern and Wisconsin try to stay alive in the Big Ten West, we look at the matchups that will define this weekend’s matchup. Northwestern basketball changed course in the second half to win its season opener but left the win with plenty to work on. Something about purple teams and No. 4 Michigan State… That ends tonight's media availability. Buie on preparing for Dayton: ""We've just got to take it one day at a time."" Buie on fan support tonight: ""If more was here, it would've been even more fun. It got really loud in there, for how many people were in there.""

Said it was ""awesome"" to have turnout tonight.

""Without them there tonight, I think that game could go differently."" Buie on Barnhizer playing point: ""Brooks is a walking mismatch. He brings a physicality on the defensive end. He's super strong. He's able to find people off the dribble.""

Said he's ""never stopped working"" since he arrived. Langborg on Preston, a fellow transfer: ""Super aggressive. He left it all on the court. Unmatched effort on the bench. That's exactly what we need."" Langborg on playing five guards: ""The bigs have to play on the perimeter. At the end of the day, it just comes down to communication."" Buie on fixing turnovers: ""I think I was just playing a little fast in the beginning. As an older guy, it kind of just slowed down.""

Said that he needs to be ""more poised"" in attacking. Langborg on his first game at Welsh-Ryan Arena: ""I wouldn't say jitters. Just excitement. It was so much fun, to come out of it with a win. We didn't get off to the start we wanted.""

Noted that he's not used to playing in front of many students. Buie on Jordan Clayton: ""I was really impressed by Jordan. He just bought in from the jump. He was one of the best guards on the defensive end tonight. Without his contribution, we don't win that game tonight.""

Called his minutes ""17 strong minutes."" Langborg: ""We're very connected.""

Said that Buie was ""willing"" the team with messages. Buie on tonight's game: ""I just think that our defense, when we first came out, we didn't start off with great offense. They got off to a hot start. That was something that we focused on at halftime.""

Called the better defense a ""standard"" with the need to ""buy in"" on D. Boo Buie and Ryan Langborg now speaking. That's all from Collins from the opener. Collins: ""We would not have won if we were not about the right things tonight.""

Praised ""grit"" and ""toughness."" Collins on maintaining elements from last year to now: ""I have not talked about last year with these guys at all. It's all been about this group. We know we've got to get better. New roles. Every team is different. We're all about now, and not looking back."" Collins on adjusting to Symir Torrence: ""We actually recruited him a little bit when he was in high school. He's a really good player. Forcing him into eight turnovers was really big."" Collins' message to students: ""We need you Friday night. They're going to try to bring the red in the building."" Collins on the Dayton matchup: ""It's the reason why we scheduled the game. We specifically wanted to play a high-level team early to see where we're at.""

Called the Flyers ""terrific."" Collins on Luke Hunger not playing: ""Just kind of matchup. I want him to stay ready.""

Said that the team had to play a smaller lineup because of Binghamton utilizing more guards.

""Sometimes in these non-league games, it's a little bit harder with these bigger guys."" Collins on Justin Mullins: ""He's an athlete. He's a young player. He was able to get his feet wet a little bit.""

Said that he stressed that every player will be needed in his postgame message.

""All these guys who are young players just got to keep working."" Collins on assists/turnovers regressing: ""I thought Boo had a couple sloppy ones he's got to clean up. My goal coming into the game, I try for us to be 2-to-1, or as close to that as possible.""

Said that 10 turnovers is a ""magic number."" Collins on Barnhizer's rebounding: ""We need it. As we play some of the teams, there will be times when we'll be a little bit undersized. I think Brooks is going to be a guy. Workman-like on the glass. Everyone has to chip in.""

Noted a ""gang rebound"" mentality. Collins on Clayton's debut/role: ""I think it was game-by-game. I'm trying to win the game. Tonight, I felt Jordan's defense. He was very solid. He was keeping the ball in front of him. He wasn't turning the ball over. I thought we needed him on the floor."" Collins said that Langborg and Clayton can be ball-handlers when Buie is out.

Called Barnhizer a ""matchup issue"" as the ""power forward."" Collins said that the team wants Buie/Barnhizer/Langborg/Berry to be the ""focus"" of the offense. Stressed foul trouble as not allowing Berry to find a rhythm.

""It's up to me to get those guys shots."" Collins on Clayton: ""For him to come in as a freshman and give us that dirty work, was pretty impressive."" Collins on being better in the fastbreak: ""I think we have to be more opportunistic.""

Said the team needs to do better taking advantage of turnovers.

""I feel like we have more offensive firepower than we had a year ago."" Collins: ""We have a lot to learn. We have a lot to clean up.""

Said that he ""always gets nervous"" about the first game of the year. Collins on the slow defensive start: ""We are integrating new guys, learning new defensive principles. It's not an excuse by any means, but we've had a lot of disruption with injury. We're still getting guys back and figuring out rotations. The new guys learning what's expected."" Collins on his message tonight: ""We've got to grind it out. We struggled early last year, but we found ways to win. That what was most encouraging. I said, 'It's a 20-minute fight. Let's roll our sleeves up.'"" More: ""I just thought we slowed the game down. I thought we got it more possession-by-possession."" Collins on the defensive adjustments made: ""Couple things. First and foremost, get back in transition. I thought in the first half, they really had us on our heels. I thought we slowed them down. I thought we got better in our gap help; we weren't as spread out."" Collins: ""Winning is hard. That's how it is in college basketball. Everybody has good players."" Collins said that Martinelli was on a ""pitch count"" after a foot injury. Collins said that Buie and Barnhizer were ""fantastic,"" stressing Barnhizer's ability to get to the line.

Also said he was ""really impressed"" with Preston and Clayton. Collins: ""We're a work-in-progress. We're not nearly where we need to be yet, but you hopefully can learn lessons by winning games.""

Said the second half featured ""playing like we can play defensively."" Collins says the team was in a ""dogfight."" Also wished Binghamton's coach well in light of a family emergency. Collins' opening statement: ""Certainly elated that we won the game tonight. I knew this was going to be a difficult challenge, watching them on film. You play teams like this, they play very freely in these games. They come in, they really don't have a whole lot to lose."" Chris Collins set to speak to the media shortly. Lots to improve upon, but 1-0 is always nice. FINAL: Northwestern 72, Binghamton 61 

The Wildcats come away 1-0 despite trailing at halftime. The team's defense was steadily improved in the second period. 

Boo Buie contributed 27, while Brooks Barnhizer had 18 and 13 rebounds. Ryan Langborg added 13 points in his debut. 72-61 after two good shots from Barnhizer. An easy miss for the Bearcats causes another foul on Binghamton, and this one is looking like it's over. Buie goes 1-for-2, and it's a nine-point lead for the purple and white. Barnhizer collects his fourth (!) steal of the night, and the Bearcats are running out of steam. Both are made by Barnhizer. 69-61 Wildcats. Barnhizer is whacked after a save by Clayton on an errant pass by Langborg. He'll head to the stripe with 48.4 seconds left, and Benson has fouled out. Benson sinks a floater to make it 67-61. Two more free throws for Buie, who now has 26. 67-59 'Cats, and a whole lot more breathing room. The Bearcats lose the handle, and the crowd is feeling it with NU up by six and two minutes to go. Buie resets, drives and finishes over the defender. Strong work by No. 0, who's up to 24 on the night. The Bearcats just won't go away quite yet. Harried buries a three to make it a four-point game with 2:31 left. Buie hits two free throws, and the Wildcats have a seven-point lead at 63-56. Substitution watch: Clayton in for Berry with 2:56 left. Collins utilizes another TO subsequent to a trey from Chenery. Suddenly, both sides have found it from deep. Give Buie space at your own risk. He answers right back and is up to 20 points. Dan Petcash hits a three to cut the lead to five. 3:35 to go. Langborg drops it off perfectly to Barnhizer, who converts. Eight-point lead for the 'Cats. Collins calls timeout, as the 'Cats haven't scored a field goal in 5:14 of play. Still, they hold a 56-50 lead with 4:17 to go. Barnhizer up to 12 points and 12 rebounds, so we have our first double-double of the year. 56-50 following the second Barnhizer make. Binghamton calls timeout after the first make from Barnhizer. 55-50 lead for the 'Cats with 5:45 left. Following a steal by Nicholson, it'll be another trip to the stripe for Barnhizer. Harried was incredulous of the call. Barnhizer hits both, and is up to 10 points. Barnhizer will head to the line after getting fouled. Walker makes one of two shots. 52-50 Wildcats with 6:38 left. A shove by Langborg puts Binghamton in the bonus. Now, Buie picks up his fourth foul. Clayton will come in for No. 0. Buie called for an offensive foul. He's gone cold in the second half, and now has three fouls. It's 52-49 'Cats at the under-8.

Buie has 17, while Langborg has chipped in 13. Two misses from the Princeton transfer in space have kept this one close, but Northwestern is at least on the right side of the scoreboard. Barnhizer draws a charge. Northwestern's defense has looked significantly sharper in the second half. Strong finish at the cup by Chenery cuts the NU advantage to three with 8:38 left. Clayton assessed for his third foul, so he'll check out. Langborg has gotten white hot, hitting a jumper off the inbound. Northwestern now leads 52-47. We're in official review after the ball clanked off Barnhizer.

Binghamton hasn't scored in 3:04 of play, giving NU momentum that it's finally seized.

Langborg and Preston have combined for 17 points, seven rebounds, three blocks and a steal. Good beginning at Northwestern. Buie slow to get up after an awkward foul. Clayton coming in for him with 10:02 left. Buie goes strong for a layup after Torrence lost the handle. The lid has come off this place, with the stress temporarily relieved. Langborg sinks a turnaround J, and the Wildcats *finally* have the lead! The crowd is jumping at WRA. Preston with a huge swat! He's putting together a strong debut. Buie throws it away off the inbound, over the head of Langborg.

That kind of evening for the Wildcats. Preston forces a steal, and Benson is called for the take foul.

Should've counted the flip-in off the glass, imo At the under-12, it's 47-46 Binghamton.

Preston has poured in the last four points for NU, but the 'Cats still haven't gotten over the hump. They're running out of time to do so. Benson converts a tough fadeaway jumper, but Preston slams down a lob from Buie. It's 47-46 Binghamton. Barnhizer is 3-for-9 and has missed multiple times close to the rim. Not an ideal start. Preston cleans up a Clayton miss to make it 45-44. Langborg has checked back in, which is good news on the injury front. Off a tremendous cut through white defenders, Chenery finishes at the rim to augment the lead back to three. We're inside of 15 minutes left. Buie makes one of two.

Incredibly, the Wildcats still can't find a way to take the lead. Buie starts and stops to draw a foul. No. 0 will head to the line with an opportunity to tie the game. Seeing this Culver's promo is a great reminder that there needs to be one on campus  At the under-16, it's 43-41 Binghamton.

Only four made baskets so far in the second half. Wildcats still haven't led since it was 14-13. Barnhizer commits a questionable foul, and neither Collins nor the student section are pleased. Torrence finishes high off the glass to retain the Binghamton lead. He's up to 12. Clayton subs in for Langborg, who seemed to be limping off. Langborg follows up a missed Buie three, and the 'Cats have tied it up at 41-41. After four misses, Berry finally converts from deep. 41-39 now. Langborg misses an open corner three, and Torrence fights through two defenders to lay it in. 41-36 Bearcats. Nicholson misses both, but Berry exercises good effort to force a jump ball and keep the rock with NU. Nicholson pokes the ball away and is fouled on the other end on an alley-oop try, so No. 34 will head to the line. Nicholson already up to three blocks after a rejection. Binghamton inbounds, and the second half has begun. Notably, Ty Berry has played just six minutes so far.

He has two fouls and is 0-for-3 shooting.

Not the first 20 minutes he expected. HALF: Binghamton 39, Northwestern 36

Not the first half that anyone envisioned, to say the least.

Boo Buie has 14 points on 6-of-12 shooting, while Brooks Barnhizer and Ryan Langborg have posted eight and seven, respectively.

Binghamton has five players with 6+ points. Buie sinks a turnaround floater inside of 10 seconds left, but Binghamton gets a second-chance bucket to go before the buzzer. Nicholson finishes in the post after an assist by Buie. 1:16 left. Nehemiah Benson hangs tough for a jumper over Buie. Five-point lead for the Bearcats inside of two minutes left in the first half. Buie tries a spin but gets emphatically rejected by Chenery, who added a staredown. Still 35-32 Binghamton. Heads up play by Nicholson to throw it off the Binghamton defender following a Berry miss.

At the under-4 timeout, Binghamton still leads 35-32. The Wildcats have already turned it over seven times, and haven't led since it was 14-13. After a Chenery jumper, Langborg throws it away. Collins holds his arms up in frustration. Barnhizer converts both. The junior is up to eight points on the night, and the lead is just one. Barnhizer nets a filthy swat and draws contact going coast-to-coast. He'll shoot two and has a chance to make it a one-point affair. Buie patiently works his way to the basket to make it 33-30 Binghamton. He's up to 12. Langborg starting to feel it! He swishes a deep trey after crossing over his defender. It's 31-28 Binghamton. Langborg pulls up from the corner of the paint, but Harried cuts through the defense to keep the lead at six. Binghamton loses the handle, and that takes us to the under-8. It's 29-23 Bearcats over Wildcats.

Buie has 10 for NU, and Barnhizer has added six. But, nobody else has exceeded more than three points. Barnhizer lays it in on the jelly, and Buie hits from deep to make it a six-point game. Petcash adds two more FTs. Back to an 11-point lead for Binghamton. Binghamton in the bonus with 8:49 left in the half.

Yikes! Subsequent to a Nicholson block, Barnhizer works his way down low for two. 27-18 Binghamton. Binghamton hits two more from the stipe, and Nicholson is assessed for a travel.

Yeah. Northwestern basketball thus far The Bearcats swing it around in the far corner, and Petcash buries a three.

The lead has ballooned to nine for the visitors. 22-16 Binghamton after two free throws are good by Tymu Chenery. To make matters worse, Buie lost the handle on a feed. Barnhizer misses on one end, and Clayton is whistled for his second foul on the other. Now seven fouls for the 'Cats, and we've yet to hit 10 minutes of play. With one on the clock, Torrence banks in a wild three. He's up to eight points for the Bearcats. Ahead of tonight’s season opener, here’s how far our staff predicts the Wildcats will go this season.

""That's not in my lane,"" he said about the scandal. Braun: ""I'm excited for the challenge that's ahead.""

With the Big Ten West still in a topsy-turvy state, all eyes turn to Michigan-Penn State, which will go a long way in determining the outcome of the Big Ten. A strong showing from the freshmen contingent at Big Ten Championships should have men’s tennis optimistic for spring: College basketball is back!

Before tonight’s tip-off, find out where each Big Ten team stands amongst it’s conference rivals heading into the 2023-24 season. Northwestern didn’t get the No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament, but that might not be a bad thing. Sometimes, it’s better to work with a chip on your shoulder. As Northwestern men’s basketball starts its 2023-24 season tonight, the Wildcats will take the floor with one new face in their starting lineup: Ryan Langborg.

Learn what drives the Princeton transfer — even after his own success — from . A committee really said that this isn’t the No. 1 team in the country. Tomi sacking Bryce Young is actual proof that Northwestern > Bama It took almost 77 minutes for either team to score, but Northwestern finally broke through for the Big Ten crown. FINALLY. Northwestern wins the Big Ten Championship off a goal from Olivia Bent-Cole in double overtime. Northwestern has 17 corners. Maryland has 2. 75 minutes of field hockey has been played, and it is still scoreless. Onto quarter No. 6. Northwestern got its 13th corner of the day with 16 seconds left in the first overtime frame. It got its 14th with four seconds left but was unable to capitalize. Make that 11. Having watched Annabel Skubisz for four years, we know talent. Klebasko is a star. The 'Cats are up to 10 corners on today. Seven minutes in overtime have passed and the stalemate remains. This is just the third time ever the Big Ten Tournament was decided in overtime for field hockey. Overtime here we are. Eight corners and still no boards for the Wildcats. Five minutes left in regulation, and there is still no score. There was one green card in the first half. There have been four green cards and one yellow in the second half. Northwestern's only ever Big Ten Tournament win was in 2014, also against Maryland, also in Ann Arbor. Klebasko put on a show against the NU attack at the end. Still scoreless heading into the fourth quarter. Maryland first-year goalie Alyssa Klebaska stops Ilse Tromp's shot mid-air. Have to respect it. The Terps are up to three cards in just the third quarter, with Hope Rose drawing a yellow card. NU will enter the fourth still a player-up. Northwestern goes man-up as Maryland takes another green card with under five left in the third quarter. NU and Maryland both earn green cards from Lauren Wadas and Hannah Boss. Stile 0-0 almost halfway through the third frame. Ever hear that defense wins championships? ""We just need to finish in the circle and execute out corner,"" head coach Tracey Fuchs said. Scoreless at the midway point. With a minute left in the first half, Maryland gets its first penalty corner of the day. Olivia Bent-Cole is everywhere all at once. Northwestern gets its third corner, but one again, Maryland is able to halt the attacking push. A card on Maryland's Hannah Boss puts Northwestern a player up. Neither team has broken through yet, but the 'Cats have tallied five shots and two penalty corners, while the Terps have just one shot. No score after the first quarter. It's looking like it'll come down to a defensive battle in Michigan today. Nearing the end of the first quarter, there is still no score, as the 'Cats and Terps go back and forth. “Northwestern is a rather tenacious team that a) won’t give up and b) largely won’t get blown out against most opponents... However, those traits won’t fully manifest themselves unless they translate into wins,” writes . The Wildcats lost to the Wolverines for the second straight game, prematurely concluding their postseason chase. In 15 minutes, No. 1 Northwestern will take on No. 8 Maryland for the Big Ten Championship.",457,2023-11-05 16:47:54,2023-11-11 23:59:29
46,"For the final time in 2023, and probably for the last time in its current form, good night from Ryan Field. Northwestern pulled away from Rhode Island for a 72-61 victory in the Hall of Fame Tip-Off. Here’s how the action unfolded: FINAL: NU 72, Rhode Island 61

Northwestern set the tone offensively in the second half, and pulls away from URI to go start 4-0 and set up a date with Mississippi State tomorrow afternoon. 

Three scorers in double figures: Barnhizer (18), Buie (16), Berry (13). Langborg had 9. With about two minutes to go, a big three and strip from Berry, as well as a one-legged fadeaway from Barnhizer, have Northwestern sitting comfortably with a 66-52 lead and 2:18 to go.

Northwestern looks like it's in prime position to start off 4-0. That concludes today's pressers. Mueller on the young guys getting an extra month of bowl prep: ""Getting an extra month to spend with this team and these guys is awesome."" Porter: ""It's a long game. Defense, they make adjustments. We make adjustments as well."" Porter on the HAT: ""First and foremost, understanding the history of the game. How important it is for the university.""

Talked about a ""bitter taste"" last year. Mueller on playing with Braun as the full-time HC: ""Not a huge difference. We bought in to playing for him the rest of the season beforehand. We knew he was going to be there for us."" Porter on differences from 2021-22: ""I think as a leadership group, it's been a very big point on making sure that we're doing the little things right. Attacking each day with the mindset to get better. Practice habits turn into game habits."" Mueller said he thought Purdue may have kicked, but that the team was ""definitely was ready for it."" Mueller on the field-storming: ""I thought they were going to take the goal posts down. It's good to be in the higher win column."" Mueller on goal-line stands: ""We knew we've done that before. Nothing changed. That's always the goal.""

Stressed ""complementary football."" Mueller noted that McGarigle talked to the unit about ""sending the seniors off the right way.""

Porter: ""As a group and as a team, we made a choice. Coming together. Understanding that every week is another opportunity to stay together."" Mueller on dealing with a dual-threat QB: ""We knew Card was a good runner, but a little bit less. Definitely a different challenge. Wasn't anything crazy.""

Talked about dealing with Heinrich Haarberg in Lincoln. Porter on Senior Day/playing the last game at Ryan Field: ""It's hard to really explain how it feels. Currently, still taking everything in. It's a blessing. This is an awesome place."" Mueller on his game-winning interception: ""That was awesome.""

Stressed LBs coach Tim McGarigle for helping preview that formation. MBB: Under-8 now, with Northwestern leading 59-48. Buie now at 11 points in the half. He's led a resurgent NU offense, which is holding off a great URI shooting display (5-of-6 from deep). 

The 'Cats are already in the bonus with 7:41 to play. Mueller on making stands: ""That's a huge emphasis for us. If we don't allow them to get in the end zone, they can't win."" Porter on his day: ""Offensive line was playing their butts off. Crease was there; was able to hit."" Xander Mueller and Cam Porter at the podium. That wraps up Bryant and Johnson. Johnson on the defense: ""It gives us a ton of confidence. It allows us to play a little more free."" Bryant on taking care of the ball: ""That was just really dumb by me. I didn't look off the safety. He read it well. Taking care of the ball is super important."" Bryant on student support: ""It's meant so much. Obviously, you want the support of the students. It was really cool to see us supporting them all game. It was just a really cool way to finish it off."" Johnson on scoring in three straight: ""I think just work. Constant work. Coming into practice every day. Finding ways to continuously get better throughout the year.""

Talked about continuing to ""go up the hill"" and avoiding a ""peak."" MBB: Under-12: Northwestern leads 53-39. 

The offenses have begun to erupt. It seems like both teams have constantly answered each other with buckets these last few possessions... NU is shooting a sparkling 9-of-12 through eight minutes, and Buie has 7 in the half. Bryant on playing Illinois: ""Illinois never recruited me in high school, so I'm excited to show them what I can do."" Johnson on Braun having the tag removed: ""It means a lot to me. He's one of the best, if not the best, that I've had in my time.""

Praised the ""voice he brings"" and his ""confidence.""

""You can tell that he loves us."" Johnson on staying locked in for the finale: ""We don't have to have a lot of conversations. It's Rivalry Week."" Bryant on winning two straight: ""Being able to handle success. It felt like after we lose a game, we'd come back in the next week and have a great week of practice. This week, it felt like we had that same mentality."" Bryant on how he feels: ""I feel good. I feel great. I'm ready to go for Illinois."" Bryant on dealing with pressure: ""I don't think there was much adjustments. We said we were going to call some different things. Throw it up to this guy [Johnson]. I think the O-line did a lot better."" Bryant called Senior Day a ""poetic ending"" living close to Evanston, and growing up watching NU. Johnson said Senior Day was ""definitely special.""

""This has been one of my favorite places I've been."" Bryant: ""Our defense has been playing phenomenal. That just gives us so much confidence to go out there and play loose."" Bryant says that he and the team ""talked all week"" about Purdue's safety blitzes. Johnson on overcoming drops: ""It was definitely lingering throughout the game.""

Mentioned the touchdown helping erase it. Bryant on playing in a bowl game: ""College goes by so quick. Now, it's about to be over. I'm super happy that we have that opportunity.""

""For me, it's something that is super special,"" Johnson said, noting an injury his freshman year. Johnson said he ""definitely could have"" anticipated having success.

""I had nothing but belief that we would do this."" Bryant on his play today: ""I think there were some good things, but definitely some things I would want back. I'm super picky about myself. I can't turn a win into a loss."" Ben Bryant and Cam Johnson now at the podium. That concludes Braun's media availabilty. Braun mentioned a ""couple missed fits...that really hurt us."" Braun on not having a QB spy: ""How they were doing things formationally was smart. Credit to them. There were certainly some adjustments, not only at halftime, but also throughout the second half.""

Mentioned avoiding the scrambling hitting downhill, with mixed results. Braun on Ben Bryant: ""I think he started to get comfortable and make quick decisions. You also have to credit the people around him. You got to credit Purdue. Ryan is a hell of a ball coach."" Braun on defensive versatility: ""It allows you to be diverse in your play-calling. You're just trusting your guys to go play fast, play with great leverage.""

Talked about discussions with NFL scouts.

""They're darn good football players."" MBB: Under-16 has hit in the second half, with NU up 43-30. The 'Cats have started the second half well, with Barnhizer and Buie each hitting threes. 

Barnhizer, at 13 points and seven boards, is on double-double watch, which feels like the most inevitable thing ever. Braun said that a ""unique opportunity"" was needed to remove him from North Dakota State, and that's what he got at Northwestern. Braun on his family: ""It's all that matters. It's those people back home, and it's our student-athletes. All the other stuff is just stuff on the periphery."" Braun on Senior Day: ""For us to have our last game here in the old Ryan Field, go down like this with securing bowl eligibility, is really special.""

Noted that such a day is ""hard,"" and praised the team for ""resetting."" Braun on running in the first vs. second half: ""There's some adjustments. The other component of it is just staying the course. Trusting the run game.""

Mentioned the need to ""lean into efficiency,"" which ""leads to explosiveness."" Braun said that, in some ways, fourth-down stops are ""as good as"" a turnover. Braun on the team's defense: ""I think we've embodied what great defense looks like. To us here at Northwestern, it's not the play-call. It's not some crazy ideas and game-planning.""

Talked about leverage, fundamentals and tackling, plus takeaways. Said the OL did a good job of ""anchoring in.""

Called the Cam Johnson touchdown ""incredible recognition"" by Ben Bryant. Braun on offensive line improvement throughout the game: ""I think those two things [run game and OL] really complement each other.""

Lauded Purdue's defensive structure, based in man and Tampa 2.

""They're going to pin them back up front, and try to take advantage."" Braun called the team an ""energetic group"" postgame. Braun on maintaining focus with bowl eligibility: ""I don't want to take anything for granted, but I hope it's easy with the Land of Lincoln Trophy on the line.""

Stressed ""staying laser-focused."" Braun on the first half imbalance: ""That's team football.""

Mentioned the team ""finding ways to stay in games"" throughout the season, pointing to against Minnesota.

""We've got to continue to lean into that."" Braun on if he envisioned going bowling: ""Absolutely. At Big Ten Media Day, we talked about the goals and aspirations of what this group could do. I don't blame anyone, but I would be lying if there weren't eye rolls. It's a reflection of these young men."" Braun said he'd refrain from commenting on if students should have laked the post after the win. Braun on students storming the field: ""It's so cool. We've talked about it before in words. We've talked about the student experience. That's it embodied. It's awesome. That's what college athletics is all about: bringing a community together."" Braun on his first game without the interim tag: ""I don't know if it felt different. To be honest with you, I don't know if this will all completely sink in until the offseason.""

Noted players' reactions after the win as being telling. Braun on the play of seniors: ""I think that's a reflection of what development really looks like. Guys that have really stayed the course.""

Talked about Cam Porter's ability to overcome injuries, and Xander Mueller's growth. Braun: ""I can't tell you how overwhelmed with joy I am that this team has an opportunity to extend its season, get an extra game.""

Noted that the ""task is not done."" Braun: ""A credit to Purdue. They battled. They did some really good things offensively. Moved the ball quite a bit effectively. Yards don't result in wins; points do.""

Praised the defense for not breaking. Braun's opening statement: ""Definitely speechless this time. Been an incredible week in so many ways.""

Mentioned the focus being on Purdue today despite being named head coach.

""I think it's an absolute reflection of just this team's maturity."" HALF: NU 33, Rhode Island 26

Raining on the parade at home, Northwestern’s 22-2 lead gets significantly cut, punctuated by a half-ending foul by Buie on a URI three.

NU is shooting just 35% from the field despite going 40% from three. Barnhizer leads with 10 on 2-of-9. Cam Porter’s big day, combined with strong goal-line defense, propelled Northwestern to its sixth win. David Braun set to speak to the media shortly. Purdue Pete may haunt you in your sleep, but he clearly didn’t spook the Wildcats.  Northwestern fans storm the field after the team's sixth win in maybe its final game ever at Ryan Field. FINAL: Northwestern 23, Purdue 15

It was a lot closer than it should've been, but the Wildcats are officially bowl eligible.

Cam Porter (95 yards, two touchdowns) and Cam Johnson (88 yards, a score) helped lead the team to victory. Mueller picks off Browne, and that's it! Northwestern will win!! Heard stops Tracy in his tracks. Third-and-two upcoming, but the clock stops because of a Purdue injury.

28 seconds left after a 10-second run-off. Ball is at the Northwestern 34. Miller is tackled in bounds, and the clock is running. Under a minute left. MBB: With under four minutes left in the half, Rhode Island has put a dent into NU's lead with an 8-0 (and 15-4) run. It's 26-17 NU.

The highlight of that stretch was a powerful block from Tyson Brown, who STUFFED Jordan Clayton and jumpstarted a Zek Montgomery fastbreak layup. Browne locates Jaron Tibbs for seven. Then, Browne scampers out of bounds for another first down.

Purdue driving, at the Northwestern 42. 1:13 left. Browne races past Heard for a first down. Purdue at its own 48 with 1:34 left. Miller secures a fluttering pass for a gain of five. Renner's punt slows down at the Purdue 38, where the Boilermakers will have it.

Eight-point game. 1:59 to go. Boilermaker ball. What does Northwestern's defense have as an answer? Porter is well short of the marker. Renner will punt, and Purdue will get the ball back down eight with over two minutes to go. Porter makes a jump cut and gets four. Purdue is now out of timeouts, and will deal with a third-and-6 on the other end of the short break. Porter loses his footing on first, and Purdue utilizes its second timeout. Second-and-10 upcoming with 3:02 to go. Freehill's kick lands in the end zone for a touchback. Terrific design by Purdue building off the toss. Burks gets the reverse and sprints for two.

It's 23-15 Northwestern with 3:06 left. Not done yet. As if things couldn't get any better. Mockobee is in for six on a toss. It's 23-13 Northwestern, and Purdue will go for two. Mueller and Turner converge on Browne, and, wouldn't you know: it's another fourth-and-goal for Purdue.

Walters uses his first timeout of the second half. Biggest play of the day upcoming. Gallagher helps corral Browne. Purdue facing another third-and-goal situation, down 16 with 3:25 to go. Browne muscles his way down to the 3-yard line on a keeper. Tracy runs straight downhill past a cavalcade of black, and has a gain of 57. Garnett Hollis Jr. tracked him down at the 8. Browne links with Burks to set up third-and-2. Browne collects two on first down. Under 5:30 to go. With the ball at the Purdue 48, Bryant's throw for Kirtz is undercut by Thieneman for an interception.

Don't fully understand throwing in that situation. Ball goes back to Purdue. MBB: At the under-12, it's 16-2 Northwestern. Barnhizer punctuates what is now a 10-0 run with a three as the shot clock expires.

Rhode Island is a staggering 1-OF-13 from the field, and has turned it over four times. Tyus is short on third down, but an unsportsmanlike conduct call on Purdue's Antonio Stevens keeps it Northwestern ball.

Unreal blunder by the Boilermakers. Karlaftis makes the tackle on Tyus on second, bringing up third-and-5. Tyus is wrestled down for a minimal gain on first. Browne looks deep, but Theran Johnson had terrific position to knock it away! The 'Cats get off the field, up 23-7 with 7:49 to go.

You can smell bowl eligibility. Mockobee gets seven, and it's fourth-and-10. Might be game. MBB: We're at the under-16, and Chris Lowery has taken his defensive talents out east. 'Cats lead 9-2, and have forced Rhode Island to start just 1-of-8 from the field. 

Buie leads all scorers with 5, including an impressive three-pointer in a defender's face. Browne angles outside for three, and it'll be third-and-17 Purdue from the Northwestern 34. False start on Purdue's Mahamane Moussa will spot the ball at the Northwestern 37. Adeyi puts a stop to a quick Purdue pass to Tracy. Loss of two. On third-and-2, Tracy has enough for the first down. Inside of 10 minutes to go, and Purdue is threatening. Browne keeps it in his hands and gets six. Browne dumps it off to Mockobee, who churns for 15 yards. Boilermakers at the Northwestern 44. Browne scoots for 12 yards on first, and Mockobee follows it up with 11.

Jaheem Joseph, involved on the stop, slowly walking off the field. A hold on the runback puts Purdue at its 18. MBB: Elsewhere, Northwestern men's basketball has just tipped off against Rhode Island at the Hall of Fame Tip-Off in Uncasville, Connecticut. Very occasional updates from us until football wraps up.

Starters: Buie, Berry, Langborg, Barnhizer, Nicholson. Olsen converts the XP. Wildcats lead 23-7 with 12:08 to go. Porter is left wide alone, and races untouched to the end zone! It's his second touchdown of the day.

Kirtz got into a scuffle with Derrick Rogers Jr., but the score counts. Bryant overshoots Kirtz, who ran a comeback. Bryant expected the fade. Porter rushes for three on first down. NU goes back to Porter, who works his way up the gut for a new set of downs. NU at the Purdue 37 with 13 minutes left in this ballgame, looking to tack on to a nine-point lead. Porter collects nine on the next play. Bryant stands tall and hits Johnson DEEP for a 25-yard gain. What a pickup for the 'Cats. Bryant steps up in the pocket but is off target to Johnson. It's third-and-6 for NU. A.J. Henning is questionable to return with an upper-body injury, per Northwestern Athletics. Explains why we didn't see him on last the punt return. End of the third: Northwestern 16, Purdue 7

Still a sloppy one here from Ryan Field, but the Wildcats were lifted by a 52-yard catch-and-run from Cam Johnson.

One quarter left to enjoy this wild one (and this glorious stadium, in all likelihood). Porter veers for a gain of four, with Thieneman making another stop. Kirtz makes a fair catch on the punt. No A.J. Henning this time. Meredith tries to hit Sheffield along the sideline, but the receiver couldn't get a foot in. The Boilermakers will punt. Pate works upfield to stop Tracy. It's third-and-5 Boilermakers as the third nears a close. Jaylen Pate wraps up Meredith for no gain. Olsen's kick is out of bounds, and it's another special teams mistake.

Purdue will start at its 35. Touchdown, Northwestern!

Bryant hits Johnson on a curl route, and the receiver did the rest on YAC for a 52-yard score.

It's 16-7 'Cats. Himon makes one Boilermaker miss before getting only two. Wildcats at their 48. Mike Bajakian dials up a fake screen, then a real one to Himon. The RB works downfield for a gain of 14. Himon gets tripped up after netting four. Henning fumbles the kickoff after running it back, but Braden Turner picks it up. Near disaster. Tracy bobs and weaves through multiple Wildcats, and Purdue has finally gotten on the board.

It's 9-7 Northwestern with 3:59 to go in the third. Michael Kilbane helps bring down Browne for a tackle for loss. Purdue at the Wildcats' 20 with four minutes left in the third. Purdue going tempo, and Mockobee has more than enough for the first down. He hurdles a defender all the way down to the NU 19. Browne runs a draw for seven, which sets up third-and-3 from the Northwestern 33. Browne throws outside for Jayden Dixon-Veal on first. Browne looks to Mockobee down the seam, who hangs on through the contact. Purdue all the way down to the Northwestern 40 after the 26-yard pitch and catch. Ball stays with Mockobee, who collects only two. It's third-and-6 for the Boilermakers, trailing by nine. Browne finds Mockobee for a gain of two, and a big hit by Heard follows. Browne keeps the rock and runs off tackle for a gain of 12. Devin Turner with the stick. Tracy bobbles Jack Olsen's kickoff but recovers and runs it out to the 18. Olsen makes from 30, and the Wildcats lead 9-0 with 7:38 left in the third quarter. Thieneman halts Henning on third, and Northwestern will elect to kick on fourth-and-1 from the Purdue 12.

David Braun opting for the conservative choice. Bryant looks to Tyus on a wheel route, but the pressure affected the throw. The 'Cats have third-and-6 from the Purdue 17. Henning gets the carry and tries to work back, but Dillon Thieneman cuts him down for just four. Sheffield drops Renner's punt, and the Wildcats recover! Greyson Metz got on it, and NU is at the Purdue 21. Bryant looks to Johnson outside, but it's incomplete.

Northwestern is 3-for-10 on third down. A stark difference from a week ago. Bryant dumps it off to Porter, and it's third-and-11 Wildcats. Porter picks up three to set up second-and-12. The 'Cats have 18 carries for 20 yards today, factoring in sacks. A Josh Priebe false start immediately moves the ball back. Bryant locates Henning in the flat, and the senior surges ahead for a first down.

At long last, some offensive production! Kydran Jenkins meets Porter immediately on second, and it's third-and-8 Northwestern. Great breakup by Purdue's Markevious Brown to knock the ball away from Johnson on first. Watching Northwestern and Purdue play today Ansell's rocket of a punt trickles into the end zone. On third, Meredith scrambles, but a sea of black jerseys swallows him up.

Neither team has scored since the 11:40 mark of the first quarter. Meredith hits Miller for a loss of two. Seemed like weird timing on the manipulation. It's third-and-7 for Purdue. Jaheem Joseph tracks down a Tracy toss for a gain of five. Renner's punt is downed at the 37, where Purdue will begin the second half. Bryant throws wide of Henning on third, and it's six straight drives with no points for NU. Bryant finds Henning for a gain of 12, and it'll bring up third-and-4. A hold on Johnson negates a screen to Henning, making it second-and-16. Porter starts the second half with a four-yard gain on a split zone. Ben Freehill's kick is fair caught by Henning for a touchback, and the second half is underway. Just under 1,000 miles away from the action currently unfolding at Ryan Field, Northwestern men’s basketball will tip off a back-to-back. Here’s what’s on the line for the ‘Cats: HALF: Northwestern 6, Purdue 0

The Wildcats' defense bent but didn't break on multiple occasions, including stopping the Boilermakers from the 1. But, NU has plenty to clean up, having surrendered five sacks already. Olsen misses the 38-yarder wide right. Just his second miss of the year.

That type of bizarre game so far. Bryant is sacked for the fifth time, and the 'Cats spike the ball with nine seconds left. Jack Olsen will come on for the kick. Bryant hits Cam Johnson for a gain of five, and NU utilizes its last timeout with 24 seconds left. Browne looks deep, but Garnett Hollis Jr. undercuts it for the pick! Wildcats have the ball at the Purdue 20. Great play in the Cover 2 defense by the CB. Renner has a beautiful punt downed by Ray Niro III. Purdue will start at its 2 with 35 seconds to go.

It's third-and-18 from the Purdue 36 with 49 seconds left. Yanni Karlaftis dumps Bryant, and Braun calls TO. Third sack for the Boilermakers, and the 'Cats are at the PU 36 with 55 seconds left. Bryant looks deep down the far side to Kirtz, who adjusts to make the catch! NU at the Purdue 28 after the 20-yard gain. Bryant gets decked on what arguably should've been a late hit, but he's staying in the game. It's third-and-4. Bryant throws outside the numbers to get four from Kirtz. Richie Hagarty scooped it up for NU, and the Wildcats will start at their 40. But, it's another Purdue mistake! Botched handoff goes right back to the Wildcats. Wow.

Sheffield at the 31. 2:51 left in this half, and Northwestern is clinging to a 6-0 lead. Bryant escapes on third down, but Kane cuts him down short. Renner will punt for the third straight drive, and the Wildcats' offense remains stagnant since the opening possession. Porter picks up four to set up third-and-7 from the NU 32. Porter runs to the right but loses one. Omonode is having a game for Purdue. Northwestern uses play action and finds Kirtz crossing wide open across the middle. Gain of 28, and gets NU out of its own end zone. Correction: Tracy was short. Mockobee is SHORT after multiple attempts, and Northwestern has survived yet again!

This is unbridled Big Ten West football. Braun calls timeout to talk things over before the fourth-and-goal play with 5:39 to go in the first half. Tracy is *just* short, and Walters will roll the dice once more on fourth. Burks gets the ball on a touch pass, and Garnett Hollis Jr. sets the edge beautifully. Loss of one, and it's third-and-goal. Browne rolls right, then back left, and scoots down to the half-yard line. First-and-goal Purdue from the 1. Call stands. Purdue retains the ball.

Of note, the Wildcats were trotting out their second- and third-string receivers for most of this drive. With nobody open, Bryant is dumped by Mo Omonode. Wildcats at their own 4. Joseph Himon II angles outside, but a hold on Preston Bacon backs the ball back to the 11. Xander Mueller DETONATES on Tracy, and Purdue doesn't get it. The Wildcats' defense bends but doesn't break. Aidan Hubbard stuffs the run attempt, and Walters will go for it on fourth-and-2 from the 15. Now marked short after review. It's third-and-inches for Purdue from the Northwestern 14. Yes. Six wins means you're automatically bowl eligible. Tracy bounces the run outside to barely get the first down. Run was nearly blown up from the start, but another miss. Tracy gets the flip from Meredith for nine. Purdue at the Northwestern 14. And, in classic Ryan Field fashion, the student section has readily filled up by the end of the first quarter. End of the first quarter: Northwestern 6, Purdue 0

The Wildcats' looked unstoppable through two drives, but the Boilermakers have answered. Two impressive drives by PU to get deep into NU territory has this game feeling close. On fourth, Walters keeps his O on the field, and Tracy gets just enough for the first down. Meredith steps up and runs for 12 on third down, facing pressure by Saka.

With multiple rushers in his face, Bryant flips it to Porter, who rumbles for 11! Tremendous play by the NU QB. Bryant finds Bryce Kirtz on a slant for five. Third-and-5 now. Bryant overshoots everyone on first down. Looked like miscommunication. Ben Freehill's kick is short, and Purdue comes up empty. Still 7-0 'Cats with 7:14 left in the first. Browne scrambles to the Northwestern 27, and Ryan Walters will send out the kicking unit. Browne puts his foot in the ground and gains four, setting up third-and-16 from the Wildcats' 36.

Xander Mueller and Bryce Gallagher greet Tracy Jr. to start the game. Gain of only two. Tyrone Tracy Jr. returns Henry Helms' kick to the Purdue 28. With Pat and Shirley Ryan standing by as honorary captains, Northwestern wins the toss and defers.

We'll see the Hudson Card-less Boilermakers on O to start. For maybe the ever time from Ryan Field, the Northwestern student section at kickoff: Northwestern honoring Matt Ulrich with a moment of silence before the game. Senior Day festivities are kicking off here from Ryan Field. Still 15 minutes to kickoff. The Boilermakers will be without their starting QB and a key defender at Ryan Field. With a new stadium plan on the verge of approval, Saturday looks like the final matchup at this version of Ryan Field.

Before its grand finale,  pens a tribute to the venue and recalls generations of football memories. Our staffers tend to think that the Wildcats will beat the Boilermakers for the first time since 2020. Before the ‘Cats take on Purdue, take a look back at Ben Bryant’s magnificent return last Saturday in Madison. National title games have become a standard for Northwestern field hockey. Also, looks like we might get special patriotic end zones.

If you're keeping track at home, Northwestern football will have worn black jerseys in four of its six games at Ryan Field this year. ""Our team has a mentality of we are going to get opportunities either way....even if we lose the ball we have nine, 10 people who are going to help us out. That mentality has been great,"" said Marshall. ""Our defense has been so, so good this year,"" said Fuchs. ""Defense starts with the forward. It's definitely a team effort."" ""They have come in and been like sophomores or juniors,"" Fuchs said of Olivia Bent-Cole and Ilse Tromp. ""Those guys definitely add to such an experienced team with Alia, Skubisz, Wadas, I could go on."" ""We've honed on it all year,"" said Marshall of the defense. ""Making big tackles outside of the circle."" ""Really proud of the team and all the sacrifice they have put in over the past five years to get to Sunday,"" said head coach Tracey Fuchs.

Here’s how to follow along as Northwestern field hockey takes on Duke in the Final Four. Our staffers took a shot at predicting the NCAA Field Hockey Final Four. (Of course it’s unanimous, because did you really expect otherwise?): Explaining the decision to hire David Braun. Sharing favorite Ryan Field memories. Talking about bowl game destinations.

The latest episode of Pound the Talk had it all. After three seasons in Evanston, Russell Payne has men’s soccer trending up, but there’s plenty of work to be done to keep the team heading in the right direction. Read everything David Braun, Michael Schill and Derrick Gragg had to say yesterday at Braun’s introductory press conference right here: That's all from Braun, Gragg and Schill. Braun on reshaping the program: ""I think we've had a similar conversation about the defense when we first arrived here. It's not about putting my stamp on it, at the end of the day, it's not my program, it's Northwestern's and our players."" Braun on  what he's learned about himself the last few months: ""I'm at my best when I'm rooted in my purpose, when I'm rooted in my faith, and I know who I answer to: my God."" More: ""One of the gifts I've ever earned is an opportunity to win a national championship at NDSU. But you quickly realize after that experience that all is fulfilled completely. You better know your purpose. The opportunities that have come have come from walking in purpose."" Braun on his long-term coaching vision: ""I wanted to be the head coach at a Big Ten institution. That was my dream."" Gragg on when he decided on Braun: ""The timing on it, the president and myself... we wanted to relieve the pressure of what Coach was mentioning. We've been talking about this all season. I made the decision, but I had a lot of people to consult with."" Braun on when he felt like he'd become the head coach: ""Call me crazy, but it was like, wake up each morning, what do I need to do today to figure out what I need to do each day to get ready for Saturday.

""Honestly, it didn't become a reality until mid-week this week."" Braun on when he learned he'd be the interim in July: ""Don't know if it was something I was excited about, but honored to have an opportunity to be with these guys. I learned that there's a tremendous opportunity to have an impact on every person in the program."" Braun on celebrating: ""There wasn't much celebrating other than getting ready for Purdue, but there were certainly moments back at home.""

Said the biggest celebration came at home with his sons when his sons said, ""We're not moving!"" Braun on what the players' support meant to him: ""The support from our guys... it's why we do what we do. For these guys. It's not just the locker room in Madison, it's the way these guys showed up every single day."" Braun concludes his statement. Q&A portion has begun. Braun: ""You want to talk about the character of a team? All you've got to do is look at this group right now.""

He notes a desire to use that character to ""change the college football landscape"" and ""out-team"" everyone in the country. Braun briefly mentions long-term goals, then follows up with: ""All I care about is having a great Thursday and beating Purdue."" ""They've rooted back into their purpose: the young men that sit here today."" Braun thanks the staff.

""Character is revealed in difficult times. I've been unfortunate enough to be part of a staff that's been let go at UC Davis, and fortunate enough to be part of a staff that's won national championships [at NDSU]."" More: ""Myself and our family know that the opportunity that exists for our family only exists because of you guys, and your willingness to buy in, and galvanize, and come together, and embody what this program is all about."" Braun thanks the players: ""Words won't do it justice.""

Said it was hard leaving NDSU and the relationships he made there, but ""blown away by the quality of young men that make up this program."" Braun: ""When this transition occurred during the summer, my wife eight months pregnant. We talk about not flinching... Kristin Braun never flinched."" Braun thanks his family. ""Not just the last few months but the last 10 years."" Gragg: ""He's shown tremendous leadership under these adverse circumstances and he embodies respect, integrity and excellence.""

Noted Braun's body language, interactions w/ players, postgame messages. Said there was a ""We Want Braun"" chant in the locker room after Wisconsin. Gragg: ""Would I ask this coach to lead and support my own children? Anyone who's done this knows we don't always get it right, but we certainly got it right this time."" Gragg thanks Braun's family for their sacrifice. He also thanked the student-athletes and the coaches for their resilience:

""I lost my coach senior year, and that pales in comparison to what they've gone through."" Gragg now at the podium. Before handing the microphone off to Derrick Gragg, Schill noted that ""he deserves a big thank-you"" for playing ""an integral role"" in bringing Braun to Northwestern and helping make the decision to remove the interim tag. Schill: ""Dave I'm so proud to have you a part of the Wildcats family. I'm so proud of what our football team, our student athletes have accomplished this season."" Schill: ""In the face of adversity, [Braun] has set an example for all of us that living our values as a university is a successful pathway to success by any standard."" Schill noted that he particularly saw Braun's leadership qualities observing him in the season opener at Rutgers. Schill: ""Big Ten football is under a microscope. But Dave came into a particularly difficult situation, and never wavered in his commitment to you."" Schill: ""[Braun] has shown what it means to be a leader by acting as a resource for his student-athletes, by modeling incredible humility and by showing them that he is here to support them, to support you, in every phase of your development and all of the way."" Schill: ""I am so happy to be celebrating the news that all of you have seen by now, that effectively former interim head coach David Braun will become the Jones Family Head Coach of the Northwestern Wildcats!""

Met by applause. Northwestern's introductory press conference for David Braun has begun.  Michael Schill will talk first, followed by Derrick Gragg, followed by David Braun. Here at Ryan Fieldhouse, where David Braun is set to be formally introduced as Northwestern's 30th head coach. Stay tuned for updates! Northwestern swim and dive might not be a top-ten program right now, but new head coach Rachel Stratton-Mills has plans to make success happen.

From  — dive into the philosophies of the former Arizona State associate head coach. There’s plenty to address after Northwestern’s large loss to No. 16 Notre Dame. In their 11th game of the season, the Wildcats look to put together two wins — and clinch bowl eligibility.

Here’s what Northwestern will have to do to take down Purdue. Take a look at the teams who will challenge Northwestern’s quest to 22 straight victories and a championship. Northwestern football answered its most important long-term question yesterday by naming David Braun its head coach.

But, as  explores, there’s a lot more to settle — as soon as next week, and especially in the upcoming months. The ‘Cats allowed 110 points in Notre Dame’s home-opener: FINAL: Notre Dame 110, Northwestern 52.

A very forgettable outing for the 'Cats, who turned the ball over 25 times and shot 34% from the field. Notre Dame has eclipsed 100 points.

The Irish lead by 57 with a little under three minutes to play. The Irish won't let up. 

With eight minutes left in the contest and up 41, most of ND's starters are still in. In 2022, Northwestern lost by 34 to Notre Dame: 92-58.

The 'Cats currently trail by 37: 79-42. 

Can they crawl back in the fourth quarter to best their showing from last season? Notre Dame has scored a buzzer beater in every quarter tonight. Wow. A very slow third quarter comes to an end, as the Fighting Irish lead the 'Cats, 79-42.

In 10 minutes, we saw 12 fouls, two hard hits and three team timeouts. Paige Mott is subbed in and fouls out 13 seconds later.

She entered tonight leading the B1G in rebounds/game, but couldn't collect any against ND. McWilliams puts up an attempt that's blocked, but she's able to grab her own rebound and convert on a second-chance layup. Things keep getting uglier for the 'Cats.

After Maddy Westbeld collects an offensive board for the Irish, she's fouled by Jasmine McWilliams. 

After sinking both free throws, ND is up 70-32. Hailey Weaver nabs her third three of the day. She leads all NU scorers tonight (11). Mott gets called for an intentional foul, which sends Hidalgo to the line and gives ND the ball back.

Certainly not the start to the half that McKeown was hoping for. (Not so) Fun fact: NU hasn't shot a free throw all night. Worth noting that last year's contest between these two teams featured technicals and ejections. Paige Mott sets a MEAN screen on Hidalgo that's called for her fourth foul of the night.

The refs are going to review it for a potential higher-level foul. Daley gets the spark going, opening scoring for the second half.

She has 10 points on 5-for-13 shooting tonight. ND misses its first shot of the third quarter. Good vibes incoming. Kicking off the third quarter, and it looks like ND gained a point during halftime. Refs must've upgraded an Irish jumper to a three-pointer during the break. 

We'll kick off the half with the 'Cats trailing by 30. Through 20 minutes, the killer has been turnovers for Joe McKeown's unit.

NU has given it away 15 times to ND's nine. Three TOs for the 'Cats in the final 3:25 of the half. Make that a 12-0 run — forgot to include the last-second jumper. Insult to injury: Citron hits another buzzer-beater to end the half.

The Irish end the half on a 10-0 run, and NU will head to the locker room down by 29. The Irish are *flying* right now. Gotta respect the pace.

They've used it to nearly double-up Northwestern — 51-26 with 1:07 left in Q2. Back-to-back layups from Notre Dame makes it 47-26. Impressive sequence as Prosper and Weaver trade threes. 

43-26, ND. Daley misses a jumper and McWilliams misses the follow-up off the ORB.

Got to connect on the second-chance opportunities if NU wants to climb back into this. Paige Mott gets called for a shooting foul and sends Anna Dewolfe to the line.

Dewolfe makes both, and the Irish are up by 17 with 4:11 left in the first half. After Hidalgo and Daley trade buckets, Citron sinks a three to win the sequence.

36-21, ND. Out of the timeout, NU is called for an offensive foul. Ademusayo was moving on a screen. 

Not what the 'Cats needed to stop the ND momentum. Consecutive layups from ND extend the Irish lead to 12. McKeown calls a timeout to regroup.

Notre Dame is shooting 60% from the field so far while Northwestern is hitting on 39% of its shots. Hailey Weaver comes through and sinks a three.

The 'Cats needed that to keep up with a very quick Irish team.

27-19, ND. Hannah Hidalgo makes a transition layup on a fast break. 

27-16, ND. After grabbing an offensive rebound, KK Bransford is fouled by Caileigh Walsh. She goes 1-for-2 at the charity stripe.

25-16, ND. A hectic start to the second quarter.

Jasmine Mcwilliams turns it over to start the quarter for NU. Then, Natalija Marshall makes a bad pass for ND. *Then*, Casey Harter turns it over again for the 'Cats.

Geez. A momentum-shifting end to the first quarter.

Melannie Daley misses on a jumper for the 'Cats with 13 seconds left in the period. Sonia Citron then connects on a three as time expires, dampening what had been a small NU run.

Heading into Q2, the Irish lead by eight — 24-16. Sonia Citron ends the 'Cats' short run and sinks a jumper for ND.

21-16. Casey Harter turns a ND turnover into points for the 'Cats. 

19-16, Irish. Mercy Ademusayo makes a second-chance layup thanks to a ND turnover. 

Cuts the Irish's lead to five — 19-14. Notre Dame is pressing now. Kylee Watson grabs an offensive rebound and puts it back up, grabbing another bucket for the Irish. Brutal.

Now 19-12. Anna Dewolfe scores on a fastbreak for ND, making it 17-12. McKeown calls his first timeout of the night with 3:26 to go in Q1. 

NU has kept it close so far, down only three after about seven minutes of action. Back-to-back steals from Daley and Mott get the Wildcats back in it, as it’s now 15-12. A Caileigh Walsh foul sends ND to the line. 

Cassandre Prosper sinks both and extends the Irish lead — 15-8. Notre Dame is on a 13-0 run in the last 2:05. 

It’s now 13-8, Irish, with 5:02 left in the first. Just like that, Notre Dame takes the lead. 

A steal and a few threes later, the Irish are up by a couple in the middle of the first. Notre Dame nails a three out of a timeout to get on the board. 

8-3, ‘Cats. ‘Cats are cruising to kick off tonight’s action against the Irish. 

8-0 a few minutes into play. Tonight’s starting five versus No. 16 Notre Dame. It's official: Braun is here for the long haul: There it is. Northwestern confirms the earlier report by  that the full-time head coaching role will go to Braun. Per reports, Northwestern football has appeared to drop David Braun's interim tag — and there wasn’t much surprise. David Braun appears to have secured the full-time head coaching job. After taking over for Pat Fitzgerald as an interim in mid-July, Braun is set to become the program's 30th full-time head coach. Now in the home stretch, there’s still movement in the Big Ten Power Rankings: One win away from a guaranteed bowl game appearance, is it fair to think the ‘Cats are back? There’s plenty to glean following another nail-biter against a major underdog: That’s all for tonight’s availability. Buie on flushing the game: ""You flush it like you flush any other game. It doesn't matter if we won by 30 tonight, you have to move on and get ready for the next game."" Barnhizer on his defense: ""It's just listening to our coaches. We get steals out of our philosophy."" Buie on if he felt added pressure to score: ""No."" Buie on rebounding struggles: ""I didn't think we did a good job at finding bodies and blocking people out. That can't happen. It was something that was discussed."" Barnhizer on scoring 20: ""It felt good, but my head was in other places. I just wish we had played a more complete game."" Buie: ""We showed some toughness grinding the game out. I didn't think we started the game well and that set us back. We need to be better next game."" Boo Buie and Brooks Barnhizer now at the podium That'll be all for Collins. Collins on Mullins: ""He just has to stay ready. His time is coming."" Collins on getting the bigs going: ""We want those guys to be opportunistic.  We want them to continue to work. We wouldn't have had the season we had last year if Matt didn't play at a high level, so we need to help him get back to that."" Colins on scoring: ""We can't expect to win games with only Boo and Brooks scoring."" Collins on eking out a win: ""You always want to learn things while winning. If you don't come ready to compete every night, you can lose to anybody. We can lose to anybody. It was a step backward after a step forward."" Collins: ""I don't think we came into this game with the mindset of being physical. It has nothing to do with the size, it has all to do with mentality."" Collins on rebounding issue: ""It has nothing to do with the size. We're not boxing out. We're not clicking. We need our bigs to rebound. It's a collective effort."" Collins: ""It was one of those nights where the shots weren't falling, but that's part of basketball.""

Emphasized that Western Michigan deserves credit. Collins: ""We're very fortunate to win the game. I told them that they deserved to win the game. Everyone knows that we weren't playing well. We were able to make a couple shots and make enough stops to win the game. We have a lot of things to clean up defensively."" Chris Collins now at the podium Survive and advance. FINAL: Northwestern ekes out a 63-59 win over Western Michigan.

It was not pretty, but Buie and Barnhizer carry the Wildcats to a victory. Martinelli pokes it away, and Barnhizer corals it and is fouled.

7.4 seconds remaining. Langborg makes the second.

Two possession game. First free throw is good. Another offensive rebound for the Broncos, who convert it into a layup.

'Cats call a timeout up 61-59 with 20.6 seconds to play. Refs say last touched by NU. WMU's three bounces around the rim and out, but the Broncos aren't able to corral the long rebound in bounce.

'Cats clinging to a 61-57 lead with 46.8 seconds left. Kick ball probably saves a Broncos' basket.

Under a minute to play. Mad scramble for the ball finds Langborg, who drills a fadeaway as the shot clock expires.

Crowd getting into it as the 'Cats will try to hold on for the next 1:52. Buie chucks up a prayer, and it somehow goes, but WMU responds with a three.

59-57 NU with 2:22 to play. Barnhizer is denied at the rim, but flies across the floor to grab the loose ball.

Pure hustle from the junior. Preston gets called underneath for his third foul.

Western Michigan shooting from here on out. Northwestern has 15 rebounds in the game.

Western Michigan has 15 OFFENSIVE rebounds alone Tie game for a split second, but Buie responds with a big three.

Pick-and-roll game is killing NU. 'Cats catch a break on a bad pass by the Broncos.

NU clinging to a 54-52. It's again a one-point game. Northwestern's offense looks all out of sync.

Is Brian Ferentz calling this game? Langborg finally gets on the board with a layup to expand NU's lead to 53-47 with eight minutes to play. Barnhizer pokes it away and goes coast-to-coast for the easy layup.

He now has 20 for the first time in his career. Buie finally hits a triple, NU's first in nearly 15 minutes. It's a one-point game.

Broncos are on an 8-0 run and have possession at the under 12.

Northwestern is 4-21 from three today -- yikes. Another offensive board by WMU, its 12th.

For comparison, NU has 15 rebounds in total. Every time 'Cats get a bucket, the Broncos respond with one of their own.

44-38 Northwestern with 14:34 to play. Berry is fouled going up and will shoot two after the timeout.

'Cats clinging to a 40-33 lead. Nicholson picks up his third on what appeared to be a monster rejection.

Chris Collins did not agree with that one. Barnhizer has his first miss in six attempts.

I blame myself. Barnhizer with another and-one in transition, his third on the night.

Everything is falling for No.13 Second-half action underway.

Starting five out on the floor for NU. At the half: NU 35, WMU 27.

It has not been pretty for the Wildcats, shooting 22.2% from three and being outrebounded 25-11, but their star duo of Buie and Barnhizer have done just enough to give them a slight edge. Barnhizer with another and-one with 3.3 seconds left in the half.

He has 13 points in the first half alone. Ryan Langborg is 0-6 in the first half.

Berry will come in to replace him with under a minute to go. Buie has two straight triples rim in and out.

Just brutal. NU is now 4-13 from beyond the arc tonight, but multiple shots have rattled in and out.

'Cats still lead 30-26 with 3:30 left in the half. Jordan Clayton gets his first collegiate points on a three-pointer. Teams are trading long balls, and Collins calls a timeout to regroup.

27-26 NU with five minutes left in the half. Nicholson picks up his second foul of the day, and we have reached the under-eight.

Wildcats lead 22-18. OH MY GOD BOO BUIE!

He splits to defenders and makes an acrobatic layup through contact for an and-one.

NU's top two scorers are coming alive. Barnhizer takes a massive hit, but somehow his mid-range shot falls and he converts the three-point play.

'Cats have their first lead of the night. Barnhizer pokes it away, and Martinelli finishes through contact at the rim, but can't convert the free throw.

'Cats down 16-14. Barnhizer finally gets on the board with a three-ball to cut WMU's lead to two.

Halfway through the first half, and Boo Buie still has not scored. Not too shabby for a Tuesday night WMU works the ball around for an easy dunk down the lane, but Martinelli responds with a lay-in for NU.

12-9 Broncos with 12 minutes left in the half.

Chris Collins is not happy with his team. Buie's three-ball rattles out, and Barnhizer misses his first shot from deep too.

'Cats are 1-6 from three. Jordan Clayton checks into the game and finds Nicholson underneath for the two-hand jam.

The freshman is getting some early minutes for the Wildcats. Langborg cannot connect on his first two attempts from beyond the arc, but the 'Cats defense has held WMU scoreless in the last three minutes.

NU trails 6-5 at the first media timeout. No shot clock violation.

WMU retains possession. Appeared to be a shot clock violation, but referees say Broncos got the shot off and hit the rim before time expired.

Play is under review. 'Cats turn it over on the first possession, and WMU cashes in from deep on the other side on back-to-back possessions.

On its third possession, Berry hits a triple of his own

6-3 Broncos. Nicholson wins the tip and we are underway. ‘Cats are debuting their new gray jerseys tonight  Tonight's starters for Northwestern:

G: Boo Buie
G: Ryan Langborg
G: Ty Berry
G: Brooks Barnhizer
C: Matt Nicholson

Small ball at its finest. ‘Cats look to remain undefeated to start the season, hosting Western Michigan in non-conference action in 15 minutes. 

Follow along for updates. For the third straight year, Northwestern will send a cross country runner to the NCAA Championships. Ava Earl led the way in Northwestern’s third-place finish at the Midwest Regional last Friday. The Wildcats still have two games left, but are very likely to qualify for a bowl game.  explores where Northwestern’s most likely itineraries may be. All that’s standing between Northwestern and a bowl game is Purdue. As the ‘Cats prep for possibly the last game at Ryan Field, hear what interim head coach David Braun had to tell the media. That ends today's Braun media availability. Braun on NU fans coming out: ""Do everything you can to Ryan Field. This group of young men is an awfully special group. If you haven't had a chance to see them play live yet this season, I promise you: you're going to be proud of the way we play."" Braun on being a favorite against Purdue: ""We're going to stick to the same thing that we've stuck to. Not once have we used external views on this team as motivation. Bulletin board material? Nope, we're good. We've just talked about continuing to battle our tails off."" More: ""There were mistakes made. Through those mistakes, there's growth."" Braun on the rotation for DL going into the season: ""It was absolutely part of the plan. Were we as comfortable with the plan in Week One, Week Two of fall camp? Absolutely not. An intentional effort of our staff, which wasn't easy.""

Mentioned double reps during the fall. Braun on using a timeout to substitute in Madison: ""If an offense substitutes relatively late, they are going to take as much time as they possibly can to essentially enforce a delay of game.""

Said that if an offense subs <20 seconds, ""they are at risk of having that issue."" Braun: ""Any time you start to see drill carry over into games, it's really exciting as a teacher and a coach."" Braun on improving the turnover margin: ""Credit to the offense. Have taken it really seriously. Our staff's done a great job with the ball security circuit. It's been something that's been emphasized. I know for a fact it was being emphasized prior to my arrival."" Braun on snap counts: ""There's definitely a plan that all those guys are going to play, and there's going to be a rotation. They're not on a snap count by any means. Christian [Smith] does a great job of laying that out.""

Mentioned ""keeping guys fresh."" Braun on his conversation about New Ryan Field: ""I'm just worried about winning football games, but what an incredible opportunity for this football team, for this University moving forward. "" Braun on Ray Niro III: ""He's such an asset. On special teams, on offense. Provides you depth. Someone else that the defense has to be concerned with.""

Said that the team loves to get the ball in his hands. Braun on the defensive line: ""I would take that group against any O-line in the country."" Braun on the defensive line rotation: ""Lot of hard work. Lot of humility. It takes a bunch of guys that are there to serve the best interest of the team, not their own personal statline.""

Gave praise to Christian Smith and to veteran players. On using the mutual tape against Minnesota: ""I think where the strongest carry-over for us is on defense.""

Mentioned the two-high shell for both NU and UMN.

""You've got to take a strong look at that."" Braun on playing Purdue's defense: ""Honestly, I think they've done a great job offensively of identifying, 'This is how the defense that we're approaching is structured. Within our structure offensively, how can we attack that?' It's really easy to get a quick snapshot."" Braun on better tackling: ""It's really easy as a coach to step in on a Tuesday practice and say, 'Here's what we're going to emphasize.' I think it is a reflection of our guys making a conscious, intentional effort.""

Also stressed the staff for preaching daily improvement. Braun on D.J. Vokolek: ""There wasn't necessarily a specific position for him to be coaching. He's helped at all three levels of the defense.""

Noted side conversations as being beneficial. Braun on Skip Holtz: ""Skip has embodied humility. A guy that walks into this facility with countless years of head coaching experience. All he's asked along the way is, 'Dave, how can I help?'""

Said he's played a ""critical role"" in recruiting and has ""led the charge."" Braun on offensive continuity: ""We have yet to string two wins together back-to-back. It's time to go back and get back to work. I'm sure our practice habits will show that this week."" More: ""It's not just our captains. It's our leadership that permeates throughout the entire program.""

Said it ""starts through our captains"" and ""trickles down."" Braun on the importance of seniors: ""Words won't do it justice. You've got to be here to truly understand it. These guys haven't flinched. They've served in their leadership role. It has nothing to do with them as individuals. It has everything to do with the program."" Said he was still ""proud"" of how the offense ""stayed the course."" Braun on the second half offense against UW: ""Going into the second half, it's something that I know our offensive staff is evaluating. What do we need to do to start fast in the second half, and close out games? You've got to credit your opponent."" Braun said that Gragg has asked the team ""often"" what it needs from administration. Braun said that Gragg has been ""incredibly supportive"" of the Northwestern team.

""That's a credit to him.""

Added that players have played a role in the coaching search. Braun on if he's talked to Derrick Gragg: ""There hasn't. What I will say, and I'm very confident in, the people that are involved in that process, it's a critical process. They're taking the proper steps to take to ensure that the program is led in the right manner..."" Braun on Ryan Field: ""That evening against Minnesota. That's a memory that will stick with you the rest of your life if you were there. That has been something this team has drawn from.

""It's only fitting and ensure that we play at our best and send it off the right way."" Braun on Senior Day: ""That's what it's all about. I think one of the biggest challenges that we'll face as a team on Saturday is using that emotion to channel that into focus, and being at our best. The emotion is an indication of how much these guys care."" Braun said that Coco Azema is ""day-to-day,"" and that the team is ""hopeful"" that he'll play against Purdue.

Said ""absolutely"" regarding if he expects Azema to play again this year. Braun on Tracey Fuchs: ""Tracey's incredible. She's been an incredible supporter of our team, of myself. I was just so impressed with their poise against a team that they had lost to.""

Said the resilience ""embodies"" what NUFB wants to be. Braun on the perception of NU: "" I don't know what the perception is but I know what I see every day out of this group. Hard times real true characters. A lot of people have been affected, and this group has just went to work."" More: ""Man, this group wants to ensure that we battle to have an extra opportunity to extend this season."" Braun on addressing bowl eligibility: ""It's something we addressed even prior to entering Wisconsin. We've talked about leaving no doubt. The opportunity for a bowl game is in our hands. All Wisconsin was was a performance that put us one step closer to an opportunity..."" Braun on the #removethetag posts: ""Love our team. This is a group that continues to pull together. I take that as a sign of, I must be doing something right."" Braun: ""Purdue is hot right now. Offensively, operating at a really high level. Defensively, really well-coached."" Braun says that Northwestern has ""taken seriously"" the intentionality of improving every day. Braun noted the importance of keeping NU's defense off the field against a ""tempo operation,"" and the ""ability to close in the second half as a team."" Braun: ""Going to sound a little bit like a broken record. It was great to have the guys back in the facility.""

Said they met this morning.

""Really proud of the way that we went into a hostile environment and attacked. The way that our offense performed...was critical."" Braun's opening statement: ""Would like to start off by congratulating Tracey Fuchs and women's field hockey. Off to the Final Four. Was fortunate enough to stop down for the second half for my wife and boys yesterday. It was awesome to see the way the team continued to battle."" David Braun set to speak to the media shortly from the Walter Athletics Center. Michigan and Ohio State remain on a collision course as the rest of the teams jockey for bowl eligibility. 

Around the Big Ten, Week Eleven Northwestern women’s basketball’s victory over Omaha showed off some real strengths, but also an issue that must be corrected as the schedule gets tougher. Here are three takeaways from Northwestern’s Sunday afternoon win. Northwestern field hockey can get the job done in so many different ways, and that’s why the ‘Cats are headed to the Final Four for the third straight year. It’s hard to make Camp Randall quiet on Saturdays but the Wildcats did just that last weekend. 

Here are five takeaways from Northwestern’s convincing upset win over Wisconsin. McKeown realized late that this win technically makes him the winningest coach in Northwestern history. 

He closed out the presser with, ""Let's have a party!"" McKeown joked that the team really likes to take tough shots.

""We might have a couple practices where there's no ball in the gym."" McKeown on Crystal Wang: ""You're going to see a lot of her. The big stage doesn't faze her. Just got to fit her game into what we're doing."" McKeown said that Mercy Ademusayo has been fighting illnesses and injuries, but noted it was great to have her on the floor against Omaha. McKeown on Jasmine McWilliams: ""She's a grind-it-out, gutty player. We need that. She'll dive on the floor, we've seen it in practice too. She gives us that spark, and hopefully it'll be contagious, because we need more people to do the same."" McKeown on the early start: ""Seeing the ball go in the basket got their confidence up. We got some steals and turnovers, and defended. 

""You've got to sustain it though, and that's what we talked about after the game."" McKeown on the ball movement: ""The biggest thing is, are we getting the ball to the right people at the right time? And that's the key. I thought we made some great passes in transition. Our threes were all off pretty good passes, it's encouraging."" McKeown noted that he saw Daley's potential in the team's road win against Iowa in 2021-22, and the team saw her growth in Spain this summer.

""'She now has the ability to bounce back from a missed shot. And she can create her own shot. I'm really proud of her."" McKeown: ""Disappointed with our defense in the second half. We got a little sloppy, and we've got to clean that up."" McKeown: ""We did some great things today, and we did some sloppy things today. It's not even Thanksgiving yet, so most college teams right now are trying to find themselves to see what works, and we're in the same boat."" Joe McKeown now at the podium. Walsh on fouling out twice: ""I think that I need to take more accountability to play smarter defense."" Mott on adjustments starting fast compared to UIC: ""We did a lot of layup drills, a lot of running in practice.""

Walsh noted that the team wanted to bounce back from UIC and develop an early lead to ""dig in."" Mott on how her confidence has grown: ""Throughout my four years here, I've played under Veronica Burton, Sydney Wood and Courtney Shaw. I know what to be, because I've had them."" Walsh and Mott credit the ball movement as the biggest thing they've been impressed with offensively in the first two games. Caileigh Walsh and Paige Mott at the podium. The weather may be getting colder, but the Wildcats’ shooting is staying hot as they move to 2-0. FINAL: NU 87, Omaha 69

Northwestern's 17-0 run to open the game sealed it early, and for a second-straight game, Mel Daley was nearly automatic. She led the way with 21 points on a 10-of-11 mark from the field.

Up next: No. 10 Notre Dame in South Bend. Wang earns her first points in purple and white with a nice cut on a give-and-go. 3:30 to play, and the 'Cats are up 83-65. Walsh fouls out for the second-straight game with five minutes to go. After another Omaha three, the NU lead is now 16. Crystal Wang checks in with six minutes to go. The WBB lead is now 25. Also, volleyball is winning on the road at Iowa.   Where in the world does this weekend fall on the ""best weekends in the history of Northwestern Athletics"" list? WBB: Hailey Weaver is now 3-of-4 from three. It's raining buckets in WRA. FH: That will do it for today's availability. FH:  Fuchs ""In previous Final Fours, teams could take out our one or two top players. This year, we are more balanced and consistent than the last two years."" WBB: END OF THIRD: NU 68, Omaha 48

The Mavericks lit it up offensively in the third (9-of-14 from the field), but so did the 'Cats (10-of-17). Daley's got 19 on 9-of-10 shooting. Life is good. FH: Fuchs ""This has been my most rewarding year at Northwestern. To make the Final Four three years in a row, it has been really rewarding for us."" FH: Fuchs on Louisville: ""We were excited to play this game because they are the only team that beat us."" FH; Fuchs "" I knew if we could get a few corners, Wadas was going to hammer it in."" FH: Wadas on the game-winner: ""It's a lot of calm energy. A lot of great plays put us in that position."" FH: Fuchs ""Converting three out of five corners was the difference maker today."" FH: Fuchs ""It's really hard to go to a Final Four, and to do it three years in a row, just really proud of this team.""

""This has been a rewarding season no matter what happens next."" FH: Tracy Fuchs, Lauren Wadas, and Ilse Tromp now at the podium. WBB: Under five minutes to play in the third with Northwestern's lead now at 60-39. Mott has six points in the quarter, and hasn't missed. Daley and Walsh have four apiece. WBB: Omaha sill hasn't missed from the field (that's six shots now), but neither has Daley (seven). WBB: Timeout Northwestern with 7:50 to go in the third.

Follow along for updates. “It was made clear inside Camp Randall on Saturday afternoon: David Braun has earned the right to be Northwestern’s permanent head football coach. It is time to remove the interim tag,” writes. Good night from Camp Randall Bryant's message to Northwestern fans: ""It's a really big game. Come out and support us. We're going to put on a show. We're really confident right now. These last two games are really huge for us. We have a 1-0 mindset."" On helping him prepare: ""Giving him any tips or knowledge that I have... Whether it's gameday or throughout the week. He does the same thing for me. It's a two-way road."" Bryant on Brendan Sullivan: ""He's a great competitor. Really, really good quarterback. He's one to look out for in the years to come. Really smart. Really athletic. Throws a great ball."" Bryant on better OL play: ""They played a phenomenal game. I'm so happy for those guys. They work their butts off. I don't really feel banged up at all. I feel pretty good.""

Said he won't have to ""waddle to the bathroom"" anymore. Bryant on his experiences: ""I never expected to go through all that I've gone through when I went into college. I'm honestly happy that I've gone through all of it. I feel like I've grown into a man. It's a great story for my career."" Bryant on what changed at halftime: ""I don't know. It's a little frustrating. We want to keep our foot on the gas, and keep scoring."" Bryant: ""I think it was just really good coaching all week. We had a plan for some looks we hadn't seen much all season. It was really cool to see.""

On the touchdowns: ""Those were just the guys making a play. Cam won one-on-one."" Mentioned a pick on Henning's TD. Bryant on possibly being bowl eligible: ""I think it would mean a lot. I've been lucky to experience a bowl game every year of my career, and some of those guys haven't had that experience.""

Mentioned how beneficial it can be for young players to develop during extra practice. Bryant on starting hot: ""It's big. It was big to just go out there and make a statement. Just score consecutively, and not take our foot off the gas."" Bryant said today was a ""great atmosphere.""

In terms of spreading the ball around, he attributed it to confidence.

""I trust all those guys out there. I know they're going to make a play."" Bryant said he felt dialed in after the first drive.

""I think just getting that first drive and those first couple completions really just gives you the confidence to go out there and do it the rest of the game."" Bryant on Braun's growth: ""He's never wavered. He stepped in in a really difficult situation. Taken us to this point. He's the guy that everyone looks to to lead and motivate. We're going to follow him wherever he goes. We love him as our head coach. We love him."" Bryant said he got ""swarmed"" by former Cincinnati strength coaches and players as he left the field.

Noted ""similarities"" in terms of Fickell's defense here at Wisconsin, but also new elements.

""It was cool to see some of that stuff translate."" Bryant on Fickell: ""I didn't talk to him at all this week. I have nothing but respect for that guy. He gave me the chance to come back to Cincinnati. He's a really good coach and leader. He's going to do great things at Wisconsin."" Bryant on any worry about rust: ""I think maybe if I was a redshirt freshman. I'm so experienced. I think all of that plays into helping me."" Bryant on his role the last few weeks: ""I think just seeing it from a different perspective. You kind of pick up on things that you might not see when you're playing. Learn about being more of a leader, honestly. I learned how to lead off the field."" Bryant on when he felt like he was ready to play: ""I think last week, we kind of started a throwing progression. We kind of slowly eased into it. We did a really good job of managing that.""

Last weekend, he knew ""I'm back."" Ben Bryant now at the podium.

On his rehab process: ""It was frustrating not being able to be out there with my teammates. Injuries suck. It was so nice to get back out there."" Gallagher on Bryant: ""We didn't focus on it much. Ben and Sully are great players. We focus on the defense and believe that they will get it done on the offensive side."" Gallagher on his message for next week's home game: ""Come out. Be loud. Support us. We're battling each and every week. We're doing out best to get wins for our fans."" Soares on his growth this season: ""Guys like Bryce and Xander have been pushing me to be better. Just being able to stay the course has been big."" Soares on his first sack celebration: ""I thought about it, but I did not execute it."" Soares on Jump Around: ""Having fun. That's the most important part of the game, is really just embrace the moments."" Gallagher on playing with a lead as a defense: ""I mean, it's huge. You have that insurance knowing that the offense is playing really well."" Soares on his deflection: ""Thought process is just get a stop. Don't let them score. We always preach, 'Threes don't beat us.'"" Gallagher said that having ""11 guys on the same page"" was critical as to why the defense succeeded. Soares said that the team is ""focusing on coming together as a team,"" and attributed that as to why the result was different this year against the Badgers. Gallagher also noted that the team wants Braun to ""be here for a long time,"" and that the ""team wants to battle with him each week."" Gallagher on learning under Braun: ""He's come in and done a great job installing his system as a DC. Something that we love to go out and execute the plan he's putting the place in for us.""

Said he's done an ""absolutely phenomenal job"" as head coach. Soares said that it's his dad's birthday, and wanted to get him a sack as a present. Gallagher on Wisconsin's rushing attack: ""I think that's a credit to their D-line. It really came down to guys doing their job.""

Mentioned fitting runs and staying in gaps. Gallagher on winning against Wisconsin: ""It was huge. Something we preached all week was going on the road and getting a win."" Bryce Gallagher and Kenny Soares II will head to the podium. That ends Braun's media availability. Braun on locker room celebrations: ""The dance moves already got busted out. I'll leave it to other guys to judge my rhythm and expertises. There's nothing more exciting than celebrating a win."" Braun on Jump Around: ""They were just having fun. A bunch of college guys that love playing the game of football. Love playing together.""

Called it ""one of those iconic things in college football,"" and said it was played during practice. Braun on third down success: ""It was great to see them staying ahead of the chains. It was efficient. The ball was coming out on time. Efficiency has the ability to lead to explosiveness."" ""He continues to set the standard."" Braun on Bryant playing against Fickell: ""I don't know if preparation changes. Ben's a competitor. That dude was laser-focused all week. He was laser-focused to get back as soon as he could."" More: ""I'm talking football sometimes. A lot of times, we're just talking life. It's tangible."" Braun: ""What I've learned over the years is that, at the end of the day, we coach people. We coach student-athletes. We don't coach football players.""

Said ""meeting people where they're at"" is the ""ultimate blessing,"" something he relishes as a head coach. Braun: ""This team is full of purpose-driven dudes."" Braun on if this road win meant more: ""Honestly, no.""

Said that the team ""put four quarters together.""

""What means the most to me is that I got the opportunity to do it with those guys."" Braun said he doesn't have an update on Coco Azema's status.

""We're hoping he's back on the field sooner than later."" Braun on Porter: ""I think our o-line did a good job moving the line of scrimmage. I was really proud of the way all those guys ran."" Braun on Jaheem Joseph: ""So stinking proud of him. Jaheem's not someone that may have been satisfied with his number of snaps. He continued to own his role, continued to prepare."" Braun on defensive improvement: ""Again, it's guys that have continued to improve fundamentally. That haven't gotten so caught up in scheme.""

Mentioned tackling and ball-out breaks.

""I've got to point out the leadership on that defense."" Braun on reducing penalties: ""It's critical. It makes sure that you keep yourself ahead of the chains offensively."" Braun on containing Wisconsin's run defense: ""That O-line of Wisconsin is really good. Coach Smith, Coach McGarigle of the front-seven did a really good job of the preparation this week.""

Stressed finishing plays.

""They weren't going to allow themselves to be blocked."" Braun on the offensive line: ""Just a group that's continued to tune everything out. Go back to work.""

Emphasized a first-quarter pass play that created a clean pocket. Also praised the pass pro work of the running backs, such as Tre Tyus.

""It takes everyone to protect the QB."" Braun on bowl eligibility: ""We're in a great spot. We talked as a team on Tuesday about leaving no doubt. At the end of the day, we took in the right direction in terms of leaving no doubt.""

Said that that manifests by the ""way that you prepare."" Braun on winning in Madison: ""We talked about complementary football. The best thing to do against a tempo offense like Wisconsin is play with a lead.""

Says this group's confidence is ""real"" Braun mentioned Bryant's third-down completion to Johnson in the end zone as emphasizing him being locked in. Braun said that the team was going to ""take it one day at a time"" regarding Bryant's injury. Noted his improved confidence as the week went along. On if he's earned the full-time job: ""That's not up to me."" Braun on winning five games in his first year: ""It means that I'm so stinking proud of this group of guys. So proud of this staff. So proud of the way that everyone has continued to battle."" Braun on being 5-5: ""It's a bunch of purpose-driven people...that know why they're doing what they're doing.""

Said the team's ""purpose is greater than self."" Braun said that last year's game against Wisconsin was ""never"" brought up.

""We knew we just had to be rooted in our purpose.""",656,2023-11-12 00:00:46,2023-11-18 21:41:56
47,"Porter is stuffed on third. Olsen coming on. On the Illinois 31, Porter gets one more. Illinois burns its last TO with 2:11 left.

Key third-and-8 now. Porter gets one, and Illinois calls its second timeout. On fourth, Paddock is dropped by Anto Saka! Northwestern takes over at the Illinois 40 with 2:20 to go! On a fourth-and-3 from the 40, Illinois calls TO. Olsen is barely good from 45, but it still counts.

45-37 Northwestern with 2:56 to go. Porter hits the left side but is cut down, and Northwestern will send on Olsen. From the Illinois 25, Bryant is sacked by Newton. Ball is now backed up to the 32. Third-and-16 for NU. Porter is stopped by Jacas after getting just one. On third down, Devin Turner knocks it away, and Mueller has an interception!! The Wildcats are at the Illinois 26! Johnson has tight coverage on Washington to force an incompletion. Now third-and-6 for Illinois with 5:07 to go. Love makes one jump cut but is met after getting only four. Love works the left side and is spun down after collecting a first down. Bryant throws a deep fade to Kirtz, but he's intercepted for a second time. Terrific body positioning by Strain.

The Illini are down at their 6. Porter hits a BIG hole and is all the way down to the Illinois 46. Gain of 22 yards. Bryant zips one to Mangieri, who astutely noticed the blitzing slot corner and vacancy. Pickup of seven. Henning calls for a rare fair catch. Rieman drops the two-point conversion. That kind of insanely weird game.

Still 42-37 Northwestern with 7:17 left. On fourth-and-goal, Paddock locates Washington, left alone in the back corner of the end zone. It's now 42-37 Northwestern, and Illinois will go for two. Illinois' offense is staying on the field, down 42-31 with 7:18 left. Paddock MISSES a wide open Williams on a playfake. Unbelievable. Terrific knockaway by Johnson to make up for the foul. It's now third-and-goal from the 1. Turner helps wrap up Love, who's short at the 1. Theran Johnson called for PI against Washington in the corner of the end zone, and the Illini will have it at the 2. Paddock is tripped up on the handoff, but keeps the ball. Loss of four. Jaheem Joseph walking off with trainers after that huge catch and run. Paddock rolls left and finds Washington with a ton of space. The receiver runs all the way down to the Northwestern 5 after cutting it back. Paddock hits Reiman underneath for five on first. Olsen's kick is fair caught at the 25, and Illinois finally held on to the ball on special teams. Northwestern leads 42-31, and has scored 14 points in under 10 seconds.

This HAT might as well be crooked. Northwestern forces a fumble on the kick return, and Garner Wallace has a touchdown!!

WHAT IN TARNATION IS GOING ON Ben Bryant Bryant keeps and runs up the middle for a Northwestern touchdown!

It's 35-31 Wildcats. We have a shootout. Call stands after review. It is indeed a crucial first down. Bielema calls timeout. For now, it's first-and-goal from the Illinois 8. Bryant throws outside to Kirtz, who makes the catch and has just enough for a first down. However, this one may be coming back. Bryant is *nearly* intercepted on second down. It's now third-and-7 from the Illinois 15. Gordon makes an acrobatic catch off a deflection for three yards. NU at the 15. Williams muffs the fair catch, and Northwestern has it! The Wildcats are at the Illinois 18! No idea what that was, but it was clearly busted. Henning wound up with the ball on what seemed to be a trick play, but lost yardage. Renner will now punt. Himon swivels his way to a third-and-1. Key play here for the Wildcats. Bryant finds Thomas Gordon for five on first. Henning's kick return is halted at the 23.

End of the third quarter: Northwestern 28, Illinois 23

This game has been back-and-forth all afternoon/evening, and that isn't changing anytime soon. The Illini are at Northwestern's 42 as the fourth begins.

Hold on to your hats, literally. Love bounces a run outside but is met by Soares and Joseph. Two-yard gain. Paddock works good timing with Washington on a stop route, and the Illini are quickly at Northwestern's 44 in two plays. On first down, Love jukes out Gallagher en route to a 13-yard gain. Illini at their 40. Olsen's kick is short from 45. Couldn't tell if it was deflected up the middle or not, but NU comes up empty. Could prove consequential.

Still 28-23 'Cats with 1:05 to go in the third. Working out of the pistol, Nicario Harper shoots down the line to bring Porter down in front of the sticks. Jack Olsen is coming on to try from 44. With Newton in his face, Bryant flips it to Porter, who gets seven. It's third-and-3 from the Illinois 27. Bryant checks it down to Tyus, who loses the football again. The ball is ruled incomplete, though. The 'Cats have attacked outside the numbers well all day, and dial it up once more to Kirtz. It's another first down at the Illini 34. NU spells Porter for Tyus, who hits the middle for three yards. Porter keeps his legs moving on third down and has sufficient yardage for a new set of downs. Porter makes one Illini miss but is two yards shy of the marker. Bryant keeps it again but scoots for only three. Northwestern at its 44.

He acknowledged “angst about the state of our athletic department” and said he has “focused internally,” working with staff, student-athletes and supporters to commit to a “culture steeped in integrity and excellence.” What happens in Vegas (losing by 38), stays in Vegas. Final: No. 13 Florida State 90, Northwestern 52

Hailey Weaver (12 points, 13 rebounds) had a career day, but the Wildcats never led. FSU had four players with 11 or more.

The Wildcats suffer their second significant loss to a ranked team, and fall to 3-2. Florida State has its largest lead of the game, up 26 with 6:24 left. End of the third quarter: Florida State 63, Northwestern 40

Hailey Weaver has a double-double with 10 points and 11 rebounds, scoring eight points in the third. But every time NU tries to mount something, FSU has an answer. The Seminoles have gone cold, making just one of their last seven shots, but it's still an 18-point game at 4:18 mark of the third.

Hailey Weaver most recently cashed in with a three off an FSU turnover. Florida State augments the lead to 22, entering a 8-0 run to start the third quarter. 'Cats call timeout. Several Wildcats are in the thick of the playoff hunt with their NFL teams, making big plays to secure huge wins. Halftime: No. 13 Florida State 41, Northwestern 27

The Wildcats posted more on the scoreboard in the second frame than the Noles, and have outrebounded FSU, but it's still a 14-point game.

O'Mariah Gordon leads all scorers with 11, while Paige Mott has eight for the 'Cats. A three from Carla Viegas halts some purple momentum and makes it 35-23 Florida State. Jasmine McWilliams adds four quick points off the bench, but the hole is still 32-18. Just like that, FSU has gone on another 7-0 run. Seminoles lead 30-12. End of the first: No. 12 Florida State 23, Northwestern 8

Taking on the Seminoles is tough enough, but the 'Cats have made just 16% of their shots. Caileigh Walsh is 1-for-4, while Melannie Daley is 1-for-3.

Alexis Tucker has eight for the Noles. Northwestern is shooting 2-for-15 from the field after a layup from Paige Mott, and trails 20-6 with a little over two minutes in the first quarter. Caroline Lau hits two free throws, and the 9-0 FSU run is finally over. It's still an eight-point game, though. Seminoles lead 12-2, in part because Northwestern has gone three-and-a-half minutes without a score. Florida State up 6-2 after two threes from Alexis Tucker. Northwestern women's basketball is getting set to take on No. 13 Florida State from the Ball Dawgs Classic in Las Vegas.

Tune in to our friends at  for coverage (including former INU EIC !), as this one is on FloHoops. “I think this year is going to be a way different story.”

After being outscored 88-17 to Illinois the last two years, Northwestern seniors Bryce Kirtz and Garnett Hollis Jr. and ready to win back the HAT — in part, because of finishing in practice. In this Where are we Wednesday,  stresses basking in the moment this Thanksgiving for Northwestern football, and celebrating what the Wildcats have accomplished. This is an Annabel Skubisz appreciation post. It all comes down to the top two Big Ten teams on Saturday. Wishing the best to Coach McKeown and his family. From the HAT to Dakota Marker to even his go-to Thanksgiving plate, hear what David Braun had to say at his weekly presser yesterday. An 18-year-old school record broken, historic relay splits and standout performances mark Northwestern swim and dive’s outing at the Purdue Invitational. At long last, the construction of a new Ryan Field — with associated concerts — can commence. That wraps up Braun's media availability. On defensive scheme: ""The non-negotiables is going to be, making sure the scheme fits our personnel, fits our players.""

""Guys get themselves into trouble when it's, 'Guys, this is my defense.'"" Braun on if NU will hire a full-time DC: ""I will not be calling defensive plays next year.""

Said he will for Illinois and the bowl game, but that it's ""not in the program's best interest"" to do so after that.

""It would be selfish on my part."" ""I've always felt that my success as a DC is a reflection of having the right room of coaches. It's my job to create a collaborative environment.""

Called McGarigle a ""critical piece"" to success and performance. Braun on Tim McGarigle: ""All you've got to do is sit in on one of our defensive staff meetings.""

Praised Matt MacPherson, Christian Smith, LaMarcus Hicks and others, not to mention GAs.

""We have an incredible room. It's a collaborative environment. Great teachers."" Added that certain players will have decisions to make about whether or not they want to return. Braun on leveraging rotations in recruiting: ""I think it reflects, if we're going to talk about being a developmental program, then our actions better align with that. In some ways, it's forced development.""

Talked about ""trust"" and ""willingness,"" plus earning chances. Braun says that ""conversations have tended to trend in the right direction"" regarding prospect invitational games. Mentioned that he hasn't directly talked to Jim Nagy.

""There's no doubt that there's a lot of guys on this team that have put a lot of good things on tape."" Echoed that ""there was a confidence and a belief that this group could do something really special,"" but that it was largely on the inside.

Praised stories that have ""put on display what this group has done."" Braun on doubters: ""Honestly, that was never a motivating factor. For those that looked at me that way, from the outside looking in, I don't blame people for having that reaction.""

Talked about how Skip Holtz and D.J. Vokolek ""entrusted this program."" Braun on his energy levels: ""I promise you my vertical won't get me recruited anymore.""

Asked himself, ""Hey man, are you really being you,"" after the Duke game.

""Just show up as the best version of yourself each and every Saturday."" Braun called Hollis Jr. ""one of the best corners in the country."" Braun on Garnett Hollis Jr.'s tackle: ""Garnett was our Defensive Player of the Week. Some of it had to do with his interception. A big part of it was that effort play. It was an incredible play; even better effort.""

Noted improving consistency and practice habits. Braun praised Braden Turner and Evan Smith for their special teams contributions.

""It's your proving ground that contributes to confidence."" Braun on special teams: ""It's absolutely critical. It's complementary football. It's all three phases.""

Talked about there being a ""mishap"" on the first extra point, but lauded Will Halkyard for ""flushing that."" Braun on his Thanksgiving plate: ""I don't think I've met a food on Thanksgiving that I didn't like. The hard part is how you fit it on one plate.""

Talked about mashed potatoes, stuffing and turkey.

""Don't count out a dessert."" Braun on Carmine Bastone: ""I'm just really proud of Carm. I'm proud of the way this program operates. For him to just continue to improve...and produce.""

Noted that it's ""no surprise"" based on his practice habits and efforts. Braun on the defense: ""We did not play at our best. We have to play better. Sometimes in modern football, people get tied up in yards, but the only thing that matters are in the wins and lost column. If we thought we didn't have to improve this week we'd be kidding ourselves."" Braun on preparing for two quarterbacks: ""In some ways, we're dealing with a similar set of circumstances.""

Noted that Luke Altmyer and John Paddock have ""played at a high level"" despite having somewhat different skillsets.

""That can create some issues in your preparation."" Braun on possibly ending Illinois' season: ""To be honest with you, it's not something that's on my mind, or that I'll be communicating with the team.""

Emphasized ""finishing off the regular season the way we set out to."" Braun said that he wants to make sure the HAT, as with any trophy, has a ""comfortable place"" in the facility. Braun: ""Rivalry games are always more exciting when there's more on the line. There's certainly a lot on the line this weekend."" ""If you want to beat an in-state rival on some of those recruits...you better show that you're winning some of those rivalry games."" Braun on the best version of the Illinois: ""At its best, you have two programs that are winning a lot of football games. That have great stories to tell. Not only to their own teams, but also on the recruiting trail.""

Praised Bret Bielema's recruiting efforts. Noted that being especially true in defensive prep.

""Probably in that Week One, I was trying to do it as I had always done it."" Braun on his level or organization, Week One to now: ""I think I've always felt comfortable from a standpoint of being with our players, stepping into a leadership role. Trying to bring people together. Where I think I've really grown is understanding where I need to delegate..."" Braun talked about the Dakota Marker between NDSU and SDSU.

""It's basically a really, really heavy rock. You better be prepped in the weight room to lift that thing over your head."" ""There's just something about rivalry games, especially when you're playing for a trophy. Those games are things that stay with you as a player and as a coach. You can certainly sense within this group, especially within the upperclassmen."" Braun on learning about the Illinois rivalry: ""The consistent message is, 'Coach, we want the HAT back.' Just to see and feel and sense the urgency that's with this group right now to ensure we're at our best. One of the many things that makes college football so special."" Braun noted that the team doesn't care about where its recruiting class ranks, prioritizing work ethic and fit. Braun on the '24 recruiting class: ""It's unique with roster management right now. Everyone in the room knows, with still having guys on the roster having a COVID year. We probably have room for two more commitments in the class.""

Emphasized ""staying flexible."" Stressed that ""messaging"" remains largely the same. Braun on talking to recruits as the permanent head coach: ""It changes from a standpoint of, you get less questions. There's a certain level of certainty in terms of the fact that, you make a decision to come to Northwestern. 'Hey, I'm going to be here for that.'"" Noted that ""conversations...will start after Illinois."" Braun said he's stressing ""positions that are currently open"" regarding his coaching staff.

""Those are things that we're taking a look at right now, to make sure that we can continue to push the program forward.""

Said there's ""too much at stake"" to determine other things now. Braun: ""We're rolling. We're excited. Know that we've got  quite a challenge on our hands with a really good Illinois team fighting for bowl eligibility."" Braun noted that Northwestern ""has fallen short in"" the last few games against Illinois.

""We know that there's a lot of things that we have to clean up. Didn't play our best football on Saturday."" Braun's opening statement: ""Really excited about the opportunities ahead of this team. Obviously, Saturday was an incredible opportunity for our guys to send the old Ryan Field off the right way.""

Mentioned that it's ""clear"" that ""we have a lot of work to do."" David Braun set to speak to the media, so make sure you get your cards ready. “Just as Skubisz’s penalty stroke save gave the 2023 Wildcats hope to win, the program’s overall success should give it hope that it’ll be raising the trophy soon again.” writes . Northwestern’s road trip to the Hall of Fame Tip-Off Tournament saw the ‘Cats increase their win total while also adding a tally in the loss column for the first time this season. 

Here are three takeaways from a mixed-bag weekend for Northwestern. With only one week left in the regular season, take a look around the Big Ten to see where each program lies.

Around the Big Ten, Week Twelve: Northwestern is bowl-bound thanks to Saturday’s victory over Purdue. Here are five takeaways from a celebratory afternoon in Evanston. Lyon on the trip to Vegas: ""I'm excited for really good competition. I think being tested early is a really positive thing."" Lyon on the bench: ""Even though the bench only scored 10 points, I feel like they do so much more. I feel like we have strong rotations and a deep bench. Lyons on Daley: ""She's really efficient from two, so why would she take threes? She moves really well without the ball. We anticipate the offense flowing and having different tools. We're going to rely on a lot of different people."" Lyons on playing Florida State: ""We're super motivated. We're going to play Big Ten teams, so playing an ACC team is super exciting."" Lyons: ""We were all disappointed after Notre Dame. I think they were really focused in practice."" Maggie Lyons, sitting in for McKeown, now at the podium. Walsh on foul trouble: ""We just need to play smart."" Daley on Lau: ""I'm Caroline's biggest supporter. She gets us the ball where we need it."" Walsh: ""I'm glad we out-rebounded this team, but I think we should be out-rebounding everyone."" Daley on the second-half comeback: ""We've made it a point this year to play better in the third quarter, but we need to stop digging ourselves in a hole."" Walsh on her performance: ""I didn't play a good game at Notre Dame, and I took that personally. I felt like things were working tonight, but I know that will not always happen, so I need to learn to play through adversity."" Caileigh Walsh and Melannie Daley now at the podium All that matters is the record. FINAL: Northwestern holds of SEMO for a 76-68 victory. 

Walsh and Daley combined for 44 points. Weaver hits a big three, and NU expands its lead to 7. 

Timeout SEMO with 2:35 left to play SEMO had a chance to tie it up but couldn’t finish the reverse layup. 

NU holding on for dear life up 68-64 RedHawks cut it to five, and Joe McKeown will take a timeout with 6 minutes to play. SEMO hanging around, but Daley is cash from the mid range again. 

‘Cats lead 66-56 WBB: ‘Cats clinging to a 59-52 lead entering the final quarter. WBB: Daley has caught fire, and NU now leads 57-48 with two minutes left in the third quarter. Couldn’t have asked for a better season. “It hurts today, but it’ll feed good in a week,” Fuchs said about moving forward. “We never give up. That's why were the Cardiac ‘Cats. We've come back a few times. I thought both teams played their hearts out and that's all you can ask for when you get to this stage.” “Both teams had three or four chances each and overtime to win that match and both goalies came up big on both sides,” said Tracey Fuchs. “So congrats to them, you know, again I couldn't have asked for a better team and a better season.” WBB: Daley has hit from the midrange and NU has tied the game at 40. Northwestern narrowly loses the national title in heartbreaking fashion. After an incredible game and outstanding performance by Skubisz, the 'Cats are unable to finish it out. Heck redeems herself and wins it for North Carolina in shootouts. Peyton misses. Now final death shootouts. Regan Cornelius's shot is stopped. UNC isn't able to score. OBC misses. 2-2. UNC scores. Lindsey Frank stumbles and isn't able to get a shot off. North Carolina misses its third. Lauren Wadas's shot is good. UNC's second shot misses. Goal for Peyton Halsey. UNC's first stroke is good. WBB: Northwestern trails SEMO 40-34 at halftime. 

Yes, you read that right. Shootouts. DEEEEEPPPPPPP BREATHS. Lauren Wadas and OBC have been so close to hitting the boards. When they said defense wins championships, they weren't lying. Katie Jones has stepped up big for the 'Cats on defense in overtime. Another North Carolina penalty corner. Peyton Halsey is green-carded. Player down for two minutes with about six minutes left. Double overtime we go. Deep breaths. SKUBISZ KNOCKS AWAY THE STROKE! I am going to have a heart attack. A Ryleigh Heck break away gives North Carolina a penalty stroke. WBB: Northwestern leads Southeast Missouri 25-18 after the first quarter. 

Caileigh Walsh already has 13 points! Shot just nearly sails right. UNC corner nearly three minutes into OT. And the sudden death begins. OT is 10 minutes. And, we are headed into OT. Shot outside the circle is not a goal. Still even. 30.4 seconds and Northwestern has a penalty corner. 1:21 left and UNC draws a penalty corner. Northwestern picked up its first loss out east against Mississippi State, due in large part to Josh Hubbard and a second-half run. Both teams are struggling to find solid passing, as defenders swarm players. MBB: FINAL: Mississippi State 66, NU 57

Northwestern faded late to pick up its first loss of the year, and shot just 37.7% from the field. Josh Hubbard put up 29 points, and lit up the 'Cats on the perimeter throughout the second half. In summary, this game is a lot of back-and-forth. MBB: Two minutes left, and the Bulldogs have totally taken control of this one. They lead by 13, and Hubbard has absolutely erupted. The freshman is now at 29 points on the day. All even headed into the final 15 minutes of regulations. Deep breaths folks. MBB: And just like that, the Bulldogs have a double-digit lead with under four minutes to play. After an incredibly long video referral, Northwestern is granted another penalty corner. 47.9 remaining 53.6 seconds left in the third and Northwestern gets a corner. MBB: Another bucket from Mississippi State forces an NU timeout. 9-0 run, and now the 'Cats trail 56-48 with  about five minutes to go.

It finished well down the stretch against Rhode Island, but this is certainly going to be a much tougher task. And just like that, the Bulldogs lead with six after another Hubbard three. Mississippi State has picked up momentum quickly, and now has its largest lead of the day. Constant defensive breakdowns for NU down the stretch. MBB: A big three from Barnhizer, but Mississippi State responds with two buckets. Its lead is at three with six minutes left -- back-and-forth heavyweight battle right now. A penalty corner leads to a stoke and who other than two-year captain Peyton Halsey evens it up! ALL EVEN MBB: Barnhizer gets on the board for the second time after a goaltend. Northwestern trails 46-45 at the under-eight. MBB: Buie and Preston can't connect on a pass, and the Bulldogs capitalize with a Shakeel More slam. 44-43 Mississippi State now. MBB: Mississippi State's press confuses Northwestern, and they force a 10-second violation. Bulldogs with a shot to take the lead again with 10 minutes left. The Tar Heels take a 1-0 lead on a penalty corner out of the break. MBB: We've reached the under-12, with NU holding a 43-41 lead.

Berry and Langborg, with 13 and 11, respectively, have been the lifeblood of the offense these last few minutes. MBB: Mississippi State takes its first lead, but Langborg immediately responds with a two. MBB: NU bigs try to stay out of foul trouble challenge: IMPOSSIBLE We’ve got a rainbow at the half. MBB: After a few misses, Berry and Davis trade threes. Big one for No. 3, who has 10 points. No score at the half. The Tar Heels are applying the pressure, but the 'Cats are staying solid. MBB: Hubbard hits another one. One-point ballgame now: NU up 35-34. Northwestern of course gets its second, and the game's second, penalty corner with .7 seconds. MBB: A beautiful Buie floater over two defenders, as well as a swish from Langborg, have the 'Cats up by four. MBB: Second half is underway. North Carolina is dominating possession, leading Nothwestern in shots 5-1, but the defense is holding strong. Magic. Quite a sequence as Annabel Skubisz records a save and Ilse Tromp hits the rebound away in the air. No score after the first quarter. This is going to be a marathon, not a sprint. MBB: HALF: Northwestern 29, Mississippi St. 27

Once again, NU gets out to a fast start, but can't hold it (granted against a much better opponent). The Bulldogs have turned it over 11 times, but Josh Hubbard is killing the 'Cats. He already has 16 points and three treys. MBB: Shawn Jones beats Martinelli to the hoop, and draws an and-one. But a tip-in from Hunger keeps NU's lead at five. Over halfway through the first quarter and it seems these two teams have met their match. MBB: For the second straight day, Buie commits a foul closing out on a three :(

Hubbard makes all three, and it's 25-19 NU with about three minutes to go in the half. In typical 'Cats fashion it takes less than a minute to get a corner. MBB: Ten (10) turnovers for the Bulldogs already. National championship is underway in Chapel Hill. MBB: Luke Hunger with a bucket! His first points since suffering the injury last year! 21-16 'Cats. MBB: 19-13 at the under-eight now, with the Bulldogs looking to cut the lead to four after a Langborg foul on the floor. Looking like a (somewhat) similar trajectory to the URI game. A couple makes from Mississippi State, and the lead is now cut to eight with eight minutes to play in the first. 

Matt Nicholson just picked up his second foul, so now he and Blake Preston have two apiece. The Bulldogs nail their second three-pointer, but two free throws from Nick Martinelli keep NU's lead at 17-6 with about 10 minutes to go in the half. Northwestern men’s basketball

Absolutely DOMINATING the turnover battle It's 15-3 NU after a hook from Martinelli, against the No. 18 team in the country per KenPom ratings. 

If someone told you that after Western Michigan, what would you have said? Legitimately thought Matthew Nicholson blocked that shot Langborg rejected because of how forceful that swat was. Wow. Northwestern men's basketball in the first 10 minutes of games in Uncasville, Connecticut Finally, Josh Hubbard gets Mississippi State on the board with a three. All Northwestern right now, though. Now a Buie three. 11-0. MADNESS. MBB: Well, another day, another FAAAAST start. Northwestern races out to an 8-0 lead, and Langborg and Berry have already nailed threes. NU hasn't missed yet. MBB: The action in Uncasville is just about to tip off, with Northwestern and Mississippi State (No. 18 in KenPom) looking to rack up a quality win and start 5-0. Follow along here! Here’s how to follow along with Northwestern men’s basketball’s toughest test yet: The ‘Cats have arrived For the third straight season, Northwestern field hockey looks to be the last team standing. “For all of its flaws, Ryan Field will always possess an innate charm and quaintness... In lots of ways, that’s the exact essence that Northwestern football has carried with it for these 97 years,” writes  after Northwestern’s sixth win. “It’s no small feat to immediately make your mark on a team full of accomplished veterans,” writes . “But that’s what Bent-Cole and Tromp have done their whole lives: inject pure energy and talent into each team they’re part of.”",255,2023-11-19 00:16:12,2023-11-25 23:59:30
48,"“Northwestern is an under-recruited point guard like Buie. It was too small. It wasn’t supposed to win getting outrebounded 52-27. Every success story should be the exception… 

“They remembered the feeling, and wrote this story,” writes . Lucas Oil Stadium has played host to some pretty great college football games. 

Ahead of Michigan-Iowa,  ranked all nine Big Ten Championships from the CFP era. So that really happened. The officials beat Purdue Purdue having the court/field stormed three times against Northwestern in 2023 Purdue blowing another lead at Welsh-Ryan Arena Presser is done. And let the memes begin. Buie: "" is unbelievable, so be able to get that win tonight... it's good that they got to go out and do what they came out for."" Berry on Hunger, Preston, Nicholson: ""The big men, they played great. Edey's so hard to guard, and I can only imagine how hard they had to fight.""

Said that rotating the bigs seemed to help wear Edey down. Berry on NU's ball security: ""We pride ourselves on taking care of the ball. If you can take care of the ball and stay in the single digits, you can give yourselves a chance."" Buie on creating late in the clock: ""I just try to make the right read every time. We have great players around me, so I'm going to pass if two guys are on the ball. That's the way you've got to play basketball. It just creates havoc for the defense."" Berry: ""The crowd was amazing tonight. You're tired, but then you just hear the crowd erupt. It makes you want to play even more, even when you don't have anything left in the tank."" Berry on the message in the huddle after Edey's shot at the end of regulation: ""We knew it wasn't going to be easy. We came together in that huddle and said, we were gonna get it done the hard way regardless."" Berry on stepping up: ""It's awesome, but also relying on my teammates to get me the ball and get big shots like that."" Berry on himself, Buie and Langborg: ""Me and Ryan, we play our part. Just being ready when Boo hits us to knock down shots."" Buie on the offensive success: ""I think we just did a really good job of just moving the ball offensively."" Collins to the student-journalists (yours truly): ""Good luck with finals. Do your own work."" Ty Berry up next. Collins said that hard-hedging was an adjustment after Smith successfully got downhill early on.

""We were trying to do it to start the game, and then we did it more to take him out of his rhythm.""

Said NU did a good job of tagging Edey on ball screen actions late. On his message to the bigs: ""Every foul against Edey has to matter.""

Said to Preston, Hunger and Nicholson that they all had to be ready to play. Collins on Edey: ""I think if you take Boo off the floor, it's a similar impact to taking Edey off the floor for Purdue.""

Compared Edey's impact and dominance to Tim Duncan andTyler Hansbrough, who he coached or played against.

""For him to play 38 minutes is impressive."" ""When I came 11 years ago, I didn't come to go to a tournament one time. I came to build a program where year in and year out we could be competitive."" -Collins Collins on the current status of the program: ""Let's get to a point where games like this, they're great to win them, but have them be a part of who we are."" Collins on the defensive success: ""We just try to swarm, try to have active hands. Try to double Edey every time he touches it.""

Credited Painter for making their rotations difficult, and for helping Purdue create some open threes. Collins on Langborg: ""We just knew he was a fit. We were out in Sacramento together with him.

Said if Audige and Buie were back, they knew they wanted Langborg.

""He's better of the bounce than people give him credit for."" Collins on Luke Hunger: ""I love Luke. For all intents and purposes, he's a freshman. He's been waiting for his opportunity, and these last couple of games, I'm seeing equity with his teammates, with the coaches. To battle with Zach is a testament to his confidence."" Collins said it was ""huge"" to reduce Purdue's lead to eight entering the break. Collins on his message after going down 13: ""Just that it was a long game. We felt like that we were making some errors on the defensive side of the floor. Our ball screen defense wasn't great tonight. I thought our post stuff was pretty good, actually."" Collins on Buie's performance: ""He thrives in these types of games.  I would not trade him for anybody. I'm glad he's on my team.""

Says he didn't call a timeout at the end of regulation cause all he would have done was draw a play up for No.0 Collins on Buie saying this was a battle between the two best post players in the country (himself and Edey): ""Humble!"" Collins: ""We've got to keep growing. It's still Dec. 1. It's sure a heck of a lot better winning it [tonight]."" Collins on the backcourt: ""I thought we did some really good things. Even in the first half, I thought we were getting what we wanted.

""You've got to play in the midrange against this team. They make you do that."" Collins: ""I think that we made a statement as a school.""

Said that, in addition to academics, ""we can have some fun.""

""This atmosphere was as good as anything I've been in."" Collins credited Berry for closing the game out.

""We knew what they were going to do [at the end of reuglation]. [Edey]'s just so big. They said 'Coach, we're trying, we're trying.'"" Collins: ""We battled all night. We needed coaches. We needed our scout team to get us ready.""

Called Buie ""sensational,"" especially his nine assists and zero turnovers.

""To me, as good a performance as he's had, and as any Northwestern player's had in my time here."" Collins: ""Both teams kept responding. Just a big-time, high-level game. To play a league game, to take care of our home court against that team.""

Said he's ""not really sure"" what anyone can do to defend Zach Edey because of his ""size and skill level.""

""We fought."" Chris Collins now at the podium.

""I'm at a little bit of a loss for words because of what a war that game was. I've been very fortunate to be a part of college basketball... That game ranks right up there in terms of the highest-level game that I've ever been a part of."" Chris Collins now at the podium Painter on NU anticipating the hard-hedging: ""Yes. They started the game in a drop a couple times.""

Said Purdue got good looks, and said NU had to ""sell out to Edey.

""If we played the game again I wouldn't change anything offensively, schematically."" Painter on Northwestern only committing three turnovers: ""We're not a high-pressure team, but it's more a credit to them.

Said that NU's low turnover average was something that was on their radar.

""They have experience."" Mentioned Barnhizer, Buie, Langborg, Berry. Painter on NU: ""This is the best game they've played all year. No question."" Painter: ""When you dominate the glass like that... you expect to win.""

He said the refs were ""fabulous"" tonight.""

""But you've got to be able to stop [Northwestern], and we couldn't do that."" Painter credited Langborg. ""He hadn't gotten going... he made six threes in six games, one of them was a banker. But we knew it was a matter of time before he got going."" Painter credited Boo Buie. Called him ""magnificent."" Painter on differences between the post defense: ""They fouled our big man 15 times. And the refs actually called it, which was pretty cool."" Painter on the turnovers: ""We have to do a better job. Just feeding the post. You have to see the defense when you're passing. A couple of those, I don't think the decisions were terrible...

""What it comes down to was our inability to guard. They hit open looks, and we didn't."" Matt Painter at the podium. Hard to have stock-downs after that, but we tried... Loud chants of ""Let's go"" ringing from the locker room to the media room. Presser to come. It should be a legendary one. It’s a party Zach Edey and Matt Painter sure don't want to visit Welsh-Ryan Arena again. Boy, this sure feels good again. FINAL: Northwestern 92, No. 1 Purdue 88

They did it again. They did it again. They did it again.

Truly one of the greatest games in the history of Northwestern Athletics. No notes. Purdue players coming off the court now. HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF (almost). Clock stops at 0.3 as the students briefly storm the floor. may not like that one... Berry makes both. Timeout Collins. It might be happening. Smith makes it. Two-point game. NU inbounds successfully, and Berry can all but ice it right now at the line. Smith makes the first. Let's see what happens now, with Purdue down three. It's two. That changes a lot. Preston fouls on a three-pointer. Smith draws it, and heads to the line for (temporarily, under review) three. It isn't over with 8.6 seconds to play. Buie has a 30-piece. Hits both. BLAKE PRESTON WITH THE STEAL IN THE POST AND BUIE IS HEADING TO THE LINE He makes one of two. With 25.2 seconds left, Purdue will have a chance to tie or win. Northwestern gets across half-court and breaks the press, and Barnhizer gets fouled. He'll have the chance to make this a three-point game. Buie misses, and Preston can't stop Edey from scoring. 87-86. Timeout on the floor, 34.1 seconds left. That's a charge. Northwestern is getting the ball, and has a chance to make it a two-score game. Not sure if that's happened yet. I have no more words for Boo Buie man. The face of Northwestern Athletics. Preston forces a turnover in the post, and NU is slowing this game down now. Berry draws a foul after Smith turns it over. He has a chance to take the lead at the line with 2:09 to go, and does. 85-84 Northwestern. 'Cats bench urging on the crowd. Preston now draws a foul from Edey (his fourth). He hits one. 84-83. Loyer draws a foul on Preston, and nails both from the line. Purdue back up by two. Berry now. What the hell is happening. Big one from Loyer, who answers Buie's triple with one of his own. 82-79 PU. Boo Buie man. AGAIN with the long three. Loyer splits. 79-76 now. Buie picks up a foul on Loyer. That's four on him. Edey gets the scoring started in OT with a slam. Well over 30. Me on the verge of having a heart attack on continuing to try and watchi this game This is madness. Just out of a fairytale. Edey scores. Overtime. Edey catches it, and Purdue calls timeout. They advance the ball, and 2.7 seconds left. Purdue has to go the length of the court. Here we go. We went down on the court and watched that as it unfolded. Holy. CrapZ We’re on the floor. Boo Buie might have just done it again. 76-73 to go. Buie splits a pair at the line. Game tied at 74. 49 seconds left. Five fouls for Jones. The Evanston native has had a hell of a homecoming. Barnhizer with a huge steal, and Jones commits a foul on Buie as he's dribbling. Boo heads to the line for two. It's hard to breathe right now. This has lived up to the hype and then some. Purdue keeps it. 1:03 to go, Boilers lead 74-73. Jones misses a three, and NU might get the ball back with 1:03 left. Possession under review though. Jump ball after Preston can't finish a lob. NU keeps it. Gillis with the offensive board in traffic, and takes the lead. 1:39 left. Berry picks up his fourth on a charge, and Purdue with a chance to take the lead here. Lance Jones, who has struggled mightily, with a tough finish over Preston. 73-72 'Cats, 2:20 left. He misses both. LOUD. Langborg with a huge steal, and gets fouled hard by Jones. Something something Chase Audige steal-and-slam... Langborg draws a foul on Smith, and drains both. 73-70 ballgame and the arena is on its feet. Preston goes to the line after getting fouled by Edey. He makes one of two. 'Cats with the lead again with 3:40. Edey swishes both. Even at 70. And Nicholson picks up his fifth. Frankly, a ticky-tack call from the refs here in what's been a physical game. It should be Preston on Edey the rest of the way. Edey splits a pair at the line after Hunger's foul. Two-point game approaching the four-minute mark. Hunger drains a free throw at the line. 70-67 with four minutes to go, but Hunger picks up his fifth foul on Edey. He'll come out.

Really huge hand for Hunger. The best game of his career couldn't have come at a better time. CHICKEN SANDWICH CHICKEN SANDWICH CHICKEN SANDWICHHHHHHHH David Braun on the mic. If there was ever a time for complementary basketball, it's now. That Luke Hunger three feeling like... Loyer evens it up with a layup. Even at 66. Luke Hunger with an and-one layup, but misses the free throw. Puts the 'Cats up two. Two for him. All even at 64. Barnhizer now picks up his fourth foul defending Edey. Martinelli coming in for him, it appears. RYAN. LANGBORG. TKR splits. Again. Hunger picks up his fourth foul, and TKR goes to the line yet again. The 'Cats just aren't fully taking advantage of the off-Edey minutes (and he's coming back on right now). TKR goes to the line again for the Boilers, and he splits again. You really just have to love this for Ty Berry. After some early struggles, and some heat from the fanbase, he has just been incredible. That three encapsulated it: he's been the beacon of consistency this team has needed. Kaufman-Renn splits. Two-point game. Langborg picks up a foul on Kaufman-Renn. 59-58 Purdue at the under-eight. 

Buckle. Your. Freaking. Seatbelts. Buie draws a foul, and drains two. 21 points for him with over eight minutes left. Loud chants of ""Boiler Up"" again. The gym is as loud as it's been all night. Caleb Furst. Wow. He rose up and slammed it over two defenders. Edey comes out of the game after a charge on Barnhizer. Ryan Langborg looking like Sacramento Langborg out here, but Edey is... Zach Edey. A slam from him gives Purdue the lead back. Nicholson picks up his fourth with about 10 minutes to go trying to knock it away from Edey. Hunger is back in. He splits the pair. 54-53. Barnhizer draws a foul on Furst, and heads to the line with a chance to take the lead back with 10 minutes to play. Northwestern is getting outrebounded 33-17 and has this game tied. Man. Brief stoppage on here, as Caleb Furst appears to have drawn some blood. Langborg drains a three after missing a long two on the last possession. We're back even at 53 with 11:17 to go. Nicholson back in the game now. A HALF-COURT SHOT HAS BEEN HIT AT WELSH-RYAN!! A sign of things to come? Smith gets to the basket on two straight possessions, and the Boilers have the lead back. 53-50 at the under-12. Edey with a dunk after Hunger doubles, but Barnhizer with a slam on the next possession. It is a ballgame. And-one. Northwestern with the lead now. 48-47. Boo. Buie. END TWEET. What did we just watch?? Edey snags an offensive rebound on Hunger, and heads back to the line. He splits a pair. We are four free throws from chicken... Boo Buie to Purdue’s perimeter defense Buie with another floater. He's taken over. One-point game. Foul on Hunger. 46-45, crowd is rocking at the under-16. Call stands, and Buie hits at the line. 46-43. Huh, this is looking like a familiar story... Buie with an and-one goaltend, and the 'Cats can get it to a one-score game. Play (more specifically, the goaltend) under review). Barnhizer with a post fade after a Purdue bucket, but Buie commits a reach-in. Hunger in for Preston. 44-40 Boilers. Edey just baptized Preston (again)... Langborg with bucket as the shot clock expired, and the Purdue lead is back down to four. Berry with another one. This is great to see. The game is within four, and the crowd is LOUD. Nicholson picks up his third foul, and immediately checks out. Berry drains another midrange. At last, NU is within six. Second half underway. HALFTIME: No. 1 Purdue 40, Northwestern 32

NU just hasn't been able to get this game to six after an early shooting slump. The rotations are slightly late, which have led to some open threes. Buie leads the 'Cats with 11 points on 4/7, but Edey has 14 and has 8 FTs already. Northwestern, in the bonus, misses at the line (Preston does). Edey picks up his second, and he comes out. Huge for the 'Cats, who really haven't been able to generate a paint attack. Loud boos from the Purdue fans. Langborg with a middy, followed with an over the back on Edey (his first foul). 'Cats with a chance to get it to six, which they just haven't been able to do. Preston can't finish a dunk after a pass from Langborg. Golden opportunity missed for the 'Cats there. Langborg with a corner three, and the crowd is back in this one. A travel on Edey, and now Wildside is REALLY in this. 38-30 Boilers with 2:30 to play in the half. Edey hits a pair at the line. Seven of nine from the line already, and it's 38-27 Purdue. Joe McKeown honored at half-court during the under-four for his Northwestern women's basketball-record 252nd win against Omaha on November 12. Buie with the floater over Edey to respond. Just like last year, Purdue is in control early, but the 'Cats are hanging in there. Who are you and what have you done with Blake Preston? Ty Berry is absolutely carrying this offense right now along with Buie. Smoooth Euro from him, cutting the Purdue lead to 31-23. Buie with yet another bucket, and an illegal screen called on Mason Gillis.

The chants of DUI ring out. Berry finds Buie in the corner to keep this at 10 points. Berry and Clayton seem to miscommunicate on defense, and it's a 13-point game after a Smith three heading into the under-eight. Chants of ""Let's Go Boilers."" A money three from Berry, but the deficit stays at 10 after a layup from Furst. 26-16. A reach-in from Clayton puts Purdue in the bonus with 8:50 to go. Not good! Ty Berry forces a turnover off the press, and Luke Hunger with some great hustle to get an offensive board, but a trey from Langborg doesn't go. Buie drains two at the line, and Clayton checks in for him. Edey checks out for the first time, and yet the 'Cats just can't rebound. Almost three straight offensive boards for the Boilers there. 5 of 15 from the field. David Braun gets a standing ovation as he lifts the HAT over his head.

""We're so excited for our bowl opportunity. It's time to take the purple to the College Football Playoff,"" Braun said. Nicholson picks up his second foul on Edey, and we head into the under-12 with Purdue up 20-11. Heide with a trey, and the Purdue lead is up to nine now. Awful possession for the 'Cats there. Martinelli holds the ball late in the shot clock, and Purdue scores on a turnover. Buie with a NICE hesitation, and he glides to the rim. Braden Smith buries a triple, giving Purdue a 15-9 lead. Aaaand Edey dunks on Preston's head. Might be seeing a little more of that. Nick Martinelli checks in for Berry. 10-9 Purdue. Same thing happened here for a bit. Barnhizer with a deuce, and then Preston commits a foul on a down screen. Under-16 is here, with the 'Cats down 10-9. Loyer with the midrange J, and then Barnhizer fouls Edey. He makes both, and Blake Preston checks in for Nicholson. 10-7 Boilers. Ryan Langborg from the corner for threeee! And he responds with a post hook. 6-4 Purdue. ""F--- Zach Edey"" chants already from the student section. MATTHEW NICHOLSON OH BABY And-one three after Berry fouls Loyer in the corner off a kick from Braden Smith. He makes the free throw, and it's 4-2. Buie gets out on the fastbreak after a steal, finds Berry, and the 'Cats go up two. LOUD. Lance Jones guarding Buie. Nicholson picks up one as Edey boxes him out. Looks like a differently reffed game than last year already. Edey wins the tip, and we're off. It's hard not to get emotional watching this. A LOUD ""Boooo"" from the crowd when Buie comes out. Absolute chills. Purdue gets greeted with tremendous boos. Here come the ‘Cats. 

It’s is damn loud in here Loud cheering from the students after last year's upset is shown on the board during ""Dream On."" Starters for the Boilermakers: Braden Smith, Fletcher Loyer, Lance Jones, Trey Kaufman-Renn, Zach Edey

For the Wildcats: Buie, Langborg, Berry, Barnhizer, Nicholson T-30 minutes, and  is ROCKING. One hour. Everything you need to know about this Big Ten opener can be found right here: We’re in the building. This one doesn’t need buildup. After eight years with the Wildcats, Shane Davis will no longer lead the volleyball program. BREAKING: Northwestern volleyball has moved on from HC Shane Davis.

The Wildcats went 15-15 and 9-11 in the Big Ten this year. They haven't finished above .500 in conference play since at least 2013.

Davis was a defendant in a hazing lawsuit, dating back to a 2021 suspension. With the 2023 regular season having come to a close,  and  hand out some awards — including MVP, most improved and even favorite Braunism — on the 14th episode of Pound the Talk. On a basketball (!) pod,  and  look at both Northwestern teams’ early seasons and dive into the team on everyone’s minds today: Happy December. Happy gameday.

Tonight, he returns. That wraps us up here from Welsh-Ryan. Buie on the differences between NU this year and last year: “We have new guys. We’re able to space the floor a little more.”

On Purdue, he’s noted that he’s depended on the scouting report. Buie: “ are the best in the country. We’re going to need them tomorrow night.” Buie on how the experience/film last year helps: “I haven’t watched too much of last year’s game, because everything is different. I’m just reading the scouting report, listening to the coaches, and trusting them.” Buie on toughest challenge: “Zach Edey. He’s huge, and they play through him. Obviously it’s going to be a tough task with him.” Buie on playing Purdue again after the upset: “We’re super excited. Obviously they’re the No. 1 team in the country, so that brings a lot of energy.” Boo Buie up next. Berry on how last season’s win affects this game: “We try not to focus on last year. It’s a new year, anyone can beat anybody.” Berry: “Every game we just pride ourselves on doing what we know. Just relying on strategies and doing what we’ve done.” Ty Berry at the podium. Collins on K.J. Windham: “Just a winner. Lots of toughness.

“He’s just all about winning. He fits not just as a player, but with our culture.” Collins on taking steps to stay out of foul trouble: “We just have to be smarter, especially our main guys. We’re just getting too many silly ones.

Noted Buie’s foul off a turnover against NIU as an example.

“We’re going to have to have our main guys on the floor.” Collins on the defense: “Work in progress. But that took time as well (last year).

Noted the Pitt, Ohio State losses as examples of growing pains. Stressed working in new pieces.

“I feel like we are getting better. I think a week of practice for us really helped.” Collins on the pace: “I don’t think an up-and-down game is gonna favor us. That being said, if we force turnovers, we can push and attack.”

Said he’d prefer the game’s scoring to be in the low 60s. Collins on Barnhizer’s role tomorrow: “You need your guys to step up. We need Brooks to be dynamic. He’s a unique guy because he can play all over the court. We’re gonna need his production to give ourselves a chance.” Collins: “you’ve got to pick and choose your poison at times with this team. We’re going to have different schemes to try to get [Edey] off the block, but at the same time you’re going to give up a few shots at times.” Collins noted that Braden Smith and Fletcher Loyer have taken big steps for Purdue. Collins said he’d rather play Purdue later in the season because of the “better picture” from more in-season film. Collins: “It’s really hard to replicate Edey in practice.”

Says playing a team like Purdue, NU needs to play “a picture perfect game” Collins says tomorrow feels like a Big Game despite it being only November. Here at Welsh-Ryan Arena for men’s basketball media availability! Chris Collins up first. Northwestern women’s basketball struggled mightily on the defensive end in Vegas and at home, which has led to a three-game losing streak: Lawson becomes the first Northwestern player to enter the portal.

The grad transfer DL from Fresno State played just one game with the Wildcats before suffering a season-ending leg injury.

Wishing him the best moving forward. Are you missing the Big Ten West already?

Us too, so we ranked all 10 division champion teams ahead of this weekend’s Big Ten Championship: First quarter* That's all from Welsh-Ryan. McKeown on Harter: ""She's someone I feel like can play multiple positions. She's smart, she's tough. We're seeing her confidence level go up. I think you're gonna see a lot of Casey Harter... there's a lot of great stories to come there."" McKeown on Daley's foul trouble: ""We need her on the floor, we need her firepower. She's also a defensive presence. Have to look on tape at the fouls, to see how we can clean them up... because she's too valuable to us and opens us up on the offensive end."" McKeown on Alana Goodchild playing the entire third quarter: ""We're not a great three-point shooting team, and having her out there with three guards allowed us to stretch the floor.""

Said that people will see her as ""a legitimate threat from deep."" McKeown on cleaning up turnovers and transition defense: ""Our turnovers sometimes are coming from trying to push the pace, which is how we want to play at times, but we have to make better decisions.""

Shouted out Casey Harter for doing that. McKeown: ""I was really disappointed today. I thought we had a great week of practice heading into today. We have to look at everything. We're fouling people just because we're out of position."" McKeown on taking steps to start faster: ""We got to look at everything, from shot selection to defense.

""Great players make you foul, but we're fouling people from being out of position."" McKeown shouted out Loyola's coaching staff for being ""ready to play."" McKeown: ""Disappointed. The way we started in the fourth quarter is unacceptable, and something we have to address."" Northwestern presser to start. Joe McKeown at the podium. FINAL: Loyola 73, Northwestern 68

NU's comeback falls just short, and the slow start proved to be too much to overcome. The Wildcats drop their third straight, and have 5-1 Georgetown up next. (yes, they needed a three there) Walsh misses a layup, no foul is called, and that should do it. Do you need a three here? Fisher hits both. 72-68 Ramblers, and it looks like Northwestern will need another miraculous sequence to extend this one. Northwestern fouls, sending Alyssa Fisher back to the line with 12.4 seconds to go. If she misses one, NU will have a chance to at least tie. Just when you thought it was over...

A FOUR-POINT PLAY FOR WEAVER! This could be a 70-68 game in a second. Offensive rebound for Loyola with 25.6 seconds to go, and this one should be just about over if the Ramblers can hit their free throws. Mott picks up an offensive foul with 55.4 seconds to go, and this should become a foul game real soon. A defensive breakdown on Lau leads to an and-one for Alyssa Fisher, and the Loyola guard makes this one a five-point game. She now has 16 points on the day. PAIGE MOTT WITH THE SEAL IN THE POST FOR THE BUCKET! Terrific positioning from her, and it makes this a two-point game with 1:32 left. Timeout Ramblers. Weaver with two free throws to get to 15 points on the day. 66-62 Loyola. Big bucket from the Ramblers with 2:45 to play, making it a 66-60 ballgame. Mott with two big free throws. She's struggled from the field, but is 8-of-9 from the free-throw line. Big points from her. Under five to play now, and a Galanopoulos three in Goodchild's face extends the Loyola lead to seven. After Loyola gets points at the line, Weaver hits a floater on the other end. 61-57 now. After a Weaver steal, Walsh turns it over, which leads to a free throw for the Ramblers. Daley, who has four fouls, checks in for Pina. Lau is out of the game right now. Weaver with the and-one after Loyola hits a midrange off a screen-and-curl. One-point game now. Harter with ANOTHER bucket. She still hasn't missed, and now has 14 points. After a Loyola bucket, Mott hits (and converts) the and-one! It's a 54-50 ballgame with 8:30 to go. END OF THREE: Loyola 52, Northwestern 47

A 13-0 run from the 'Cats put them back in the game, and now Northwestern has a fighting chance. Alana Goodchild played the entire third quarter. 

Harter leads NU with 12 points on 5-of-5 shooting. Two free throws from Loyola end NU's really long run, and it extends the Rambler lead back to three. Daley picks up her fourth foul while defending the post. She'll come out for Pina. Paige Mott REJECTED that layup. In a game where Northwestern's transition D has been shoddy, that was a really good sequence from her. Alana Goodchild is on the board, and it's now a 13-0 run for the 'Cats! The Loyola lead is now down to one. Weaver with a really nice rejection on the other end. She's heating up quickly. Weaver with another three, and the Loyola lead is now down to five! Two straight threes for the 'Cats, as Lau and Weaver bury back-to-back triples! 48-40 Loyola, and a timeout from the Ramblers with 3:45 to go. Every time NU generates a little momentum, it gives up a transition bucket. Harter's fifth field goal in five tries and the ensuing fastbreak was a prime example. It's frustrating. Lau to the rack after a pair of free throws from the Ramblers, but Loyola answers on the other end. 44-32 LUC now. Harter has been automatic from the corner. She's at 10 points on the day, and still hasn't missed. 38-30 Ramblers through two minutes in the third. It's Lau, Harter, Weaver, Goodchild, and Walsh. Second half is underway. Alana Goodchild is in for Paige Mott. A huge rivalry week didn’t shake up too much in the Big Ten rankings: Plenty of Wildcat talent was celebrated by conference coaches and media members. HALF: Loyola 38, Northwestern 25

16-0. That's the point difference off turnovers, and it's the one that has mattered most so far. NU is actually shooting better than Loyola from the field after a nice close to the half, but the 10 turnovers have hurt Northwestern badly. Harter with another contested midrange, which brings her up to seven points on the day. She hasn't missed yet. 36-25 Ramblers with 1:22 left in the half. The offensive pace has woken up for both teams. They're shooting a combined 10 of their last 11. Walsh with another three, but Loyola answers with one of their own. Ramblers still lead by 12. Harter with a corner trey in a defender's face to cut the deficit to 12! Galanopoulos now with 14 after another trey, forcing an NU timeout. 28-13 Ramblers with 6:49 in the half. Maggie Pina swishes a midrange J, but the Ramblers answer on the other end with a layup. 25-13 through three minutes. END OF FIRST: Loyola 21, Northwestern 10

The 'Cats have six turnovers already, and are shooting just 3-of-10 from the field. Not the recipe for success! Sam Galanopoulos has 10 points. Casey Harter breaks the scoreless streak with a post fade. 21-8 Loyola now. It is 21-6 Ramblers. This Loyola team was 6-24 last year. Galanapoulos with a free throw and another three, and the Ramblers are now up 11. Under five minutes to go in the first quarter, and the 'Cats trail 12-6. Loyola hasn't turned it over at all yet, while NU has committed three giveaways. After Weaver hits a jumper, Loyola guard Sam Galanopoulos drains a three. It's 11-4. Now eagerly anticipating a bowl game, this NUFB team has exceeded all expectations: Two quick buckets for the Ramblers, and three straight turnovers for the 'Cats, with Walsh picking up an offensive foul. 6-2 Loyola through three minutes. Really nice post feed from Daley, who leads Walsh for a layup to even things at two. We are underway, and the Ramblers get on the board first with a layup. Starting for the 'Cats: 

Caroline Lau
Hailey Weaver
Melannie Daley
Caileigh Walsh
Paige Mott

Same old, same old. Tip is just seconds away. We are live from Welsh-Ryan for some Wednesday morning (?!) action! Northwestern WBB takes on Loyola Chicago as the 'Cats will look to get back in the win column. Follow along here! The ‘Cats are off to a rocky start...at least nobody can question their strength of schedule Per release, here were Northwestern's All-Big Ten defensive/specialist honorable mentions:

K Jack Olsen (coaches/media)
CB Rod Heard II (coaches/media)
DL Aidan Hubbard (media)
S Coco Azema (media) Braun: ""This award is a reflection, first and foremost, of our players. This award is a reflection of the true character that's in this program, and in this facility.""

Also shouted out staffers' work. Also noted that NU ""has to be the most physical team on the field"" every game. Braun on Northwestern's identity: ""Fundamentals and technique. When people turn on the film, they tangibly see a group that plays really, really hard. Uncommon effort. A group that plays together; that truly trusts one another, loves being around one another."" Braun on recruiting: ""When there's change like this, it's an opportunity to really take a step back and evaluate everything. We've done that.""

Said there are ""areas where we need to push the envelope and evolve"" in a new CFB landscape while sticking to fundamentals. Braun on playing well in all phases: ""That's how the 'Cats are going to have to win games: team football. At the end of the day, we're one team.""

Says there was an ""unwavering belief"" among NU.

""That's what this team has proven it has the ability to do on a consistent basis."" In the second half against NIU, Northwestern was a vastly different team and one that heads into playing No. 1 Purdue on a positive note. Braun, reflecting on when he first took over: ""To say I was out of my comfort zone was the understatement of the century.""

Noted the ability to ""pour into"" and ""put his arm around"" a team that needed it. From never having coached at the FBS level to the Big Ten Coach of the Year, what a special arc it’s been for David Braun. Braun: ""This group just found a way to improve throughout the season. Certainly think that we're playing our best football right now."" Braun, speaking live on BTN, on winning Coach of the Year: ""It's surreal. It's a credit to our players. It's a credit to this staff. It's a credit to the resolve of the entire program.""

Said he knew the team ""had the opportunity to do some special things"" in July. BREAKING: David Braun has been named the 2023 Big Ten Coach of the Year!

Braun, who had never been a head coach at any level, took the Wildcats from 1-11 to 7-5 and a bowl game. He also won five conference games, including three straight to end the year. Northwestern LB Xander Mueller made the media's All-Big Ten Third Team.

His 10.5 TFL and three interceptions led NU. No. 34 also racked up five sacks, 102 tackles and two pass deflections. Jack Olsen did not win Big Ten Kicker of the Year.

His elite celebrations, on top of his 82.4% conversion rate, should have been enough. Northwestern LB Bryce Gallagher made the All-Big Ten Second Team! His 110 tackles ranked third in the conference.

This is his second straight appearance on the award list, following a Third Team media selection last year. In a few minutes on Big Ten Network, the Big Ten will be announcing some of its awards — notably Coach of the Year and All-Big Ten defensive players and specialists. Stay tuned for announcements! Northwestern football offers a lot to be excited about, but don’t forget about the team’s NFL alumni. ""Being ourselves and taking it one day at a time"" Buie said is the mindset headed into Purdue. ""We treat every game the same. Whether it's Big Ten or non-conference,"" said Buie. ""I know we needed some energy,"" Buie said of coming strong out of the half. ""I was going to make it a point to be aggressive. The plan was to score."" ""He's seven-foot for a reason. You want to get him the ball at the highest point. It's really all about making a read,"" Buie said about his lob with Nicholson. ""When guys are getting double figures, it really shows our connectedness and unselfishness,"" Buie said. ""Any of us can have 20 points."" ""I didn't even know it was my hundredth start. But obviously, this place is super special to me and is a huge reason of why I cam back for a fifth year,"" Boo Buie said. ""Not to make the game bigger than it is,"" Collins said is the message headed into Purdue. ""It's a new year. They're new. We're new."" ""If you look at our schedule, I think we've seen better teams than we have in previous years,"" said Collins of NIU, Dayton, Rhode Island. ""I think we've tested ourselves well in those six games."" ""We tried to stay more compact with our ball-screen coverage...I thought our guys did a really good job defensively in the second half."" ""I've never seen someone distort the game in a positive way the way I've seen Zach Edey,"" said Collins, who elaborated that Edey is one of the most dominant players he has seen in his career. ""This is a game that our guys are really excited for. Hopefully, the fans are excited and the students are excited. I'm not sure I've seen a team as well-rounded at this point in the season. They're the best team in the country, no question,"" Collins said of Purdue. ""Everyone knows how important Boo is to us and every team is going to try and take him out of the game... We have to develop the rest of our team,"" said Collins, who pointed out the performance of first-year Jordan Clayton. ""Usually, when Ty is in double figures, it bodes well for us,"" Collins said. ""What I love is that it came in different ways....He was a well-rounded player tonight and his defense was on point."" ""He was able to not only have big scoring numbers but big assist numbers,"" said Collins of Buie's contributions. ""It can't just be the Buie and Barnhizer show offensively,"" Collins said. ""That's why Matt [Nicholson] was huge."" He also acknowledged how impactful Nick Martinelli's 11 points were. Boo Buie didn't feel great about how he played against Mississippi State, said Collins. But was able to make up for it tonight. ""[Buie's] little burst gave us the separation we needed. And Ty [Berry] was fantastic,"" said Collins, noting that he was the primary player on David Coit. ""Great to see Matt [Nicholson] playing like that,"" Collins said. ""He's working, putting the time in and it's paying off. He and Boo are connecting."" ""Really pleased with the win tonight."" Chris Collins said. ""Lot of respect over there in Northern Illinois,"" he said acknowledging Zarique Nutter, Xavie Amos, David Coit and Konan Niederhai. The Huskies were no match for Boo Buie and the Wildcats. Heading into Purdue off a blowout win sure is nice. Northwestern takes down Northern Illinois 89-67. It seemed this game could go any way at the half, but the 'Cats were playing on another level out of the break. Buie had 16 points in the second frame alone. Remember when NIU had a lead? 83-61, Northwestern has stored this one away. Unlike the first half, the Wildcats have severely outplayed the Huskies. Boo Buie has erupted in the second half, adding 16 points in 13 minutes. Nicholson scores its first points of the second half on a pair of free throws. Despite Northwestern leading 71-57, Xavier Amos is having a career day for Northern Illinois reaching a high of 23 points against the 'Cats. Luke Hunger joins in on the scoring to make it 64-52. Northwestern last had a double-digit lead nearly 17 minutes ago. But with 14:14 remaining, the 'Cats are up 61-50. NU is pouring on the threes. Langborg and Berry have one, and Buie has two. Its 57-48, the offense has heated up again. Buie is hot out of the break, sinking a three to make it 51-48. It took less than two minutes, but NU has restored its lead 48-46. Ryan Langborg sinks a three for his first basket of the night. With two free throws Boo Buie joins Matt Nicholson and Nick Martinelli with nine points. NIU strikes first, 44-41. Big Matt is in the midst of a strong game, with nine points and four rebounds for the 'Cats. Xavior Amos has been lethal for the Huskies putting up 19 points. Meanwhile, Nicholson and Martinelli have both put up nine. Despite Northwestern having a double-digit lead, Northern Illinois ends the half up one at 42-41. Barnhizer makes one of two, but the one-point lead is erased by the Huskies off a jumper from Zarique Nutter who has nine on the night. It's tied at 40 with less than a minute left, as Brooks Barnhizer heads to the foul line. After trading baskets to tie up the score twice, NU has gotten out to a 36-32 lead. Less than three in the first frame left. On an optimistic note: Ty Berry is back in the game. At 27-26, NIU has its first lead of the game. Folks, it's 26-25. Five minutes ago the 'Cats had a ten-point advantage. After nearly two minutes without a bucket (and two missed NU free throws), the Huskies add another to make it 26-22. 26-20 with less than eight in the half. The Huskies are inching themselves closer to the 'Cats. Ty Berry fell awkwardly off a shot and has not yet returned from the locker room. Granted a free throw, Blake Preston took the shot in his place. The 'Cats lead by double digits thanks to an alley-oop by Blake Preston from Boo Buie and a three from Ty Berry. 21-11 with less than 12 minutes left in the half. A dunk from Ty Berry,a  three from Brooks Barnhizer and a shot from Nick Martinelli makes it 16-9. Matt Nicholson has seven of NU's nine points. On its sixth attempt up the court, Northern Illinois made its first shot but still trails 7-2. Takes a few back and forths, but Boo Buie puts the 'Cats on the board first, 2-0. The Huskies get the tip-off but miss their shot to start. Follow along with the 'Cats' first post-Thanksgiving game, as Northwestern men's basketball takes on Northern Illinois. Follow along as Northwestern men’s basketball takes on Northern Illinois. “Many Northwestern fans considered 2023 to be a year worth fast-forwarding, circling Nov. 26 on their calendars to get through the throes of another miserable season. Instead, that day has arrived, and...few want this year to end,” writes . That wraps up today's pressers from Champaign. Wallace called the safety room ""one of the deepest rooms we have on the team.""

""Working to get each other better. Being joyed with your brother making the play.""

Noted that that cohesion started in the spring.

Called Jaheem Joseph's interception ""amazing.""

""It's awesome."" Wallace on getting extra practice: ""It's kind of new for me having this bowl schedule. Not exactly sure what it's going to look like yet. Excited to be with the guys."" Wallace on ST rebounding from last week: ""I don't know if we changed that much. Every single week, we come in ready to attack each week. Come into meetings ready to learn and see what our coordinators have to say. Really just dominating what you're doing, and what's your role."" Wallace on the special teams room: ""I think it just goes to show the brotherhood we have as a team in general. Through the hardship we had this year. Special teams are a lot of the guys that aren't getting huge minutes. They're really a core of what it means to be a Wildcat."" Wallace on being ready on special teams: ""I think for me, I don't have a huge role on the defense right now. I'm just making the most of my opportunities when they're presented to me. Trying to max out my speed.""

Said he had the best speed last week on special teams. Wallace on his touchdown: ""It was insane. My sister's committed here for basketball. My whole family was here. It was ridiculous. I got the ball, and I was like, 'Can I return this?'""

Noted that his mentality was to not get tackled. Henning: ""Shoutout Ben Bryant."" Henning on the offense staying resilient: ""It's huge when a big special teams play is made, when a huge defensive play is made. It brings so much life and momentum when it happens. We want to put points on the board that much more. We've got to take advantage of that."" Henning on watching the two-point try/onside kicks: ""It was the mentality of, 'Anything can happen at any point.' There was no flinch in us on the sideline. We had faith in those guys, as they have faith in us, to make the play when it happens. We just trust our fundamentals."" Henning on beating Illinois as a state native: ""Being from Illinois, the rivalry is just huge. Ending their season, that wasn't on our radar. We're focused on us, playing our best brand of football.""

Gave a shoutout to Lincoln-Way East. Henning on rivalry games: ""It means a lot. Every game is big. Once it's for a trophy or a rivalry game, that much more.""

Said he learned that NU hadn't had the HAT in two years, and ""how much it meant to the older guys.""

""It's a big deal."" Henning on Cam Johnson: ""The receiver room, we push each other to be the best. We don't know who's going to make the play. He's played a lot football. He's one heck of a ballplayer."" Henning on making decisions to return: ""It just kind of comes from coaches and schemes. Over the course of the game, might be a little more conservative than aggressive."" Henning on Bryant: ""He's like another coach on the field. He's a field general. He takes charge, and he sees the field really well.""

Shouted him out by wearing his merchandise pre- and postgame. A.J. Henning and Garner Wallace also set to speak shortly. That wraps up Johnson. Johnson on where he wants to play: ""Just somewhere warm."" Johnson on communication with Bryant: ""I think it's sort of an unspoken bond. He sort of felt that I was in a groove. He just kept feeding me the ball."" Johnson on what he's shown: ""That I'm able to play with the best of the best. I think that I've been able to put that on display week after week, no matter who we're playing against.""

Praised the entire team, and both Bryant and Brendan Sullivan. Johnson on offensive resilience: ""I think that we realized that it wasn't Illinois stopping us a lot of the time. It was ourselves beat."" Johnson says that he's never won a rivalry game he's played in.

""I think it just means a ton. I've been through a lot of adversity in my college career. I think this team has been through a lot of adversity as well."" Johnson on his TD streak: ""It's meant a lot to me to sort of see my ability to help the team win. Finding ways to help the team, whether that be blocking...or going out and scoring. I wouldn't trade it for the world."" Johnson on his career-best day: ""It was definitely special. This is one of the best teams and favorite teams I've ever been a part of, especially in college football."" Cam Johnson now up. That's all from Bryant. Bryant on the HAT: ""It means a lot for multiple reasons. It's so nice to go out like this to end the regular season. To get the HAT back is huge."" Bryant on the second pick: ""We had two go routes on both sides. I just threw it up to him.""

Said Bajakian told him not to worry about it.

""It wasn't the end of the world."" Bryant on returning from the first pick: ""That sucks. No one wants to throw a pick-six. We knew we were going to have another chance to go down and get the ball. Nobody had a sour look on their face."" Bryant on Cam Johnson: ""Cam's a great dude. He works so hard. I'm so happy to see his success on the field. That comes with growth through our chemistry."" Bryant: ""We were just executing. We were throwing and catching the ball well. I'm really proud of the offense and how we executed today.""

Praised the pass and run game. Ben Bryant now up. Braun said the HAT was a ""little bit lighter"" and ""not as dense"" as the Dakota Marker, but that ""both feel good in your hands."" Braun on making a statement: ""I don't know if the motivation came from ending their season. Today was a great step up for us in terms of the recruiting trail. We have to be great in the Chicagoland area. We have to be great in the state of Illinois."" Braun on bowl game destinations: ""Any opportunity to go play football with this group, we're gonna be thrilled about.""

Called it a ""spring ball come early"" in terms of the ability to ""help the entire program develop and move forward."" Braun on resetting Bryant after the first pick: ""I said the same thing that I said to all those guys coming off the field. 'Guys, it's on to the next.' We have a tendency to harp on what just happened. Let's learn from what just happened, and put it behind us."" ""To me, the absolute best offenses and defenses are built in concepts that allow...coaches to get out of bad calls. That requires great teaching throughout the week, and a trust within your players."" Braun on Ben Bryant: ""Offensive, we've done a great job of valuing the football all year long. A couple plays that he'd like to have back for sure.""

Praised his ""confidence"" and ""rhythm,"" plus ""trust"" among teammates. Stressed line of scrimmage adjustments. ""Isn't that how Big Ten West football... No? That's not it?"" Braun joked about the combined 88 points. Braun on scoring 45 points: ""Efficiency leads to explosiveness.""

Mentioned double-move routes. Braun on his message to keep momentum: ""I've gotten better at it. I still need to do a better job of removing myself rom the defensive play-caller mode.""

Said he preached staying the course.

""This group continues to find different ways to win football games."" Braun on Cam Johnson: ""He just embodied so many of the things that we value in this program. He's a warrior. Battles through nicks and bruises. Continues to improve."" On Olsen making from 45 earlier: ""He's such a competitor. He's been so consistent this year. He's a master of his craft.""

Also praised Will Halkyard and Hunter Renner.

Called the kick ""absolutely critical."" Braun on the late delay of game decision: ""That was a difficult decision. A lot went into it. His last kick just cleared the uprights. The trajectory of his ball was coming out a little bit lower than it typically does.""

Mentioned that the team wanted to avoid a block. Braun on winning the HAT: ""It's really neat. The two things we wanted to leave no doubt about were finishing the regular season the right away.. We wanted to leave no doubt that we wanted to bring the HAT back. I'm just so happy for that locker room right now."" Braun: ""This team found a way to come home with the HAT."" Braun: ""Just such a credit to our entire team.""

Noted that parts of the defense ""were not up to our standard,"" but that the collective effort was ""winning football.""

Called Ben Bryant and the offense ""gusty."" Braun's opening statement: ""Wow. What a game. Really proud of that group in there.""

Talked about there being a ""lot of reason to not have laser focus"" after being bowl eligible, but NU staying the course.

""Winning rivalry games is never easy."" David Braun set to speak to the media shortly from Champaign. The Wildcats’ offense was humming all day, especially courtesy of Cam Johnson. HAT secured. FINAL: Northwestern 45, Illinois 43

A combined 88 points. A tip on a game-tying two-point try. And the HAT is back home.

Cam Johnson had a career-best day to propel the 'Cats, who have seven wins. On the second try, Northwestern recovers! That's it! Braun uses his final timeout. Offside on the receiving team. Unbelievable.

They're kicking again. Northwestern recovers the onside kick, and that's it!

However, there's a penalty. Braun burns another TO before the kick. Illinois will now attempt an onside kick. If the 'Cats recover, they win. Paddock's pass falls incomplete! The flag is picked up! Braun calls timeout before the two-point play.

It's 45-43 NU with 55 seconds left. Touchdown, Illinois. Paddock finds Washington on a catch and run.

Yes, this is real life. Paddock is *nearly* picked on first down. Renner's punt rolls into the end zone.

Illinois down eight with 1:14 left, and 80 yards to go. Uhhh, Northwestern is called for delay of game.

So, Olsen won't come out.",428,2023-11-26 00:00:20,2023-12-02 19:42:00
49,"“It’s hard to contend that Northwestern shouldn’t already be looking to its 2024 roster via the portal’s first window — attracting impact players as early as possible while still maintaining its priorities of fit and character,” writes . In two weeks, Northwestern will take the turf at Allegiant Stadium to play Utah in the Las Vegas Bowl. Before then, get up to speed with the program’s bowl history, for all of its ups and downs. Shohei Ohtani is actually a Northwestern Wildcat Priebe is the fourth ‘Cat to enter the transfer portal. Yet, leaves a return open if Kurt Anderson is retained. 

While injuries derailed his last two seasons, Priebe played nearly every snap this season, finishing with a 61.2 blocking grade from PFF. 

Best of luck to No. 68! Another upset means another long basketball pod episode, which means Episode 2 of Rock Fight: It's OK the Cubs can keep Cody Bellinger now The three EICs of this site would like you to know that the Yankees are indeed back Williams is the third Wildcat to enter the transfer portal. The DB played 175 special teams snaps over the last three years, but only saw time in Weeks 1-4 this year. “Pick your poison for which upset was bigger, but these two wins are just the beginning of the story Northwestern basketball is writing,” writes @ACBSports18. One thing’s for sure...Northwestern will have its hands full with an impressive Utah team: The weekly NFL check-in features a new face and some strong performances. Eight Wildcats joined Katie Ledecky at the 2023 U.S. Open Championships last week. Freeman is now the second Wildcat to enter the portal. He played in three games for the 'Cats last year, and has consistently drawn praise for his scout team work. Northwestern moves up to 29th in the newest AP Poll. Big Ten teams ahead include Purdue (No. 4), Illinois (No. 20, Wisconsin (23) and Ohio State (27). McKeown mentions not wanting to overload players between now and the Maryland game next Sunday due to Finals Week.

Notes that the quarter system makes it difficult because the only period in which the players don't have class is between next weekend and before Christmas. McKeown on why the 'Cats seem to start slow: 

""We seem to be waiting around defensively...we got to rebound the ball, that'll let us get out and run a little more."" McKeown on utilizing a deep bench (had 10 different scorers today):

""Didn't help us today...It certainly is going to help us down the road."" McKeown on starting Alana Goodchild over Caileigh Walsh: 

""She has a scorer's mentality, and we've been struggling to score the ball."" McKeown in his opening statement: ""We got to find players that want to rebound the basketball."" McKeown mentions having opportunities to fight back in the third quarter, but not converting on chances. Joe McKeown now stepping up to the podium. McWilliams on being out-rebounded: ""It's about toughness. We're being soft in there."" McWilliams on starting slow: ""We just got to come out and be ready to play."" Pina on getting open looks from three: ""[My teammates] were just able to find me a lot easier this game."" Jasmine McWilliams and Maggie Pina head to the podium to kick off the presser. A four game losing streak heading into Big Ten play is...not ideal. FINAL: Georgetown 82, Northwestern 58. 

It was all Hoyas this afternoon, as they managed to out-rebound NU, 35-25, and got to the line 12 more times.

The 'Cats drop to 3-5 on the season. They'll kick off conference play against Maryland a week from today. With 1:35 left to go and Georgetown up by 22, the Hoyas put in their substitutes. 

This one looks about over. Caileigh Walsh is making it happen for the 'Cats.

She fought for a jump ball on defense and turned the following possession into two made layups at the free throw line. She has 13 on the day.

77-55, Hoyas. One step forward, two steps back.

Coming out of the timeout, Georgetown scores a bucket under the basket, Lau turns it over, and the Hoyas drain a floater. CASEY HARTER NAILS A THREE ASSISTED BY LAU.

'Cats have cut the lead to 15, and there's 6:57 left. Through 1:30 of this quarter, defense has been stifling on both ends.

68-50, Hoyas ahead. The third quarter comes to a close, and the 'Cats find themselves down 20.

Lau, Walsh and Weaver continue to put together solid offensive outings, but turnovers and a lack of rebounds has put NU in a tough hole to climb out of. Northwestern has started to play a very aggressive press, and it seems to be working.

Georgetown has turned it over a few times now from the double- and triple-teams. Lau drains a three to cut the deficit to 19. Coming out of the timeout, Joe McKeown subs the whole lineup.

Most of the starters are coming in with 3:31 left in Q3. Maggie Pina connects on a *difficult* three.

Looks like she might've even drawn a foul on it, but nothing gets called.

62-38, 'Cats trail. NU pushes it in transition as Ademusayo finishes with a nice layup.

Georgetown comes down the court with an answer of its own.

57-35, Hoyas. Weaver scores a TOUGH floater. 

She's looked excellent today. During the timeout, they just had a fan play a game based on whether or not Paige Mott could name more than six sports in 15 seconds...

Hammering the over. Mercy Ademusayo gets her first points of the day on a layup that was nicely assisted by McWilliams. Weaver gets big to score the 'Cats' first points of the period, driving down the lane through a few defenders.

53-29, Georgetown. Third quarter is underway, and it starts with a Hailey Weaver three rimming out.

Georgetown takes it down the court and scores on a jumper. Northwestern had five defensive rebounds in the first half. Georgetown had 12 offensive boards.

That'll need to change in these last two quarters to keep NU in this. That wraps up Braun's presser. Braun said he was in his office when he heard that NU was headed to Vegas. More: ""I think it's really important that we take that opportunity to reflect on what this group has achieved and the story has written together.

""It's really special. Today is one of those days we have to take a step back and recognize the opportunity this is for the program."" Braun on what today was like: ""I don't know if I've had a chance to really take that deep breath and enjoy it. I look forward to that post-bowl game with [my] family."" Braun noted A.J. Henning, Ben Bryant, Richie Hagarty, Cam Johnson as examples of not necessarily being the highest-ranked transfers, but ones that fit well with Northwestern. He added: ""It's being intentional about the things that matter right now, and that starts with doing a great job with connecting with our current roster while also identifying our needs."" Braun on the impact of the portal and staff additions looming on bowl prep: ""It's fluid. It's not easy, there's a lot going on. Referencing back to the staffing of this program, the staffing within our recruiting and staffing will look different from the amount of people."" Braun:  ""I see [the bowl game] as an opportunity to put an exclamation point on this season."" He mentioned his NDSU experience, and prepping for playoff games with a national title on the line. Braun on the difference in between a bowl and true road game: ""It's tremendously different. 

""We're going to ensure that everyone in the program has an opportunity to enjoy this experience. And to be honest, that's a little different from what I'm accustomed to."" Fitting for the way this game has gone so far, Georgetown benefits from a bad NU possession and nails a three-pointer to close the half.

It's been all Hoyas through 20 minutes. They lead 51-27. Braun on recruiting and making additions: ""I'm really excited about the opportunity we have to move forward. There's balance in all that.""

Shouted out multiple members of the program in the building (Bryan Payton, Lauren McCree, etc.) on the recruiting side. Walsh's three rims out, and Harter nabs the rebound. 

She goes up for a contested put-back but doesn't get the call. Braun continues to praise Utah: ""Haven't had much of an opportunity to watch much of them. But the one thing I can say is, you know you're going to get a team that plays complementary football, a team that plays physical football."" Walsh heads to the line and hits both. 

48-27, Georgetown leads. Braun on seeing Whittingham in the 2009 Sugar Bowl: ""I remember that game vividly. I remember as a young coach, walking the halls at a GAs coaching convention, and being like, 'Hey, that's Coach Whittingham.'""

Praised Utah's developmental system. GTown is playing with pace, and it looks to be tiring the ‘Cats out. 

Trips to the free throw line have become commonplace in this second period. 

46-25, Hoyas. Braun said he doesn't anticipate any Northwestern player opting out for the Vegas Bowl.

Emphasized transparency and communication in those conversations. Weaver draws a foul on a shot in the paint. 

She sinks one at the line, narrowing the lead to 17. Said the team had the day off today with finals coming up and staff members on the road for recruiting. Braun on talking to the other coaches and players about going to Vegas: ""The only thing I've seen is some of these group chats absolutely buzzing when the news came out."" Kelsey Ransom has scored 15 for Georgetown in the first 17 minutes of play. A major problem for this ‘Cats defense. 

42-24, Hoyas. Braun on using the bowl game prep as a developmental opportunity for the entire roster: ""It's unique. December 23rd is an awfully early bowl game. Great benefit as well. We're two practices in, which were utilized for development of our entire roster."" Noted their Pac-12 title game win last season as a model of ""winning football."" Scoring is ramping up now, as the teams are trading shots. 

The difference maker is second-chance points. On nearly every possession, Georgetown is getting an ORB or trip to the free throw line. 

38-22, Hoyas. Braun on facing Kyle Whittingham: ""It'll be a tremendous challenge. I don't think Coach Whittingham knows this, but I'll commonly use the Utah program model as one I admire.""

Said he did professional development at Utah, and developed respect for the way the program was built. Braun doesn't anticipate staff changes before the bowl game.

""No decisions have been made on staffing. We started this thing off together, and we fully anticipate on December 23rd we'll have this group together."" Mott gets charged with her third foul and heads to the bench.

Georgetown converts an and-one. 

34-18, Hoyas. Braun: ""This group certainly is thrilled, and knows there's a lot of work ahead to be ready and at our best on the 23rd."" David Braun's bowl game presser starting now. Northwestern is pressing now. HUSTLE. 

Lau takes a few threes, misses both, Weaver collects the ORBs before Pina coverts on a deep shot. 

31-18, GTown. Mott opens scoring for NU in the second quarter. Georgetown answers right back. 

31-15, Hoyas. The Hoyas nail their fifth three of the day. 

27-13, Northwestern trails. The second quarter opens with a foul on the ‘Cats. 

Georgetown sinks both free throws, extending its lead to 11. The first quarter ends as NU seems to be finding a footing on offense. 

22-13, Georgetown leads. Caileigh Walsh makes her first shot of the day — a nice jumper. 

22-13, ‘GTown. After cashing in on two three-pointers, Lau has missed two tough contested layups. 

22-11, ‘Hoyas. HEAT CHECK. 

LAU SPLASHES A DEEP THREE WITH A HAND IN HER FACE. 

18-11, ‘Hoyas. Lau responds with Northwestern’s first three of the day. 

18-8, GTown. Paige Mott gets called for a foul, and with the Hoyas already in the bonus, they’ll go to the line. 16-5* With 3:42 left in Q1, Georgetown leads Northwestern, 17-4. Officially, it’ll be the Wildcats and the Utes squaring off on Dec. 23 from Vegas. BREAKING: Northwestern is Vegas-bound! It’s a rematch of the 2018 Holiday Bowl out west with the Utes.",89,2023-12-03 20:26:43,2023-12-09 17:55:50
50,"Barnhizer coming alive...

No. 13 drills a triple then takes one away and lays it in to make it 42-34 NU with 12:32 left in the game. 'Cats force two straight turnovers on the defensive end, but comes up empty on offense.

Two straight misses from Buie. Berry loses control of the ball and turns it over back to the Blue Demons.

Collins sits him immediately. LANGBUCKET.

His fourth-triple of the night gives NU a 37-31 lead at the first media timeout of the half. Another bad possession of offense leads to Berry chucking up a three as the shot clock expires. Langborg hits a triple and a lay-in from Buie pushes NU's lead to five, but Depaul answers right back with a layup. Nicholson picks up his third foul a minute into the half. Barnhizer gets the roll for his first bucket of the day, but Depaul answers right back with a slam. Food for thought: There have been more half-court shots made by fans at Northwestern games than threes by the Wildcats in that first half. Northwestern's offense through 20 minutes. Northwestern starting five  
Buie: 4 points 
Berry: 0 points 
Langborg: 6 points 
Barnhizer: 1 point 
Nicholson: 2 points  

A combined 2-for-14 from beyond the arc.

A horrid output in the first half. Something needs to change quickly. Buie tries to make something happen, but loses his footing and the ball goes out of bounds.

25-25 at the break. 'Cats on upset alert once again. And-one from the Blue Demons ties it up at 25 with 20 seconds left in the half. Northwestern has 25 points, with Martinelli accounting for 50% of the scoring.

I, for one, did not see that coming. Clayton dribbles it off his knee and it goes out of bounds.

'Cats lead 23-18 with three minutes left in the half. BOO BUIE MAKES A LAYUP, AND MARTINELLI MAKES A THREE

POINTS!!!!! Make it 0-18 The teams are 0-17 from the field since 12 minutes in the half. Can we make a no-three-pointer rule until a layup is made? Barnhizer is 0-7 from the floor, including 0-5 from three.

'Cats have not scored in three and a half minutes, yet still lead 18-16. Northwestern from three-point range. Berry misses a three, but Depaul can't connect from deep either.

Teams are a combined 5-21 from three. Barnhizer splits a pair, but the ball bounces off Depaul and out of bounds.

Yet, the 'Cats cannot convert on the extra possession on another missed three. 

NU is now just 2-10 from beyond the arc, with Langborg being the only one to make a triple. Great defense from the 'Cats forces a shot-clock violation.

On the other side, Barnhizer grabs an offensive board and draws another foul. Martinelli makes both. Game is being moved to FS1. Mad scramble for the ball somehow ends up with a full court pass to Martinelli, who draws contact and will shoot two after the media timeout.

15-14 NU. Langborg rattles in another 3, his and NU's second of the game. Berry replaces Clayton, and he gets beat to the rim. Martinelli grabs two straight offensive boards and finishes through contact for an and-one.

12-12. Martinelli hits his signature floater to even the score at 9, but another 3 from Depaul puts it ahead 12-9. Buie goes to the rim uncontrolled and loses the ball, but he is able to fall on it and call a timeout.

'Cats looking shaky again nearly halfway through the first frame Blue Demon's three gives them a 9-7 lead. Barnhizer misses another right at the rim, although the Blue Demons swarmed him. Nick Martinelli comes in to spell him

Have to wonder if that wrap on Barnhizer's hand is harming his touch. Jordan Clayton replaces Berry after the break and instantly picks up his first foul. Nicholson throws down the alley-top to give NU a 7-6 lead at the first media timeout.

'Cats ball out of the break. Barnhizer smokes a fast break layup.

No. 13 has struggled out of the gate. Langborg's first shot is good from beyond the arc.

5-3 NU three minutes into the game. Barnhizer draws a foul on the floor but turns it over right after.  

Blue Demons can't capitalize on the opposite end. Buie answers right back with a finish at the rim. Depaul wins the tip and nails a three to open the scoring. Game will start on FS2 at 5:40. Tipoff pushed to 5:40 as FS1 is still showing the conclusion of St. Johns vs Fordham. Today's starters for NU

No changes for Chris Collins after Wednesday's debacle. A must-win in mid-December.

Not great. With the Las Vegas Bowl fast approaching,  and  have the intel you need to know about how Northwestern matches up with Utah — plus offer their thoughts on the Wildcats’ lack of changes so far. ,  and  detail a horrific Wednesday night of Northwestern basketball in an emergency episode of Rock Fight. Northwestern volleyball fell short of its aspirations this season, but an influx of young talent brings hope for a better future.

With new leadership taking over the program, the ‘Cats have the pieces to make some noise in 2024. With the Las Vegas Bowl occurring in only nine days, take a look back at the last time Northwestern and Utah squared off — coincidentally, also in a bowl game. While it may have been a few weeks ago, Ben Bryant’s performance was a key factor to the Wildcats' reclamation of the HAT. “To have a 3-9 team go on those types of stretches multiple times in a matchup is bad enough. But what’s more frightening is that long lapses have become commonplace for Northwestern, which has routinely played down to competition,” writes . Northwestern has now lost one of the more shocking games of the 2023-24 college basketball season. FINAL: Chicago State 75, No. 25 Northwestern 73

Wesley Cardet Jr. was way too much for the Wildcats to handle, accruing 30 points. Boo Buie had 23, and Ryan Langborg posted 18, but it still wasn't enough.

That ranking will be no more. Successful inbound by Chicago State, and that's it. Buie hits a quick runner, but there's less than a second left, and Northwestern is still losing by two.

The 'Cats will need a true miracle. Barnhizer's pass is knocked away by Cardet, and there are only five seconds left. Still NU ball. Neal makes the second. Northwestern trails by four with 6.4 left.

Yes, you need a three here. Neal misses the first. Still life. Chicago State successfully inbounds, and Berry commits a foul with 6.4 left. Buie makes both free throws. 74-71 Cougars, and Collins calls TO with 7.3 left. Need a steal here, realistically. Crawford makes two free throws, and the Cougars foul up by five with 7.3 left. Berry misses an open three, and Northwestern is still down three with 9.7 left. Neal makes both. 72-69 Chicago State with 16.3 left. The Wildcats couldn't successfully foul on their first try, and A.J. Neal will finally head to the line with 16.3 left. One-point game. After review, Barnhizer did indeed touch it last. Chicago State ball. Buie's floater is no good, and Chicago State recovers it. Play is under review.

19.7 seconds left. Chicago State's bucket is taken away after the ruling that Cardet was out. 'Cats can take the lead. Buie hits both. It's 70-69 Chicago State. Buie slips but is awarded a foul. He'll head to the line with the Wildcats losing by three, and only 64 seconds left. Buie misses a layup, and Cardet splashes a three over Nicholson. Wow. Cardet weaves his way in and now has 27 (!) points. All knotted up. Northwestern’s sixth-straight loss was the result of a familiar problem: a very slow start. MBB: Buie gets to his spot, goes high off the glass and gets it to go! Northwestern leads 67-65, and CSU calls timeout.

Terrific play by Barnhizer on the other end to set it up. MBB: Who else but Buie to tie things up with a quick cut and layup. Three minutes left. MBB: Berry stepped out of bounds on the inbound, and the Cougars have it.

14th turnover of the night for NU. MBB: Buie misses a floater, but the 'Cats will keep it after the under-4. Cougars lead the Wildcats 65-63.

Just 3:53 separates Northwestern from what would be an incomprehensible loss. MBB: Nicholson misses the free throw. Still a two-point hole with 4:13 to go. MBB: Northwestern beats the press and finds Nicholson, who rolls to the rim and finishes through the whistle. The big man has a chance to cut the lead to one. WBB: FINAL: DePaul 90, Northwestern 65

An encouraging second half from the 'Cats, who actually outscored DePaul over the final two frames, but a slow start proved to be way too much to overcome.

It's shaping up to be an all-time night of Northwestern basketball. MBB: Corbett makes one. It's now 65-61 Chicago State. MBB: Berry has it stripped away, and Buie fouls Corbett. MBB: Davis is good on both. Chicago State leads Northwestern 64-61 with 5:17 left. MBB: Davis knocks it away from Buie and is fouled. Northwestern has 12 turnovers.

The Cougars are enjoying an 8-0 run at the perfect time. MBB: Northwestern turns it over on the inbound, and the Cougars have retaken the lead on a Cardet slam. Unbelievable. MBB: After two NU misses, Cardet hits a three of his own. The Northwestern advantage is only one. MBB: Brent Davis drills a difficult three, and the Cougars have life. It's back to a four-point lead. MBB: Langborg is fouled and makes one. It's 61-54 'Cats with 7:35 left. WBB: With under five minutes to play, DePaul still leads by 29 points despite a solid second-half offensive output from the 'Cats. It should be all but over. MBB: Cardet makes a layup. He's up to 20 points, and that takes us to the under-8. Northwestern clinging to a 60-54 lead.

The 'Cats have made six of their last 10 shots, which has sparked a major turnaround in this second half. MBB: Martinelli gets on the board with two from the line, and the NU lead has increased to eight. MBB: Chicago State has made one of its last eight field goals, and Jernigan has fouled out. A critical loss for a Cougars lineup that's already small. MBB: Barnhizer is starting to find it. The junior works down low and gets the hook shot to go. MBB: Cardet finishes through contact over Barnhizer after a change from a charge to a block. He makes the free throw, and it's back to a four-point game. MBB: Barnhizer again splits, and it's 56-49 Northwestern with 10:35 left. MBB: Out of the media timeout, Barnhizer hits one free throw, but immediately draws another two after a strong offensive rebound. MBB: Barnhizer draws a foul to take us to the under-12, plus put Northwestern in the bonus.

Chicago State hasn't made a bucket in almost six minutes of game action, which has fueled a 54-49 NU lead.

Ryan Langborg has 17, while Boo Buie has tacked on 13. MBB: After a made free throw from CSU, Buie gets an impressive teardrop to fall. Still a five-point lead for the 'Cats with 11:25 to go. WBB: END OF THIRD: DePaul 72, Northwestern 47

The 'Cats outscore the Blue Demons, and excel on the offensive end, shooting 59% on the quarter. Caroline Lau and Casey Harter shined in particular, combining for 18 of NU's 28 points. MBB: The bottom of the net has No. 5's number handy. He hits his FIFTH triple, and the 'Cats have a five-point lead. MBB: Berry banks in a ridiculous, last-second three to give the Wildcats back the lead! Unreal way for him to get on the scoreboard. WBB: The 'Cats really showing signs of life now, and Lau is excelling on both on ends. A nice block on a layup for her. NU is 6 of its last 7 from the field. MBB: Langborg converts a J after a nice steal by Martinelli, and Chicago State has called timeout.

First real surge in momentum for the 'Cats since the early portions of the evening. MBB: Barnhizer weaves his way in, draws contact and goes 1-for-2 from the stripe. Now a three-point matchup. MBB: Corbett sinks two from the line. Chicago State has doubled its advantage and is leading by four with 14:56 remaining. MBB: Langborg hits his fourth three of the game after the timeout. Lead is cut to two. WBB: A 7-0 run for the 'Cats, as Lau has caught fire with another three and a layup. DePaul takes a timeout with 3:35 left in the third, with its lead standing at 63-39. MBB: At the under-16, it's Chicago State 45, Northwestern 40.

The Wildcats are 1-for-5 in the second half, while CSU is 3-for-7. Collins' squad has seemed in scramble mode for much of this one, and has its back against the wall. WBB: A three from Lau for her first points of the night, only for Sidor to bury her fifth trey. It's a 29-point ballgame. MBB: Barnhizer erases the goose egg with a spinning layup. MBB: The Wildcats STILL haven't scored in this second half, and following two straight turnovers, the Cougars are up 45-38. MBB: Crawford converts two free throws, and the Cougars lead by five with 17:05 to go in this ballgame.

You read that right. WBB: A couple of buckets from Daley and Harter are answered by two three-pointers from Sidor, who now has four treys (and hasn't missed). DePaul holds its 53-27 edge as the 'Cats take a timeout. MBB: Not even the shot clock is working right in Welsh-Ryan Arena. WBB: A good start to the second half for the 'Cats, as Harter gets on the board with a layup. However, Mott picks up her fourth foul soon after, which should send her to the bench for at least a little while. MBB: Buie's off on a floater, and Cameron Jernigan slams it in.

Chris Collins calls timeout with the 'Cats trailing 41-38. Northwestern hasn't scored in 2:16 of this half. MBB: After a missed dunk from Buie, Cardet makes a layup and takes contact. He'll head to the line.

That type of night in Evanston. WBB (and MBB): Second halves are underway. *whispers* if Northwestern MBB doesn't turn this half around, Seth Meyers will have painful things to joke about WBB: HALF: DePaul 47, Northwestern 19

18 turnovers. The Blue Demons end the half on a 23-2 run. Northwestern goes the last 3:08 without scoring. Not good. MBB: HALF: No. 25 Northwestern 38, Chicago State 37

A 10-0 run by CSU tightened things in a big way to close the first 20 minutes. What also didn't help were seven turnovers by the 'Cats.

Boo Buie has 11, and Ryan Langborg has added nine. Wesley Cardet Jr. has been impressive. WBB: Two free throws from Harter break a 17-0 drought, but DePaul is scorching hot. Blue Demons are 10 of their last 11 from the field, and are up to 58% overall on the night. MBB: Buie quells the visiting 10-0 run with a quick-trigger three. Lead back to NU. MBB: Noble Crawford knocks away a lax pass from Nick Martinelli, and goes coast to coast. The Cougars now lead. WBB: It is *another* 15-0 run for DePaul after a Shakara McCline triple. Blue Demons lead 39-17. MBB: Corbett has scored CSU's last eight points, and all of a sudden, it's tied at 33-33. MBB: At the under-4, Northwestern is holding on to a narrow 33-31 lead over Chicago State.

This one is starting to take the shape of previous non-con games earlier this year, where the Wildcats haven't fully seized control.

Additionally, Ty Berry is scoreless so far. MBB: Corbett hits again, and it's suddenly a two-point affair. The Cougars are 5-for-14 from three. MBB: Jahsean Corbett drills a far three, and the Cougars are down just five. WBB: Another one (this time off McWilliams) leads to another Gilbert bucket, and an NU timeout. Blue Demons lead by 15 with 6:08 left in the first half. WBB: Two quick buckets from Walsh, but Peoples and Gilbert follow it up with steals-and-scores. DePaul lead is back to 13, and NU has 12 turnovers already. MBB: Berry throws a beautiful lob to Nicholson, who flushes it. 31-25 'Cats with 5:24 to go in the first half. WBB: Paige Mott picks up her third foul early in the second quarter. McKeown running a Lau-Daley-Harter-Walsh-Jasmine McWilliams lineup now. MBB: Cardet nails a jumper, and the Cougars only are down six. Chicago State is hanging around so far. WBB: CASEY HARTER AND-ONE! Back to single digits. She made some big second-quarter plays on Sunday to bring NU back from an early deficit at Maryland, and the 'Cats will need her again. WBB: Three straight offensive rebounds from DePaul to open the second quarter, and it culminates in a Gilbert bucket. That encapsulates the action thus far, as it's 22-10 DePaul. MBB: Nicholson lays one in and adds the foul, so the senior will try to finish the and-one following a short pause.

Northwestern's defense has been stingy early, notching five turnovers. WBB: END OF FIRST: DePaul 20, Northwestern 10

A buzzer-beating Mel Daley three was a bright spot, but the Wildcats committed ten (10) turnovers in one quarter. Really tough to win that way. Daley leads NU with five points. MBB: Cardet just threw one down in ferocious fashion. My goodness. Finally, Maggie Pina breaks the drought with a three-pointer. 18-5 Blue Demons. WBB: It is an 18-0 run for DePaul now after a Sidor three. For context, Northwestern's start against Omaha was historic, and that was a 17-0 run (in NU's favor). MBB: At the under-12, Northwestern leads Chicago State 22-12, but the Cougars will head to the free throw line following the break.

Langborg and Buie have nine and seven, respectively. Meanwhile, Wesley Cardet Jr. has seven for CSU. *on an offensive foul MBB: Langborg is now 3-for-3 from three following a great dish from Buie. NU leading by eight. WBB: Lau picks up her fourth turnover of the game. There's 4:22 left in the first quarter, and DePaul leads 15-2. Northwestern hasn't scored in almost six minutes. MBB: Buie up to seven points, and we're not even a quarter of the way into the game. He nails a floater to make it 14-9 Northwestern. WBB: And-one for Katlyn Gilbert. DePaul now leads 13-2 with 6:36 in the first quarter, is on a 13-0 run, and is 5-of-6 from the field. Not great! Another bucket for Peoples, who has five points and a 10-2 lead. Northwestern has struggled mightily with starting fast, and this is Exhibit A. Three turnovers for the 'Cats already. MBB: Buie gets a trey of his own, and that takes us into the under-16 with the Wildcats leading 10-7. WBB: DePaul picks up eight points in a hurry, and Anaya Peoples is everywhere. 8-2 Blue Demons. MBB: A three from Ryan Langborg ties things up 7-7. Two turnovers already for the 'Cats. WBB: They're off in Chicago, and NU quickly gets on the board thanks to a bucket from Mott 12 seconds in. WBB starting lineup:

Caroline Lau
Hailey Weaver
Casey Harter
Caileigh Walsh
Paige Mott

When you're 7-1 and No. 25 in the country, little reason to change anything. The No. 25 Wildcats look to make it four wins in a row as they take on Chicago State from WRA. (Northwestern men’s basketball has beaten No. 1 Purdue twice before lacrosse lost a game) A rematch with the Orange is the only thing standing between the Lakeshow and a full calendar year of being undefeated Who should we trust — the AP, the NET, RPI, KenPom...or none of the above? As the ‘Cats prepare for postseason play, here are a few key matchups to watch in Las Vegas. Northwestern’s dynamic duo of Izzy Scane and Erin Coykendall were named the best two players in college women’s lacrosse by InsideLacrosse.

We're shocked. The 'Cats are making their presence felt on Lake Erie. On Sunday, Northwestern recorded its largest victory margin of the season. What can be learned from the ‘Cats’ 91-59 dismantling of Detroit Mercy? Northwestern women’s basketball had perhaps its best quarter of the season in Sunday’s loss to Maryland, but consistency is still the team’s biggest obstacle. With transfer season is in full swing, who are some of the players Northwestern could target in the portal? Ranked. Northwestern. Would be the first relatively big loss or change for David Braun's staff.

McShane, Northwestern's offensive director of recruiting, had been with the Wildcats since July 2018. He had worked with the Beavers before 2015 and is an OSU alum. David Braun will now be coaching in the same conference as his longtime mentor Entz, who will join the Trojans as they move to the Big Ten.

As the Bison look for a new coach, though, the good news is it won't be Braun — fresh off an extension and Coach of the Year award. As easy as a sleigh ride. FINAL: Northwestern sails to a 91-59 victory. 

Nick Martinelli led all scorers with a career high 22 points, and Berry and Langborg combined 8-13 from deep. 

Buie only had five points, but dished out eight assists. GUS THE BUS WITH THE HOOK SHOT!!

The bench goes wild. It is 87-54 Northwestern after a long two from Martinelli, giving him 20 points. 

I think the headband has to stay on for the foreseeable future. At the under 8, it is 76-48 Northwestern. 

Now the real question is whether Detroit Mercy will give up less points than Purdue?? Make that 74-47 after a bucket from Buie and Hunger. 

As  says, get your lawnmowers ready Ty Berry and-one and it is 70-47 The free throw is good, and No. 2 is up to 16 points. Martinelli and-one makes it 64-42 NU with 11:27 left in the game. 

Martinelli will have a chance to complete the three point play after the timeout OH MY GOD BIG MATT WITH THE REJECTION Berry and Langborg go back to back from beyond the arc to make it 58-35 NU. 

The pair has a combined 32 points. Berry with five in a row and NU leads by 19. 

Timeout UDM MBB: Barnhizer finds Nicholson for a wide open slam to make it 47-33. Second half about to begin at Welsh-Ryan. 

Starting five out on the floor Northwestern flashed some encouraging signs early, but couldn’t sustain them in a 71-58 loss out east: MBB: ‘Cats hold a 45-33 lead at the half. 

It is the most points by NU in the first half this season, and Buie only has one point. 

Martinelli and Langborg have combined for 27. WBB: FINAL: Maryland 71, Northwestern 58  
A pair of threes from Alana Goodchild make this a little closer than it appeared. NU flashed resilience in the second quarter, but ultimately, turnovers and shooting slumps allowed UMD to pull away and hand NU its fifth-straight loss. WBB: Rachel Mutombo getting her first minutes in purple and white! MBB: RYAN LANGBORG IS SCORCHING HOT!!

He hits his fourth three of the half to give him 16. 

40-28 NU MBB: Langborg put the ‘Cats on his back, splashing his third three of the game to end a near 4 minute field goal drought, giving NU a 37-26 lead with 3:30 left in the half WBB: A crafty layup from Lau cuts the deficit to 15, but Kubek responds with a trey. Maryland back up by 18 with just over five minutes left. WBB: The Maryland lead has grown to 20, and it's all but over with seven minutes left barring a miracle. MBB: A Martinelli triple give NU a 32-19 lead at the under 8 timeout. 

The sophomore already has 9 MBB: Barnhizer finds the net for the first time in the game, drilling a wide-open three.

Langborg hits another triple to make it 27-17. MBB: Detroit Mercy hits a three, but Martinelli hits his signature floater to respond.

However, both teams missed the rim badly on their next possession. WBB: END OF THIRD: Maryland 56, Northwestern 39

The Wildcats were outscored 20-6 in the period. They shot 3-of-16 from the field in the quarter. Just unable to string together consistency. MBB: Technical Foul on Detroit Mercy gifts Northwestern two free throws, but Buie splits the pair.

With the extra possession, Martinelli lays it in to make it 19-12 'Cats. MBB: Hunger makes a pair of free throws to make it 16-10 Northwestern.

Buie and Barnhizer still scoreless nearly halfway through the first frame. WBB: Two jumpers from Daley are true to sandwich a Maryland transition bucket. 50-39 Terps, with two minutes left in the third quarter. WBB: Shyanne Sellers has five steals. Northwestern has 17 turnovers, and the third quarter isn't over yet. Not great! WBB: With more than 15 minutes left in the game, Mott picks up her fourth foul on an illegal screen. WBB: Just like that, another Sellers bucket gives UMD a double-digit lead. MBB: It's been all Berry and Langborg, each with five early as NU holds a 12-8 lead. WBB: A three from Alexander and a couple of rough possessions on offense from the 'Cats extend Maryland's lead to 40-33 with 7:35 in the third period. MBB: Still 7-5 NU at the first media timeout. No foul. Kubek checks out. MBB: Mid range jumper from Berry breaks the tie at 7-5 WBB: Allie Kubek was down after getting hit in the face. Officials appear to be reviewing it. MBB: Langborg buries a three on NU's first possession MBB: Nicholson wins the tip and we are underway. WBB: Second half has begun from College Park. Northwestern is in great position to force this one to come down to the wire if it can keep its second-quarter performance up. MBB: Same starters as usual for NU with Buie-Berry-Langborg-Barnhizer-Nicholson on the floor. Northwestern takes the floor for the first time in over a week, and we have everything you need to know before tipoff. HALFTIME: Maryland 36, Northwestern 33

After a slow start offensively, Northwestern got hot. The defense also shined. Weaver has 9 points, with Walsh and Daley contributing 6 points apiece. Casey Harter tying the game with a trey AGAIN! But Sellers answers with one of her own to beat the halftime buzzer. Weaver's free throw is good. The 'Cats are leading on the road. Hailey Weaver with an and-one in transition! She's got eight points, and Northwestern has a chance to take the lead. Paige Mott picks up her third foul, and UMD ends a scoring drought that lasted nearly three minutes with a score from Sellers. Really, really encouraging stretch from NU's defense, though. CASEY HARTER STEPBACK THREE! It's tied at 27 in College Park! Walsh with another bucket, and Lau already has five assists. She's shined as a playmaker thus far. Maryland leads 27-22 with 4:40 in the half to go. It's the same picture. That's three steals for UMD's Shyanne Sellers, but Harter draws a charge in transition. 22-16 Maryland with 7:47 left in the half. Mel Daley makes another midrange jumper. Surely, that sentence has never been repeated before. Northwestern opens the second quarter with a starting five of Pina-Harter-Daley-McWilliams-Ademusayo. The Terps, in contrast, are playing most of their starters with an eight-point lead. END OF FIRST: Maryland 22, Northwestern 14

NU is shooting just 31% from the field, and a couple of runs from the Terps have opened it up. Weaver and Kubek lead all scorers with 6 points through 10 minutes. Maryland really starting to get out in transition. The Terps have already forced Daley to turn it over three times in four minutes of play. It'll end the quarter strong with a swift run. A nice rejection by Caroline Lau, but UMD ends up scoring on the same possession. It's another 6-0 run for Maryland, which leads 16-10. Mel Daley (who's coming off the bench today) trades buckets with Alexander. Still a two-point game in Maryland's favor with under three minutes to play in the first. And on cue, Walsh scores, followed by a Weaver jumper. No. 11 has 6 points already, and it's a 10-8 ballgame. A couple UMD buckets answer some Weaver free throws, and it's -10-4 Maryland.

Caileigh Walsh is 0-of-4 from the field, and NU hasn't scored in over four minutes. A UMD bucket gives the Terps the lead, but both teams are shooting a combined 3-of-13 from the field thus far. Weaver and Allie Kubek trade layups, and we're even at two. Tip is up, and we're underway. Northwestern's starters: 

Caroline Lau
Hailey Weaver
Casey Harter
Caileigh Walsh
Paige Mott

51,"Here come the ‘Cats The Las Vegas Bowl is just hours away. Get acquainted with who’s playing for both sides, plus how to watch and if Northwestern is favored. Today’s injury report for Northwestern. 

Coco Azema, who has been in a walking boot all week, is officially out.

The surprise of the day: QB Brendan Sullivan, who started four games this season, is inactive. Could be a problem for NU if Ben Bryant gets hurt. Yeah. 

This is insane. Northwestern president Michael Schill was greeted with a mix of cheers and boos.

""It has been incredible to watch this team stack up win after win. They have inspired all of us — on campus, and around the world. They inspired us with their tenacy. This is what Wildcats do."" Northwestern AD Derrick Gragg speaking at Northwestern Alumni's pregame tailgate: ""What more can we say about Coach Dave Braun?""

Also thanked fans for staying loyal, and praised the team.

""You're going to see, in a just few hours, what your team is capable of."" The grapes make an appearance in Vegas to close the 2023 season.

First time we're seeing purple-purple-purple since Ireland, which is well over a year ago. Most of our staffers project that the Wildcats will make it five straight bowl game wins by taking down Utah from Allegiant Stadium. Start off gameday right — with all our thoughts on Northwestern sports in the latest mailbag. Per source, Northwestern will start Jordan Knox at LG in the Las Vegas Bowl in place of Josh Priebe, who entered the transfer portal. Immensely clean. Best helmet of the year for NU's biggest game. Braun and Whittingham with the Las Vegas Bowl trophy, which they'll compete for tomorrow night. Braun on coaching NU : ""To pretend that I've wrapped my head around it would be me blowing smoke.

On recruiting and managing the program: ""The way that we move and operate is to ensure we retain those young men."" Gallagher on advice from Blake Gallagher on playing in a bowl: ""He's someone I lean on every week. He watches the game every week, and gives me feedback.

Biggest advice was, ""Business is business. But when it's time to have fun with your teammates and enjoy the city, do that."" Braun on talking to Matt Entz and potentially asking him to join the Northwestern staff: ""I'll keep those conversations private. He'll go outside his comfort zone, and I promise that USC is not inside Matt Entz's comfort zone."" Braun said the ""hardest thing"" to navigate is scholarship numbers.

""I'm here to serve these guys, support these guys. That'll continue.""

Said it's ""okay"" if players decide to leave, either via the NFL or portal. Braun said that Pat Fitzgerald ""did an incredible job"" of allowing younger support staffers to have the chance to grow, and that he wants to sustain that. Braun adds that it's a ""great opportunity to explore."" Said he's in favor of modeling field-to-sideline communication after the NFL. Bryant on how new in-helmet communication affects game flow: ""I think we're pretty excited. We're excited to test that out, and I think it'll improve the game.""

Gallagher adds NU will ""try not to overdo it,"" but that they've used the helmet communication in their practices. Noted Bryant as a prime example of bringing in "" the right person"" in adding players for NU. Braun on balancing recruiting with bowl prep: ""Taking it one hour at a time... We're short-staffed right now, but there's not a single person in our organization that's making excuses..."" Bryant on leading NU in his final year: ""There's so much maturity on this team. I've been so blessed to be around a great group of guys. I'm so happy this team brought me in and welcomed me with open arms."" Braun on the feeling of coaching a bowl game compared to being hired as DC at the beginning of the year: ""It's incredibly special. This opportunity at Northwestern is a dream come true. Has it sunk in? It hasn't. I'm waking up each morning full of gratitude for the opportunity."" Braun on carrying momentum in the postseason: ""I've been so impressed with our team.. I've been so impressed with our practices back in Evanston, but I was most blown away with our Monday practice at Bishop Gorman."" Braun on being named Newcomer Coach of the Year: ""I was not aware, but everything that this team has achieved is a reflection of the character of this group.

""I was asked yesterday how we did this. It's the leadership."" Bryce Gallagher on his favorite part of Vegas: ""The magic show. That was unbelievable, getting to spend time with my teammates and see some of the magic that Matt Franco was able to put on was an incredible experience."" Braun calls Utah an ""incredibly formidable opponent.""

Emphasizes that he views Utah as a model of a program that's built off of ""team football, physicality and fundamentals."" Braun said those extra three weeks together and the extra game was an added motivation through the final weeks of the season. Braun: ""This is an incredible opportunity. It starts with the opportunity that we've gotten to have additional weeks of practice, with a special group of young men.

""An opportunity to continue a season with an incredible group of people. You couldn't ask for anything more."" Northwestern side speaking now.

David Braun in his openining statement: ""This has been an incredible experience for our staff, our families. Unbelievable week so far.

""Something we'll remember for a long, long time."" Whittingham on what's stood out about Northwestern: ""Toughness. Offensive line's impressive. It all starts up front. Good quarterback, receiver that's caught a lot of balls...

Said he sees a ""lot of similar traits between the two programs."" Whittingham on whether Northwestern's 2018 Holiday Bowl win adds motivation: ""I don't think there's extra motivation. That was so many years ago, no one on this roster was involved."" Kyle Whittingham in his opening statement: ""No strangers to the Vegas Bowl. Excited to have the opportunity to play a great Northwestern team.

Added that ""both teams faced a lot of adversity this year in their own way."" Kicking off coverage here from Allegiant Stadium! Ben Bryant, Bryce Gallagher and David Braun set to speak to the media. Pound the Talk episodes from on the road are simply the best. To take down Utah, Northwestern should need to stick to its familiar keys: A bowl rematch with the Utes brings new questions.  offers some more insight on Utah, and what Northwestern can expect tomorrow night: A double-digit comeback win means it’s time for a more macro look at the Wildcats. Here are three takeaways from Northwestern women’s basketball’s latest victory: Viva Las Vegas Northwestern’s rebounding success was not only a big reason why it prevailed over Arizona State, but also a sign in the right direction. That, and more from the Wildcats’ impressive night in Phoenix: Get acquainted with the 15 latest Wildcats. Northwestern secured its second straight victory against Temple, thanks to second-half heroics from Melannie Daley. FINAL: Northwestern 72, Temple 68

The 'Cats seemed outplayed at first but headlined by Melannie Daley, they were unstoppable in the second half. 70-66 with just eight seconds left and Temple has two free throws. 'Cats up 68-61 with 30 seconds left. At this point, if Melannie Daley is going to shoot just let her. The Wildcats are up 64-54 with 04:27 left. Daley has scored 10 points this quarter and 14 straight NU points. Melannie Daley is putting on a show. That is all. Daley just scored another six points, making for 10 straight points. Put the team on your back Melannie Daley. Two free throws and a layup in 35 seconds make it 49-45 headed into the last quarter. Back even at 45. NU had its biggest lead of the day at 42-37. Tied back at 14 through four minutes in the third. And just like that, Northwestern is ahead 32-30 off baskets from Walsh, Mott and Daley. In the final minutes, three baskets brought the 'Cats to 30-26 headed into the half. NU is keeping this one close. Lau gets the rebound and sprints down court to make it 28-21. Walsh breaks through the nearly five-minute drought to make it 28-19. 28-17 with five minutes left in the second quarter. Paige Mott has scored the 'Cats' lone basket. With four seconds left a three gives Temple a 18-15 lead headed into the second quarter. Fueled by a 7-point out of a timeout, the 'Cats eventually evened the score at 15 with a minute left. Temple leads Northwestern 13-5. The teams were trading basket, but the Owls are currently riding an 11-point run. Northwestern women's basketball will look for two straight wins before the holiday break this morning. Follow along for updates. The Wildcats looked more like the Phoenix Suns in the Footprint Center, crushing Arizona State. FINAL: Northwestern 65, Arizona State 46

The Wildcats stood on business out in Phoenix, throttling the Sun Devils. Boo Buie led NU with 22 points, while Ty Berry collected a double-double.

The Sun Devils shot just 31% from the floor in the Footprint Center. Ty Berry has his first double-double since last year at Indiana with 12 points and 10 rebounds! With just 3:04 left, Northwestern is coasting 61-42. The 'Cats haven't been trailing since it was 2-0 Sun Devils. Flat out dominant showing. Buie goes iso and makes a floater to get to 20 points. The most amazing thing is that he never felt fully dominant. Have to say, appreciate the ""U of A"" chants whenever Arizona State is at the line. Barnhizer breaks the ice in the second half via a free throw. He's up to 14 now. Chris Collins calls timeout, but Northwestern is still boatracing Arizona State 56-39. To be fair, the Sun Devils are outscoring the Wildcats 26-20 in the second half, but there's just 7:19 left. Martinelli's had a quietly good night for NU. Six points, three rebounds and two assists off the bench. Martinelli lays it in, and the lead has ballooned back to 21 for Northwestern. Buie now has four threes! Up to 14 points on the night. Jose Perez has hit four free throws, but it's still a 44-28 lead for the 'Cats with 12:12 to go. Collins makes a layup over a defender, but Langborg answers right away with a three. Those are his first points of the night. Miller makes two free throws, and Arizona State has cut the lead to inside of 20. The 'Cats have just five points in this whole second half, and Barnhizer hasn't scored yet. But so far, it hasn't been of consequence. We have reached College Football playoff discourse territory because this game is so lopsided. Brooks Barnhizer, Boo Buie and Ty Berry is what we thought this trio would be  Barnhizer can't get the shot off, and it's the under-16. Northwestern hanging on to a 20-point lead with a 41-21 advantage. Akil Watson fights through contact to draw an and-one, making the free throw. Buie making it rain in Phoenix! He hits his third three of the evening, and it's still a 23-point lead. Berry hits Nicholson, who uses a fake and then lays it in off the glass. Miller converts a corner three to get the scoring started in the final 20. HALF: Northwestern 36, Arizona State 13

Yeah, you read that right. An unreal showing on both sides in the first 20 minutes for NU.

Brooks Barnhizer has 13, while Ty Berry has added nine of his own. The 'Cats force an ASU turnover, and Barnhizer makes a second-chance layup. That ends an unreal first half. Miller makes one of two. Miller will shoot two after a foul on Berry. Good defense from Barnhizer to force a jump ball. Pretty much everything swaying purple. Barnhizer works a flurry of moves and then drills a falling jumper. It's a 22-point game. Buie drops it off to Hunger, who's good. 32-12 Wildcats. Buie splashes a deep straightaway three, and Northwestern leads ASU by 18. We've hit the under-8, and Northwestern leads Arizona State 27-12.

The 'Cats are shooting 50% and have seen big contributions from Brooks Barnhizer and Ty Berry. Luke Hunger has also been impactful with Matt Nicholson/Blake Preston in foul trouble. Hunger snares the miss from Berry and lays it in. He's playing at a high level right now. Selebangue makes a layup, which is just the fifth FG for ASU. The first half is 75% over. Barnhizer gets the steal and feeds Berry, who hits another trey! The Wildcats have their biggest lead of the night at 15, and No. 3 has nine. Barnhizer swishes a crossover elbow jumper, and he's got nine points already. A good dish from Langborg hits Hunger, who makes the layup. Bryant Selebangue draws contact on Luke Hunger but misses both free throws. The two sides are 1-for-7 from the line (!!) Langborg throws it right to the ASU bench, and he now has two turnovers. The 'Cats are up to five, but still lead 18-10. Nicholson bumps Collins, and now he too has two fouls. Brycen Jong drills a corner three for ASU following the pause, and Blake Preston has already committed his second foul. Berry splashes a three, and ASU is forced to call timeout. The Wildcats lead by 11 and have made their last four shots. Neal sinks a three, but Nick Martinelli answers with an impressive fake and bank shot. Barnhizer attacks, spins and makes a tough shot. Northwestern now leads by nine with 11:30 to go in the first half. Buie breaks the scoring lull with a friendly roll. 'Cats up 11-4. Is the roof open in Phoenix?? Neither side has made open looks, or much of anything. Collins misses from the line, and Buie gets on the board via a high-glass layup. 8-4 Northwestern. A bad pass from Langborg allows Frankie Collins to lay it in, plus the foul. Northwestern's defense has been terrific so far, forcing two steals and holding ASU to 1-for-6 from the field. Collins and Langborg trade open threes, and that takes us to the under-16. It's 6-2 Northwestern.

The two teams are shooting 3-for-12 so far. Berry's fading jumper is cash after the Nicholson miss, so NU leads by four. Nicholson misses both, and I am yet again asking how Northwestern is this bad at making free throws. Ty Berry hits one free throw, and Nicholson draws contact after a good feed by Langborg. Still 4-2 'Cats. Jamiya Neal converts a layup for ASU, but Barnhizer hits a corner three to get the 'Cats on the board. 3-2 NU. The two teams are a combined 0-for-6 so far in the first 90 seconds. Nicholson wins the tip, and we're off. Northwestern trotting out its usual starting five in Phoenix with Boo Buie, Ty Berry, Ryan Langborg, Brooks Barnhizer and Matthew Nicholson.

The Sun Devils will start former Illini Adam Miller for the second straight game. The ‘Cats will look for a critical non-con win on national TV. That wraps up Braun's presser. We'll hear from him next on Friday from Vegas. Braun said NU will no longer have a director of player personnel.

In terms of desirable traits, he wants ""what it understands to scout and evaluate and project a young man — not who he is, but who he can be. I'm looking for guys that have some experience at lower levels."" Was also grateful for the efforts of Johnny Kovach, Bryan Payton and Lauren McCree. Braun on filling recruiting staff openings: ""We have this opportunity to really zoom out. How is the landscape really operating in college football?""

Said there will be ""restructuring.""

""We're gonna rethink it a little bit.""

Also praised the departing Todd McShane. More: ""We're not concerned with what other people think. We fully trust our process."" Braun on this class: ""I think it totally aligns with [being a developmental program].""
