Share this story Editor’s note: On Saturday afternoon The Daily Northwestern published a report in which an anonymous player claimed this hazing consisted of unwanted sexual and emotional abuse. Hours later per ESPN’s Adam Rittenberg the Northwestern football team responded to those claims with a statement that can be found here. It keeps getting worse for Northwestern football. In a report produced by ArentFox Schiff lawyer Maggie Hickey credible accusations of hazing were found inside the ‘Cats’ program. While the investigation was unable to identify specific players or coaches who were involved in the hazing there was widespread knowledge of hazing between players. The investigation concluded that the coaches were unaware of the incidents; however head coach Pat Fitzgerald has been suspended for two weeks without pay effective immediately and other restrictions have been imposed on the program. “Hazing in any form is unacceptable and goes against our core values at Northwestern where we strive to make the University a safe and welcoming environment for all of our students” Northwestern’s President Michael Schill said in a statement. “Our athletics programs are held to the highest standards and in this case we failed to meet them. I expect that today’s actions will prevent this from ever happening again.” In an executive summary of the investigation released by Northwestern Hickey found that incidents occurred in the locker room or at “Camp Kenosha” where the Wildcats used to hold their training camp. While the investigation did not find sufficient evidence to reveal coaches were aware of the hazing Hickey found that “there had been significant opportunities to discover and report the hazing conduct.” As a result of the investigation NU will now require an individual not affiliated with the football team to monitor the locker room. In addition the Wildcats will permanently discontinue “Camp Kenosha.” “I was very disappointed when I heard about the allegations of hazing on our football team”  Fitzgerald said in a statement. “Northwestern football prides itself on producing not just athletes but fine young men with character befitting the program and our University. We hold our student-athletes and our program to the highest standards; we will continue to work to exceed those standards moving forward.” This is not the first time Northwestern Athletics has had a hazing scandal. In 2006 NU’s women’s soccer team was suspended due to hazing. “Northwestern Athletics prides itself on providing a world-class student-athlete experience which includes a safe and respectful environment for all of our students coaches and staff” Northwestern Athletic Director Dr. Derrick Gragg said in a statement. “We respect the courage of the individuals who came forward to make us aware of the issue and we vow to do our part to create a more positive environment moving forward.” Inside NU will continue to update the story as more details become available. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story The Bears haven’t won a playoff game in over a decade. The Bulls aren’t much more impressive winning their last playoff series in 2015. And aside from the glory of the 2016 Cubs Chicago’s baseball teams haven’t been worth a ticket purchase for the better part of the 21st century. Why be satisfied with — at best — mediocrity? Why not try for something better — at least something more entertaining? But to its credit the City of Chicago is trying to satiate these desires. Look no further than the NASCAR Cup Series which came to Grant Park last week. The traveling circuit of races selected Chi-Town as its next destination in hopes of attracting a younger demographic which might be more inclined to watch street racing as opposed to the traditional format that sees drivers race around a roughly half-mile track hundreds of times. The spectacle received a warm reaction on television as the race’s 4.795 million network viewers marked the second-largest audience of any NASCAR Cup Series since the Daytona 500 earlier this year. But even more promising for the city itself people turned out in swarms to watch the stock cars zoom around the familiar streets. While the race was cut short due to flooding on certain parts of the track Chicagoans proved their readiness to back any sort of sports — so long as it’s entertaining. For a city storied with tales of ninth-inning home runs game-winning baskets and go-ahead touchdowns something new might be good for the sports scene in the city. Today I’ll take a quick dive into a few other professional sports leagues whose descendance into Chicago would ignite fiery fans around the metropolitan area.  Major League Eating Perhaps I’m blinded by a bit of recency bias but Joey Chestnut and Chicago sound like a match made in heaven. Make the city the hub for the deep dish pizza slice contest seeing who can down the most Lou Malnati’s pies in 30 minutes. Most of the eating competitions are shorter under 10 or 15 minutes but deep dish takes time. Right now Chestnut downs hotdogs so easily that you hardly even know he’s stuffing his stomach with enough sodium to kill a wolf. Give fans their money’s worth and have them sit up there for longer; see the struggle and contemplation in their eyes. No doubt Chicagoans would give contestants the cheers they need to keep eating. And the beauty of professional eating… You don’t need to be 6-foot-6 more than 220 pounds or train six hours a day. As such upon buying their tickets fans should be able to opt-in to the Fan Fare Seat raffle in which the announcer calls out one onlooker to compete on-stage alongside the rest of the field a few minutes before showtime. Talk about making the sport accessible. Ironman For the uninitiated an Ironman is a triathlon consisting of a 2.4-mile swim a 112-mile bike ride and a 26.2-mile run. I’d venture to say it’s the most difficult feat of athleticism that exists on a professional level today and there’s no reason that the sport couldn’t host one of its qualifiers for the Ironman World Championships in Chicago. Individual sports are a great thing to bring into the mix for Chicagoans who are used to rooting for six- nine- or 11-player squads. Undoubtedly among the athletes Chicago has to offer hometown heroes would frequent the waves trails and roads. Imagine the chaos of dozens of uber-elite athletes plunging into Lake Michigan for a multi-mile swim in June or July. On Ironman’s end racing in the confines of a big city would do numbers for its television ratings which currently are inhibited by the courses utilizing uninspiring duplicative tracks. Major League Rugby Okay this is a bit of a cheat on my end given that Chicago already has a Major League Rugby team the Hounds. But it’d be wrong of me to not include this league when it literally is hosting its championship game at SeatGeek Stadium today. You’d think that an event full of hard-hitting action and music provided by DJ Diesel (Shaquile O’Neal) wouldn’t need so much promotion but I haven’t heard a thing about it. I won’t lead you on. The Hounds finished their 2023 campaign with a 3-13 record but if you’re a Chicagoan already used to uninspiring sports teams you may as well watch one that features 300-pound men slamming into one another at full force. Rugby’s a sport that’s like football but with a more raucous atmosphere — perfect for Bears fans who were tamed by Mitch Trubisky. Game tickets would be affordable and the objectives and rules are easy to follow. Make it happen. Go to a Hounds game next year. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story A two-week suspension for a head coach is an appalling unacceptable punishment for someone whose team was allegedly involved in sexual hazing. Pat Fitzgerald is accountable for his locker room and even if he was unaware then that’s a reason proving he is unfit to lead young men.  ""Northwestern hired Maggie Hickey of ArentFox Schiff to lead an investigation looking into an anonymous hazing complaint received in late November 2022. On Friday an executive summary reported that “the complainants claims were largely supported by the evidence gathered during the investigation” and while specific coaches and players were not identified the investigation supported that “there had been significant opportunities to discover and report the hazing conduct.” The consequences for Northwestern: a two week-unpaid suspension for Fitzgerald the discontinuation of “Camp Kenosha” where training camp is often held a non-Northwestern-affiliated official to monitor the locker room and some training into anti-hazing. "" This vagueness of this report and the quite honestly extremely bleak punishment for Northwestern’s highest-paid employee just seemed like an attempt to handle an inconvenient scandal and move on. That would have been the case but on Saturday came an article from The Daily Northwestern where a former player revealed claims of coerced sexual acts and a second player corroborated these assertions.  The anonymous whistleblower recounted numerous instances of abhorrent physical activities that seem to have become a tradition in the program namely the hazing act of “running” for players when they messed up. The Daily reported it involved being “restrained by a group of 8-10 upperclassmen dressed in various ‘purge-like’ masks who would then begin ‘dry-humping’ the victim in the dark locker room.” Additional hazing included forcing players to strip and then spraying them with a hose or into various physical activities that often involved interaction like practicing snaps or running into each other.  “It’s done under this smoke and mirror of ‘oh this is team bonding’ but no this is sexual abuse” the player told The Daily.  Since this article came out a statement from Northwestern football countered these claims and showed support for Fitzgerald; however it is unclear who “the ENTIRE Northwestern Football Team” actually is.  Statement from Northwestern’s entire team pushing back against the allegations of hazing which they call “exaggerated and twisted.” They also say coach Pat Fitzgerald had no knowledge or involvement in the allegations. pic.twitter.com/lMOAgCe0EB It’s also worth noting that The Daily had photo and video evidence as well as testimonies from two players and the report stated that “participation in or knowledge of the hazing activities was widespread across football players.” Nonetheless the report and the way it was handled says a lot about the school and its athletics.  No university is in a position to treat sexual misconduct and hazing lightly but let it be reminded that Northwestern specifically has a shameless reputation in this arena.  In 2021 Mike Polisky was promoted to athletic director. This came after a series of scandals including being named in a sexual harassment lawsuit by a Wildcat cheerleader. Amid backlash he resigned nine days after assuming the role.  Mike Polisky one of four candidates for the Northwestern AD job (according to @sryantribune) is one of four people cited in the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against the school by Northwestern cheerleader Hayden Richardson. pic.twitter.com/RncEAYhAYa Also recall that Northwestern faces a prominent Abolish Greek Life movement in light of numerous sexual assault and rape cases that garnered national news coverage. Are these two things the same? No. But the commitment to cure the issue at hand is. Whether in the corridors of an old fraternity house or in the exclusivity of state-of-the-art athletic facilities sexual assault is a grave matter that demands the strictest punishment and deserves to be evaluated with extreme care.  There’s a reason this story is being covered by ESPN USA Today the Chicago Tribune and countless other outlets. There’s a reason President Michael Schill felt prompted to send out an email late Saturday night admitting he “may have erred in weighing the appropriate sanctions for Coach Fitzgerald.” It’s because two weeks of unpaid work is egregious as sufficient punishment. This suspension also comes during an NCAA dead period where Fitzgerald can’t even contact recruits and there are no practices. All this does is leave a man on a 10-year $57 million contract without pay for 14 days.  This so-called punishment is no punishment at all for the alleged humiliating and degrading hazing happening under his watch. It’s disappointing for these players for their families and for the student body that it takes a public outcry — from the biggest papers in the country covering a story broken by student journalists— to cause these terms to be re-evaluated.  NEW: Northwestern President Michael Schill writes about Pat Fitzgerald\s suspension ""I focused too much on what the report concluded he didn\t know and not enough on what he should\ve known"" in an email.Added he would assess with NU leadership to decide the next steps. pic.twitter.com/aIYUNp6cYP To be fair this story and what happened is far from being fully recognized. Fitzgerald is receiving support from current and former players and has also expressed his disappointment and unawareness of the hazing presented in ArentFox Schiff’s findings on Friday. Yet two players told The Daily that they had seen Fitzgerald make “the Shrek clap” —the signal for a player to be run — during practices and the investigation did highlight “significant opportunities” where hazing would have been made clear.  But it shouldn’t matter whether or not he knew. It matters if it happened. That’s the bottom line. Fitzgerald is at the helm of Wildcat football and has been for 17 seasons. He is responsible for his team and should have complete control and knowledge of his locker room. After nearly two decades there should be no exception. There is no room for lenient disciplinary measures and there is no room for a second chance when you are in that high of a role and have over 100 college students under you. Northwestern is in no position to treat sexual misconduct as “a slap on the wrist” which is how the whistleblower characterized these sanctions to The Daily. But it is just as fair to ask why there is a division on this football team and why anything akin to hazing or sexual assault could ever come to be. Even more what has this university learned from its past and what is its commitment to actually facilitating a culture safe for students and athletes? Right now Northwestern seems like an institution concerned with public perception rather than asking itself what is ethical at the moment. Similar to Polisky the university is being questioned after a decision was made and then amending to what others deem as right.  Northwestern is scheduled to play its first game on Sept. 3. That’s awfully quick for a team fighting incredibly serious disturbing allegations and now advocating a contradictory narrative only after a more detailed article was written. But this is bigger than football.  Northwestern has to learn to act ethically and adequately — the first time. If these reported incidents of sexual harassment and emotional turmoil are true then there should be no instance where this football team’s season is uninterrupted and normal.     \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story On Monday afternoon a report broke that nine members of Northwestern baseball — both players and staff — shared with 670 The Score that head coach Jim Foster allegedly instituted an environment in 2023 that was toxic and “broke the spirit of the team.” The university conducted an investigation regarding this behavior; however the administration allegedly did not speak to Northwestern baseball players during that process. An official HR report was filed in November 2022 and concluded in February of 2023. Shortly after two assistant coaches stepped down as well as the program’s director of operations. In addition these members confirmed that Athletic Director Derrick Gragg conducted a “chaotic and unusual hiring process” in tabbing Foster as head coach in June 2022. He and Deputy Director of Athletics Monique Holland supposedly “pawned the hire off” to two Northwestern boosters who sat in on final interviews.  Those boosters who played for former head coach Ron Wellman said that hiring a “disciplinarian” (as the report noted) like Foster who coached at Army before coming to Evanston would help the players overachieve. According to the nine members who spoke with 670 The Score this was anything but the case. Not only did the team go 10-40 during the 2023 season but pitching coach Jon Strauss director of operations Chris Beacom and hitting and recruiting coordinator Dusty Napoleon left the team as of Feb. 27 according to Kendall Rogers of D1Baseball. Off the diamond the report noted there was much more wrong with the program. The report suggested that university HR investigation found Foster guilty of making inappropriate comments to a female staffer as well as bullying and making derogatory comments. Further the report shared that Foster had made racist remarks and encouraged players not to seek treatment for injury. According to the report one player was forced to engage in a “punishment run” which lasted for the “vast majority of a 2.5-hour practice.” This occurred in spite of a Rhode Island player dying under Foster’s watch allegedly for a “punishment run.” Moreover the report posited that 15 players transferred due solely because of Foster. When Foster left Army last summer there was allegedly a “celebratory Zoom” and the school was “thrilled” to remove him. In February when asked why Foster would not be fired Holland allegedly told trainer Joshua Kuester that “sometimes the right thing to do is not always the best thing to do.” This comes in the wake of numerous sexual hazing and racism allegations surrounding Northwestern football over the last few days.

Share this story Following two former Northwestern players alleging details of coerced sexual hazing in The Daily Northwestern and to ESPN another has come forward to confirm that such activities did occur. A recent former Wildcat — who requested anonymity — said that the reports shared in prior articles are “100% true.” “All those things happened” the player said. This player shared that while he never witnessed any incidents of “running” in which players are “restrained by a group of 8-10 upperclassmen dressed in various ‘Purge-like’ masks who would then begin ‘dry-humping’ the victim in a dark locker room” he has heard players “laugh about it.” The player also revealed that he saw “Shrek’s List” naked bear crawls and other activities occur. Moreover the player said that players engaged in “rap battles” in which players would “encourage you to say gay homosexual things.” According to the player these “rap battles” occurred in the locker room or other private spaces “where there’s no coaches around.” In accordance with prior reporting the player confirmed he saw a whiteboard in the team’s locker room that referenced “running.” Further the player affirmed that Pat Fitzgerald did the “Shrek clap” which was a “slow clap over your head.” “That used to happen all the time” the player said adding that he was unsure if Fitzgerald used it to signify players selected for “running.” Regarding the scale of the hazing the player referred to it as “widespread” noting it was not just based on position groups. Additionally the player feels that the hazing has been a long-standing problem at Northwestern. “They all say it’s been happening before” the player said. “It’s been happening before just this year.” The player said he’s “sure” that Fitzgerald was aware of the behaviors that occurred but that “nobody in the program” brought it to him as a “problem.” He added that “the assistant coaches and everybody else knew” emphasizing that particularly those who had been at Northwestern longer “definitely know about it.” As for why nobody intervened to stop hazing behaviors the player suggested that teammates may have been “enjoying” the activities and that such practices were how they “had fun.” “That’s how they would bond” the player said. “They’re all in there laughing and stuff. They could be affected but they’re in there laughing.” The player posited that he never saw anybody become distraught because of hazing but some “kids would resist it.” In part the lack of visible tangible harm is why he thinks nothing was shut down. “If a kid would have came up to [Fitzgerald] at the time and felt like they really had been violated he may have addressed it” the player said. The player shared that he was contacted by the university’s investigation team in December which was led by Maggie Hickey of ArentFox Schiff. In Northwestern’s executive summary the school reported that “there had been significant opportunities to discover and report the hazing conduct” but that there was not sufficient evidence “to believe that coaching staff knew about the ongoing hazing conduct.” The player suggested that if Fitzgerald did know about hazing he should face a “swift punishment.” “Not saying he should get fired but it should be more than just two weeks in July” the player said. “At the end of the day you’re responsible for these people when it comes to your program.” While a myriad of current and former Wildcats expressed support for Fitzgerald and his character the player chose not to share any reactions to the emerging situation on social media citing his own privacy. The player said that Fitzgerald is “well-liked throughout the program” but that his perception or character doesn’t mean he was not cognizant of hazing. “He could be a nice guy and still knew that this stuff was going on” the player said. “Two things could be true.” As for next steps the player said he wants the university to send a “message” that such hazing behaviors involving coercive sexual acts and physical and mental harassment cannot occur. “I do think that stuff in the program whether it’s consensual or not needs to stop” the player said. “That shouldn’t be happening at all in a football environment.” \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Reflecting on the last 72 hours or so cacophony is the word that first comes to mind. These last three days have been as loud as any in the history of Northwestern Athletics. The Daily Northwestern’s release of a report on Saturday — in which a former football player detailed sexually abusive hazing practices within the program — rang out. The emergence of a report read on 670 The Score on Monday afternoon which detailed baseball head coach Jim Foster’s alleged institution of a toxic environment pierced through the football discourse. And Pat Fitzgerald’s firing that night was the gale that blew the house down. Yet among all that noise from so many corners of the Northwestern community it’s been the silence of one man near the center of it all that has been deafening: that of Athletic Director Derrick Gragg. Whether that falls on him or the university for advising him to remain silent that is inexcusable for the leader of a department in crisis. Since Friday when Northwestern released its initial two-week unpaid suspension for Fitzgerald Gragg has not shared any statement publicly. While the Northwestern community has received statements from University President Michael Schill regarding Fitzgerald’s initial suspension on Friday the release of new hazing details on Saturday and Fitzgerald’s firing on Monday Gragg has not even publicly acknowledged any of those situations yet. In fact according to ESPN’s Adam Rittenberg he didn’t even return to Northwestern’s campus until Tuesday morning. In four days there hasn’t been a statement nor a press conference nor a letter from Gragg. Nothing. Some of the information released has mentioned Gragg’s name explicitly. Nine members of the baseball program alleged on Monday that the AD “conducted a chaotic and unusual hiring process” in hiring Foster to lead the baseball program in June 2022. The members specifically noted that Gragg and Deputy Director of Athletics Monique Holland “pawned the hire off” to two boosters who sat in on the final interviews for Foster. Inside NU contacted the university requesting a comment from Gragg on the baseball and football allegations mentioned above but received no response. It’s of the utmost importance to first consider that the delicateness of the entire situation. Although unconfirmed this creates the possibility that Gragg may be remaining quiet due to the guidance of a legal counsel or higher-ups at Northwestern. At face value it’s a valid reason to not to publicly comment. However especially with Schill having already made three public remarks as of Tuesday afternoon this rationale would be problematic. This doesn’t just potentially convey a message that Gragg prioritizes his legal protection over repairing the athletic department he is responsible for. It could also hint that Gragg’s authority isn’t as strong as his position title indicates. The clear alternative that the public could have — and may have — already perceived whether correctly or incorrectly is that Gragg is waiting for the situation’s intensity to decrease even as more fuel is added to the fire by the hour. It is also clear that Northwestern’s athletic department is in as precarious a public position as it has ever faced and it is in desperate need of a strong leader. Regardless of which of the cases above apply to Gragg he has not shown he is capable of leading the athletic department through this disaster as it continues to spiral further out of his control. He has either failed to fulfill his role or Northwestern’s current chain of command is mortally flawed. Either way if Gragg can’t speak on behalf of the athletic department he shouldn’t manage it. He either needs to step down or Northwestern has to take a step toward rebuilding its athletic department by removing him. Diving into Gragg’s alleged actions handing off a final interview for a public-facing employee as important as Foster to boosters who already favored the former Army head coach is beyond irresponsible; it cheats out other deserving candidates. There were surely applicants who deserved the position more than a coach who ended up going 10-40. Given that nine members of the baseball program corroborated this account that report is very concerning for someone who oversees 19 different teams. Perhaps most importantly though it puts Northwestern student-athletes in grave emotional danger — and baseball players suffered from Gragg’s negligence in the hiring process. A person close to the program shared with Inside NU’s Gavin Dorsey that as a result of the environment Foster created the players’ mental health suffered so badly that half of the team reportedly had to go to therapy. That doesn’t include the detail that Foster allegedly discouraged players from seeking treatment for physical injuries. While that falls on Foster Gragg is also at fault for failing to adequately vet him in the hiring process and identify red flags that were found in Northwestern HR’s report such as its confirmation that 15 of Foster’s former players transferred solely because of him. In his inaugural statement when he took Northwestern’s AD job Gragg said: “My career has been shaped by an unwavering belief in the potential of student-athletes to excel in all areas.” Reflect on those paragraphs above and think about whether Gragg has done that. Think about the emotional health of Northwestern football players right now. They’re dealing with the loss of a head coach who wasn’t just the face of their program but was a man who many of them looked up to outside of football — as numerous current Wildcats shared on Twitter. According to multiple football players Gragg — who was not on campus — shared the news of Fitzgerald’s firing with the team via Zoom. An anonymous player told WildcatReport’s Matthew Shelton that Gragg only appeared in the Zoom meeting — which reportedly lasted for 30 minutes — for five minutes with his camera off. Tight end Charlie Mangieri even said on Twitter that Gragg didn’t even leave time for the players to ask questions. Fellow tight end Marshall Lang also said that the meeting left the team “incredibly frustrated” that the administration was sharing the news with the team. In a tweet that received over 300 likes he criticized Gragg and Schill for not “even hav[ing] the balls to show up in person to tell the team.” Regardless of where anyone sides on the debate as to whether Fitzgerald should or should not have been fired yesterday there’s one thing everyone should agree on: the emotional and mental well-being of the student-athletes needs to be a primary concern for the athletic department right now. The players needed Gragg to display transparency and visible care and he failed miserably. Rittenberg did report on Tuesday afternoon that Gragg has met with the football staff and will later meet with the players but first impressions matter immensely when addressing a crisis as delicate as this one. To not offer the players — and the greater NU community — any semblance of immediate transparency is detrimental to Northwestern Athletics both inside and outside of its buildings. Gragg’s decision to retain Northwestern’s assistant coaches and support staff for the 2023 season on Tuesday afternoon also brings its fair share of controversy. While not doing so could have put Northwestern in grave danger of not fielding a team in 2023 putting millions of dollars in revenue at risk it also allows for the same issues that have plagued the football program to fester. Like Fitzgerald these staffers are also partially responsible for allowing hazing to persist; at least some of these members showed negligence during the 2022 season. A recent former player confirmed this information to Inside NU’s Bradley Locker on Monday. The ArentFox Schiff investigation determined that these coaches may not have known about the hazing that went on but had opportunities to discover and report it. Gragg’s decision to keep them this quickly demonstrates that he hasn’t done sufficient vetting to prove their innocence. Again Gragg may not be completely at fault for all of these actions. But even if he isn’t the university is and it underscores the failure of its athletic administrative structure to protect the student-athletes and the community it serves with Gragg at the head.

Share this story Following the 2020 season Pat Fitzgerald had just led his team to a Big Ten West title a Citrus Bowl victory and NU’s first top 10 ranking in the Associated Press poll since he played for the Wildcats in 1996. After the season Fitz was rewarded with a 10-year eight-figure contract by the university. In that moment it appeared clear: Fitzgerald was invincible at the helm of the program. It did not matter what the record on the field was Fitz’s seat never even reached lukewarm; now less than three years into his new deal the longtime face of Northwestern has been fired and he has no one to blame but himself. It is a stunning fall from grace for Fitzgerald who was revered as one of the best coaches in college football for many years. He took what was a historically bad program excluding the few years he played for the ‘Cats and made it prominent on a national scale. He is the all-time winningest coach in NU history and his 10 bowl appearances are the most of any regime. For a school with notoriously tough admission standards a lack of student interest and a history of poor play Fitzgerald found ways to win. It was his triumphs through the adversity that made NFL teams interested in tapping him to run their organizations: the Green Bay Packers New York Jets and Chicago Bears all contacted Fitz during their head coaching searches. Fitz was at the height of the entire sport; but now his legacy will always have huge asterisks next to it because of the culture he fostered inside Northwestern football. Back in January I said in a piece that “If Northwestern wants to return to being a competitive Big Ten team it is time to stop being stubborn and modernize.” At that time I was talking about the archaic version of football that Northwestern trotted out onto the field every week. However it is the exact same stubbornness and living in the past that cost Fitzgerald his job early Monday evening. Fitz prided himself on being an “old-school” mentality type of coach and he seemed to fail to keep up with the modernization of society. This is the same man who blamed cell phones for lack of attendance at games called the RPO communism and has refused to use NIL money to attract high school recruits to Evanston. It seems his refusal to modernize carried over to what was going on inside the culture of the program as well.  As reported by The Daily Northwestern and confirmed by Inside NU’s Bradley Locker multiple allegations of sexual hazing were occurring inside Northwestern’s locker room.  Multiple reports have confirmed the “running” of players where upperclassmen restrained a player and dry humped him. Furthermore Locker reported that the “car wash” a hazing event where players would be forced to rub up against naked players to enter the showers had occurred even when 2007 graduates were playing. It is hard to believe that if it was happening in 2007 and still happening in 2022 as the whistleblower alleged that Fitzgerald had zero clue of this annual incident for 15 years. In fact I am wondering if Fitz may have participated in this type of action as a player in the mid-1990s.  While hazing like what has been alleged might have been more acceptable in the ‘90s there is zero tolerance for any mistreatment of players today and Fitzgerald knew that. When investigator Maggie Hickey found that “there had been significant opportunities to discover and report the hazing conduct” it showed that everyone in the program knew yet she could not prove it. Plausible deniability was the name of the game. Fitzgerald seemed to believe that as long as no one could prove he had direct knowledge of the hazing then he would be in the clear and the treatment could continue and to be fair he was absolutely correct.  Northwestern knew 11 players came forward and alleged that sexual hazing occurred inside NU football but all they gave love tap on the wrist. Originally Fitzgerald received a two-week unpaid suspension; however the suspension was right in the middle of an NCAA dead period. The ‘Cats could not contact recruits host visits or hold practices. Summed up Fitzgerald’s two-week paid vacation became a two-week unpaid vacation and for someone whose contract was reportedly closing in on $6 million a year it’s not like NU put a dent in their former head coach’s wallet.  On Friday morning NU sent a clear message: Fitzgerald was more important than any wrongdoing in the program he oversaw and if it wasn’t for the work of tremendous student journalism Northwestern would have swept this whole thing under the rug and moved right along. This same level of leeway allowed Fitz to go 4-20 over the last two seasons and not have to even think about his job security. If any other program went 1-11 and had not won a game on American soil the head coach would have been handed a pink slip and told to pack their office but not Fitzgerald. Not only was Northwestern hamstrung by his massive buyout but no one could even imagine a Northwestern without Pat Fitzgerald. It is because of this that he was allowed to send out his outdated offense onto the field every Saturday even though the game had evolved into spread offenses that put pressure on the defense and score points. No one questioned him when he hired friends into prominent positions even though everyone could see they were not a good fit for what the program needed. Even after the last two horrid seasons athletic director Derrick Gragg was way more restrained in his criticisms of Fitzgerald than he was of Chris Collins because at the end of the day Gragg appeared to answer to Fitzgerald. The only man who appeared to have any say in what Fitz did was Pat Ryan.  Fitz was the face of Northwestern and he knew it. He had created a cult of personality that attracted casual Northwestern students and alumni to become diehard ‘Cats fans. He preached culture and the “Wildcat Way” a style of play that launched Northwestern into its most successful era in program history; however after reheat has been learned over the last  96 hours we have to ask what the culture was inside NU football. Fitz proudly said to us last season that despite being 1-11 the culture of the program was still there. We now know that the culture of the program had a giant black eye on it and whether he knew everything or not it happened under his watch. He believed his overwhelming support from fans alumni and players would make it impossible for the university to implement any actionable consequences but no matter what the University only will look after itself in the long run no matter how important the individual is. This pains me to write. Like many I looked up to Fitzgerald. As someone who loves coaching Fitzgerald represented everything I wanted to be in a coach and his message of culture with the victories that came with it made me believe that culture was the key to success. Fitz was so intertwined into the fabric of Northwestern that I never thought this day would come and definitely not for a hazing scandal. However his own stubbornness to evolve — both on the sidelines and off of them — cost him his job. He had the possibility to move Northwestern forward both on and off the field; instead he has now set the program back.    \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Pat Fitzgerald has been fired. A mere week ago that sentence was inconceivable. In a stunning but necessary turn of events what seemed unthinkable just a few days ago has transpired. After 17 seasons as Northwestern’s head coach Fitzgerald has been let go for his failure to prevent hazing and a toxic environment within the school’s football program. The Monday afternoon decision although controversial was the correct one. Whether Fitzgerald himself knew about or participated in the hazing is a moot point. The fact of the matter is that hazing transpired under the watch of Fitzgerald; he failed to protect his players. As a result the fifth-longest tenured FBS coach will not be on Northwestern’s sideline on opening day. Where do we go from here? How will we remember a man who is unarguably both on the field and on the sidelines a Northwestern legend? I grew up a diehard Northwestern fan. Like many of you I adored Coach Fitz. I bought into the culture and ate up the blue-collar tough-as-nails narrative. Fitz was easy to root for; his teams played hard and his interviews were colorful. I was crushed to see the allegations of a rampant hazing culture and heartbroken to learn of their validity. It’s okay to feel mixed emotions. This subject is complex and uncomfortable. If you loved the 1995 team that took a trip to the Rose Bowl with Fitzgerald manning the middle of the defense that’s completely understandable. If you adored the 2009 or 2012 campaigns under Fitz’s leadership that remains okay too. If like me the trips to the Big Ten Championship in 2018 and 2020 nearly moved you to tears those emotions do not get erased.  The recent news does not invalidate any positive memories you have had with Northwestern football. However these memories must be qualified to be understood properly. All of the wins during Fitzgerald’s tenure can still be celebrated along with the great players classic games and breathtaking plays. Yet these must be supplemented with the newfound knowledge that even in winning seasons not every individual was able to enjoy the celebrations because of secretive rituals that hurt traumatized and belittled some players. Even if those experiences are the minority those practices cannot be and should not have been tolerated in a culture that prides itself on integrity and honor. This does not mean that Fitzgerald wasn’t a force for good during his time in Evanston. The outpouring of support and testaments to Fitz’s upstanding nature from former and current players makes it clear that he was admired and esteemed. But both can be true: Fitz can have transformed some lives for the better while allowing for some of the lowest points in others. As the widespread and vocal testimonials on behalf of Fitzgerald continue to roll in it is crucial to reckon with a less than black-and-white reality: none of the stories describing instances where Fitzgerald was supportive uplifting and honorable (which are also part of his legacy) make it impossible for him to have overseen a program that permitted some terrible misdeeds.  In addition to winning games and awards Fitzgerald is also credited for building the team’s culture. But in light of the information learned in the past few days this culture has its own complicated legacy. This culture with more wins than losses on the gridiron evidently had an ugly underbelly with cracks. No amount of wins or awards can justify the inhumanity detailed by several former players and staffers.  All this to say Pat Fitzgerald’s legacy in purple is complex. He is one of the greatest players in program history and the winningest coach by a significant margin. That won’t go away but it is forever tarnished with an asterisk. Despite his achievements Fitzgerald is now unlikely to see a statue commemorated in his honor outside of Ryan Field. His image along with Northwestern’s is permanently stained. This hazing scandal is destined to become an unsettling if not defining chapter in the history of both. In the coming days both the university and the football team will have a lot to answer for. It will be difficult to navigate the path forward both on and off the field but we do know one thing for certain: that path will be without Pat Fitzgerald.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story In a matter of 72 hours things have gone from bad to worse for Northwestern. While already dealing with a hazing controversy related to the football program news broke  via 670 The Score and the Chicago Tribune Monday afternoon that highlighted a variety of allegations against Northwestern baseball coach Jim Foster and the “toxic” environment he created in his first year in Evanston. Inside NU had the chance to speak to several players and people close to the team about what it was like to be a part of the team during the 2022-2023 season. All information reported by 670 The Score’s Danny Parkins and the Chicago Tribune’s Jonathan Bullington will be attributed as such; otherwise the remaining information was confirmed and compiled by Inside NU. The culture around Jim Foster’s baseball team was so bad half the team ended up in therapy. According to someone close to the situation it wasn’t just the team’s performance on the field that suffered as a result of the coach but the mental health of the athletes as well. The environment that the Northwestern baseball players existed in and played in was harmful to everyone involved and roughly 16 players have entered the transfer portal since the conclusion of the season. “Unlike the situation with Fitz you without a doubt will not be seeing any support for him being signed off on by our team which speaks volumes” a transferring player said about Foster referring to the football team’s letter of support of Pat Fitzgerald. According to several people near the situation the head baseball coach made no effort to get to know his players. At practices he was often virtually absent sometimes seen on his computer with his back facing the players. That of course doesn’t even include when he was literally absent. In January there were approximately 18 preseason team workouts. Foster was in attendance for four. “I didn’t even know he was on campus” another former player said. “I was told he was in his office over in Anderson [Hall]. I had no reason to believe he was ever on campus in that month.” In several press conferences and interviews months into the season that Inside NU attended or watched Foster incorrectly pronounced many players’ names. At the end-of-the-year banquet in which parents of the athletes were also present Foster gave speeches to honor each of the graduating seniors. His speeches were brief and seemed “disingenuous” and unprepared with someone in attendance saying it was like he didn’t even know the guys he’d been coaching for nearly a year at all. For one of the seniors at the banquet in front of his family and everyone in attendance Foster said “You know sometimes your natural talent can only take you so far.” Foster may have been often disengaged from the team but it was far worse when he was involved. The coach was abrasive during practices and games to not only the players on the team but also other staff members. Against Saint Louis in March an opposing player hit a ball that got through the infield. According to a player Foster approached an assistant coach who was in charge of defensive positioning after the inning and asked him why the shortstop was in that specific spot on the play. The assistant started to explain his reasoning but Foster responded by getting in his face and yelling “You shut the f—- up!” repeatedly until the assistant walked away. “I have never seen an adult speak to another adult in that disrespectful of a manner” the player said. “Especially not in the dugout in front of a team of players.” Foster’s relationship with the assistant coaches was volatile and the lack of respect given from him to his coworkers was a major reason for the filing of an HR report in November. The document of the report obtained by the Chicago Tribune described “bullying and abusive behavior” from Foster. The Tribune noted that there were times the coach would go into “expletive-laced tirades directed at his staff” and also mentioned inappropriate comments made regarding a female staff member. The HR report found evidence that these claims were true prior to the start of the season yet Northwestern did not make any changes to protect the coaches players and staffers from the abusive environment. As a result two assistant coaches — Dusty Napoleon and Jon Strauss — and the team’s Director of Operations Chris Beacom stepped away from the program around the time of the beginning of the season in late February. The former Army Black Knight coach’s culture was one that lacked accountability for himself and players on the team. If he made a mistake he usually made it someone else’s fault not his own according to a player who has since transferred. “When he was wrong it was never ‘Oh I made a mistake I apologize I’ll fix it’” the player said. The team had a series of signs they’d relay to the position players with specific arm movements and orientations during games. Foster once discussed the signs with the team but did the signs backwards which a player said may have messed the team up. Instead of taking responsibility Foster tried to gaslight the players into believing his way had been correct the whole time. There was also an incident in January between Foster and Strauss in practice. The Wildcats were practicing bunt coverages that didn’t work because no one ended up covering first base and when Strauss called out Foster and said they needed to fix the issues the head coach dismissed the fact that they needed to change anything. This devolved into a screaming match between the two coaches according to someone near the event. ""Accountability was a major issue within Northwestern baseball this year. Under Spencer Allen who coached the Wildcats from 2016-2021 the team had to sign a commitment that if they failed a drug test they were kicked off. A source close to the team said Allens policy created a sense of commitment that was bigger than one’s self something that didn’t exist this year."" There were virtually no punishments for those who didn’t uphold the standards that are normally assumed of Northwestern baseball with one example just being to show up on time for practice. The same source noted there was an athlete who missed a lift workout once and his “punishment” was to get his plane ticket last. The player ended up starting a game the next day. Practices were also “a toss in the air” in how unpredictable they were. Foster often failed to put together plans leaving the responsibility to the assistant coaches and not telling anyone what to do. When he did set up practices it was often on things that a source close to the team said didn’t help them in games. “We would have practices sometimes [when] we’d be bunting in four of our five cages for 30 40 minutes” the source said. “Nothing against bunting but we’re going to go face Texas State Week One and we’re facing Levi Wells throwing 95 [miles per hour]. We have our Spinball machine which can throw 95-mile-per-hour fastballs curveballs sliders any pitch you want. We have it for 85-mile-per-hour fastballs and we’re bunting off of it. That is not the way to win baseball games.” Northwestern ended up losing all three games in the opening weekend to Texas State by a combined score of 56-18. The Wildcats allowed 24 runs in the final game of the series. In practice the players were also instructed to bunt fastballs and hit curveballs. Meanwhile in games they were taking curveballs and hitting fastballs so the time they spent practicing did not help the team in games all that much. This obviously did not translate to winning as the Wildcats went 10-40 in 2023 with a lowly 4-20 record in Big Ten play. Players went so far as to say that from a developmental standpoint none of the players got better because of anything that Foster did. In fact one player said those who improved did so in spite of Foster and because of the massive amounts of work they put in on their own. Another issue that really hit the team hard came right after the season ended regarding Buddy Baseball a “non-competitive recreational league for boys and girls with special needs” according to the Buddy Baseball website. One of the Northwestern managers who regularly volunteers with the organization brought up the idea of the Wildcats helping volunteer to Foster who has a daughter with autism. Foster was on board with the opportunity but it only went downhill from there. The manager told Inside NU that Foster would consistently push back their meetings to set up the event and postpone them without telling her. Eventually they finally met and planned a volunteer date with the help of Northwestern’s Assistant Director of Community Relations Rebekah Sigman. However five days before the event Foster told the manager that since it was during Northwestern’s pre-finals Reading Week NCAA rules prohibited organized team activities and they would have to cancel the event. The ruling though does not prevent the players from volunteering on their own time and after the manager had discussions with Sigman and Northwestern higher-ups players were allowed to go to the event under the presumption that it was on their own time and not an organized activity. Twelve players planned to volunteer at the event. Two hours before the Buddy Baseball game the manager received a text from one of the players saying Foster was not allowing any of them to go even though they had been cleared by Sigman and other members of the Northwestern athletic department. The organization had rescheduled the day to fit with the baseball team’s schedule they had ordered pizza for the event the Buddy Baseball players and parents were all “decked out in Northwestern gear” and when they found out the team wouldn’t be there they were heartbroken. The Wildcat players who were planning on attending understood how bad it made them look but felt even worse inside by the sheer fact that they had promised to go and couldn’t be there even if it was out of their control. “The NCAA prohibits organized activities during specific times and defines what an organized team activity is and this did not fall under it” the manager who quit the team shortly after said. “Someone above him okayed it. He didn’t even give the players a reason he just told the players they couldn’t go.” In the aftermath of the troubling Northwestern baseball season at least 16 players have entered the transfer portal out of the 35 that were on the team’s roster this past year. The team also loses several graduate students and seniors meaning the Wildcats will likely return less than half of their roster if Foster remains as head coach. All three of the team captains from 2023 are also transferring to another school next year two of which would’ve been seniors next year. The ‘Cats are no strangers to losing talent to the transfer portal. Sean Sullivan just became a second-round MLB draft pick after transferring last year to Wake Forest while Ethan O’Donnell (Virginia) and Jay Beshears (Duke) were each sixth-round selections on Monday. However an exodus often comes with a coaching change such as last summer and is highly unusual for a team in which the coach remains at the school. A source involved with the program emphasized just how massive it is for the program to lose not only that many players but also those who are currently rising seniors. “Those are kids that have put three years into this university into the school into the team into this community and are willing to forego their Northwestern education so that they can play for a different head coach” the source said. “That is something that we should be embarrassed by.” Another former player who’s since left NU via the transfer portal echoed the same sentiment. “I feel bad for the underclassmen; this was their first experience of college baseball and it’s not supposed to be like this” the player said. “You’re not supposed to get a new coaching staff midseason. You’re not supposed to be 10-40. I feel for those guys that had to leave through the portal the freshmen and sophomores who are eligible because they’re getting the chance to get a world-class degree taken away from them because their baseball experience wasn’t what it was supposed to be and that’s just not right.” After being recruited to a top 10 academic university with the promise of developing their baseball skills against Big Ten competition many of the same athletes who marched through the Arch with starry eyes and big aspirations will not even get the chance to walk across the graduation stage with their Northwestern degree let alone finish out their collegiate careers in the purple and white. In an average transfer class athletes have a variety of reasons for leaving. For former Northwestern baseball players leaving this year there is one common denominator. Things will likely get worse before they get better. The NU baseball team would likely have to completely reshape its roster to rebuild after the major losses and the program would require a complete culture makeover. However there’s one thing that former players coaches staffers and managers all agree on  and that’s that nothing will get better until Jim Foster is gone. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

After firing 17-year head coach Pat Fitzgerald on Monday rumors have swirled about the direction Northwestern football will take regarding its head coaching position. For now former defensive coordinator David Braun is acting as the team’s head coach with some reports sharing that Braun may eventually be named the interim leader for the 2023 season. Most expectation is that NU will utilize an interim head coach for the year ahead but the possibility exists of making an outside hire especially of a veteran coach. One such name on that list might include former LSU coach Ed Orgeron. According to a source Orgeron “would have interest” in Northwestern’s opening. However the source shared that NU has not contacted Orgeron. Orgeron led the Tigers to the 2019 College Football Playoff title in what is widely regarded as one of the best college football teams ever. He has not coached since being fired from LSU before the team’s 2021 bowl game. Orgeron 61 is a native of Larose Louisiana. The former Northwestern State defensive lineman began his coaching career with the school in 1984.

If you buy something from an SB Nation link Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Share this story Pat Fitzgerald’s firing isn’t about Pat Fitzgerald; it’s about a no-tolerance policy and prohibiting a culture that enables a degrading hierarchy and misrepresents claims of “brotherhood” and “masculinity.” And yes I am not a college athlete nor am I a male. But it’s no secret hazing is bad. It’s definitely not a secret that unwanted sexual acts are illegal. It’s unfathomable to understand how these so-called rites of passage that don’t just humiliate but brutalize others have come to be. Yet here we are with widespread sexual hazing in athletics within and beyond Northwestern.  When considering stereotypes surrounding male athletes and male sexual assault survivors sexual hazing evokes a particularly toxic culture. I’m not saying that other demeaning hazing activities in general are valid. I’m not even saying that freshmen and senior players should immediately be placed on the same caliber. I’m addressing how sexual hazing specifically draws on vulnerable aspects of society to further undermine and isolate young men in an atmosphere that is supposed to embrace toughness and if you will manliness. Those notions of athletics are why even in 2023 sexual hazing somehow is a point of contention debating what is and isn’t sexual assault what explicit activities are jokes and whether someone should be able to take it.  I’ll say it again forced and unwanted sexual acts are crimes. That’s why allegations need to be taken seriously. That’s why athletes need to know they can come forward and will find solace — this isn’t about athletics. As of late that safe environment hasn’t been solidified. The Northwestern whistleblower is still being characterized as a player with a personal vendetta against Fitzgerald. Never mind the investigation that found evidence of hazing and received acknowledgments of its existence from 11 current or former players. Add in the verifications found by reporters.  Look at the two New Mexico State basketball players who were sexually assaulted in their freshman seasons. They detailed in their lawsuit how they were attacked and physically silenced in locker rooms and buses where they were stripped and received painful unwanted touching. During that season teammates never helped stop them and coaches shrugged off the reports. To illustrate head coach Greg Heier was informed on three separate occasions by one victim and was pressured by another coach to act but never did anything.  Look at Isaiah Humphries a former Penn State football player who claims he and others were sexually harassed in the 2018 season. He alleges in his complaint unwanted touching of genitalia being the recipient of simulated and real sexual acts and receiving verbal threats that referenced Jerry Sandusky. His federal lawsuit has been complicated with Penn State filing paperwork to have it dismissed and while two players have corroborated some of Humphries’ allegations others were disputed. Nonetheless the controversy surrounding this case could on one hand induce fear for other victims and on another undermine victims if the allegations are seen as intangible. In all three of these recent incidents there has been a hesitancy to believe and to act. Yes investigations are needed and evidence is crucial. But this process has not been as simple as letting there be a thorough investigation to look into alleged sexual violence. It has not been as simple as understanding others are affected by experiences differently. It has not been as simple as realizing anything like this should not remotely exist in the first place. For whatever reason sexual hazing has been prominent and for male athletes in major programs it’s not difficult to comprehend a fear to be vulnerable. It’s difficult enough to come to terms with sexual assault beyond it being from teammates. Only recently did the sexual abuse perpetrated by physicians Larry Nassar at Michigan State and USA Gymnastics Robert Anderson at Michigan and Richard Strauss at Ohio State come to light. It’s difficult enough for one to reveal hazing beyond the realm of sports. Well sexual hazing is the pretty damning intersection of both and because of the culture surrounding sports teams this physical and emotional degradation that would once again be considered illegal in any other scenario is occurring.  Think about New Mexico State. What happened there was blatant and the head coach chose to ignore it and focus on basketball.  Think about Northwestern which is a school where athletics are not everything and perhaps why the allegations were taken so seriously and why there were so many public condemnations of Fitzgerald. It’s then worth wondering what would happen at institutions where their sports are a universal way of life.  At what point do allegations be taken seriously? At what point does a ritual turn into sexual assault? Is it when high school basketball players in the thousand-person town of La Vernia Texas are penetrated with a cardboard rod a shampoo bottle and a flashlight among other things? What about when Mepham High School football players are held down and forced to sodomize with a broomstick a pine cone or a golf ball?  Those two incidents were over ten years removed. The Mepham sexual assaults took place in 2003; the scandal in La Vernia was revealed in 2017. That’s a large time difference and an even bigger one is two decades. Twenty years later the experiences of those freshman high schoolers who were horrifically abused and forcefully deprived of their innocence as a rite of passage are still relevant.  In trying to undermine the allegations of Northwestern football the seriousness of sexual hazing as a whole is also undermined. This has nothing to do with Fitzgerald and his character it’s about sexual assault occurring and establishing that it must be forbidden. Instead there are claims that it never occurred when it was proven to and debates about its severity and nature when again it was found to have occurred.

Share this story On Monday evening Northwestern finally took the lid off of a pot boiling over by firing Pat Fitzgerald. While many deemed it impossible for Fitzgerald — having turned down NFL opportunities to stay at his alma mater — to not leave on his own terms that very concept came to fruition when university President Michael Schill announced that NU had let go of Fitzgerald following “a difficult and complex evaluation” of the coach’s initial two-week punishment. For the first time since July 7 2006 Northwestern must now operate on an everyday basis without Fitzgerald as its head coach and effectively its focal representative of the program and university. With its season opener still scheduled for Sept. 3 at Rutgers and with preseason training camp slated to begin in just a few weeks NU will presumably attempt to return to some form of “normalcy” at some point even if thinking about strapping up pads and lacing cleats feels asinine at the current moment. Part of that return to operation eventually includes determining who the program’s head coach will be. Right now the answer appears to be David Braun. According to several reports Braun — who was hired to be NU’s defensive coordinator in January — has been named the “acting head coach” with ESPN’s Adam Rittenberg sharing that Braun “could soon be named the interim coach.” Braun had tremendous success as a defensive coordinator with the North Dakota State Bison a program that is consistently one of the best in the nation regardless of its FCS status. The DC led the Bison to two national titles; NDSU’s 2022 defense ranked 39th in the country among all college football teams in Pro Football Focus grade and allowed only 20.2 points per game en route to another FCS Championship appearance. Braun’s resume at the collegiate level speaks for itself. At the same time when Braun first stepped foot into the Walter Athletics Center as Northwestern’s defensive coordinator in January it marked the first time he had ever been a coach at the Power Five level. In fact Braun has still yet to coach in a Power Five game. What I am not saying is that Braun is incapable of being the Wildcats’ head coach for 2023 if not longer. At the same time turning over the keys to a hundred-million-dollar engine to someone with that level of inexperience particularly only six months in Evanston does not feel like a logical move at any time but especially this one. Aside from Braun’s neophyte status making it unwise to name him Northwestern’s interim head coach this fact cannot be ignored: he was hand-picked by Fitzgerald to lead the Wildcats’ defense. Point blank if Northwestern truly wants to start over — to begin to erase memories of the very program it knew under its 17-year guide to craft a culture that sustains winning while actively ensuring the safety of its players — it has no choice but to bring in a coach with no ties to Fitzgerald. It is not Braun’s fault that he is inextricably linked to Fitzgerald a coach whose once-pristine reputation is forever sullied by the claims of an environment that allowed sexual hazing harassment and racism to run rampant. But with Braun and the rest of the team’s 2023 coaching staff — which per Rittenberg will be retained in spite of Fitzgerald’s firing — that connection to Fitzgerald simply cannot disappear. It is currently unknown the extent to which NU assistants were aware of the team’s hazing behaviors. For context one recent former player who shared his accounts with me said that “the assistant coaches and everybody else knew.” Only further university investigation or disclosing specific details of Maggie Hickey’s investigation will shed light on the situation. For now though one cannot definitively claim that Northwestern’s assistant coaches shoulder no blame for permitting such severe actions to occur. Beyond such coaches’ own possible responsibilities the fact of the matter is this: elevating one of Fitzgerald’s former assistants only reinforces his imprint on the program casting his shadow even wider despite his now-permanent absence. Whether Braun or another assistant coach is managing daily program operations as interim head coach Fitzgerald’s mark is still implicitly felt — and that cannot be the case. Effectively then the proper course of action for Northwestern to take to completely rebuild its 141-year football program is to hire an outside coach with no connection to Fitzgerald in the immediate future. Of particular essence is that this hire needs to promptly create a culture with zero tolerance for hazing racism or abuse of any kind. By implementing a new permanent head coach with no ties to Fitzgerald the school would best allow for the disconcerting closing of the latest 17-year chapter of its history and turn the page to a nascent era. In that case minimal thought would be given to simply using 2023 as a year in which the program searches for its identity without much resolution perpetuating its deeper issues with the clouds of Fitzgerald’s scandals looming overhead. It is paramount to note that the school’s and community’s healing process is delicate and should not be rushed in order to simply make transactional moves. The legacy of Fitzgerald’s tenure is still raw for many on all sides and likely will remain that way for years if not decades to come. From a logistics perspective some may question the practicality of conducting a head coaching search with training camp imminent not to mention a multitude of legal questions to be sorted out. It is virtually impossible that all matters will be settled regarding Fitzgerald’s exit in just 53 days. At the same time that span does provide a window for NU to research coaching options. That sentiment is especially true for veteran coaches that the program already knows about — such as Paul Chryst and David Shaw — who have established consistent winning predicated on cultivating a safe environment. Although Stanford faced a situation where its strength coach received a player complaint in 2019 Shaw promptly took action and fired the coach for that very reason. It’s something that Northwestern needs now more than ever. If Northwestern players staffers and coaches walk out of the tunnel in Piscataway New Jersey with Braun or any other former Fitzgerald hire/protégé blazing the path forward it would certainly reflect a team and school in a time of significant change. But unless the team’s head coach is an outside stabilizing presence it would be hard to verify that Athletic Director Derrick Gragg President Michael Schill and other university administrators are serious about re-establishing the foundational principles of Northwestern football on and off the field — unequivocally removed from what Fitzgerald did to damage them. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Braun had been acting as the day-to-day liaison for the program since Fitzgerald was terminated on Monday evening. ""Sources: David Braun has been elevated to Northwesterns interim head coach for the 2023 season."" Braun was originally hired by Fitzgerald in January after former DC Jim O’Neil was relieved of his duties following the 2022 season in late November. Braun spent the past four seasons as the defensive coordinator at North Dakota State where he helped guide the Bison to three national championship appearances capturing the title in 2019 and 2021. In his first season as a coordinator NDSU led the nation in points allowed and yards per game. In 2021 Braun was named Footballscoop’s FCS Coordinator of the Year. Before his time in Fargo Braun took on a variety of roles coaching Northern Iowa from 2017-18 particularly as an outside linebackers and defensive line coach. He spent the two seasons before coaching defensive linemen at UC Davis which followed his four-year tenure as Winona State’s co-defensive coordinator from 2011 to 2014. Leading the ‘Cats will be a tremendous challenge for Braun. He has never coached a single snap at the FBS level but now will oversee an entire Big Ten program in the midst of a major scandal.

Share this story Editor’s note: On July 26 Northwestern president Michael Schill told The Daily Northwestern that Northwestern head coach Jim Foster has been placed on “indefinite suspension.” Schill noted that Foster wasn’t fired but “won’t be coaching again.” This story has been revised to reflect that information. During a meeting with players from the 2023 Northwestern baseball team on Thursday afternoon athletic director Derrick Gragg and NU president Michael Schill shared with the team that head coach Jim Foster has been “relieved of his duties” after he spent one season with the team per a current Northwestern baseball player who remained anonymous in fear of retribution.  The decision comes in the wake of allegations corroborated by nine members of the Northwestern program that Foster “broke the spirit of the team” by creating a team environment riddled with his “abusive behavior” as read on 670 The Score on Monday. Members of the program shared multiple instances of that behavior with Inside NU’s Gavin Dorsey. In place of Foster assistant coach Brian Anderson “will be leading the baseball program” per Gragg. The current Northwestern player revealed that he and other members of the 2023 squad — including some graduating seniors — reached out to Northwestern President Michael Schill by email at about 12 a.m. CT on Wednesday night to request a meeting with him to find out what actions Northwestern was planning to take in the wake of the allegations. The university had not publicly acknowledged any of the reports that had come out in the prior three days and with the NCAA transfer portal set to close at 11:59 p.m. ET on Thursday night multiple players who had remaining eligibility needed to decide if they would remain with Northwestern for the 2024 season. “I think the goal is just to get a meeting and try to get some answers” the current player said before requesting the meeting. “However I can say that most likely the answers we get will affect a lot of returners’ decisions on whether they enter the portal. I can’t speak for each of them but from the guys that I know and I’ve talked to what we hear will impact the decision pretty heavily.” At about 4:15 p.m. CT the players on the email received a message from Claire Weber an executive assistant for Northwestern Athletics with a statement from Gragg inviting the team to meet exactly an hour later regarding a “major update about Northwestern baseball.” Inside NU received a screenshot of the email from the current player. “I know many of you are scattered across the country playing summer ball and may even be on the field as this message hits your phone” Gragg wrote. “So please know this will not be the last conversation we have on the topic. But we did want to absolutely get to you first.”  Gragg did get to the team first albeit after three days of baseball players waiting for updates from the administration on Foster in the wake of the allegations. “Most of us felt like we were just kind of waiting to get that one Zoom link from from Dr. Gragg and he was gonna let us know about some sort of staff change but we never got that” the player said before the meeting. “And every day that kind of went on it was like ‘Okay what’s going on?’ And then all the stuff in the media came out. We’re like ‘Okay for sure. We’re getting it tomorrow for sure. We’re getting it tomorrow.’”  “And we’ve gotten nothing. But that’s kind of what sparked us reaching out because we want to know something right? We just need to know there’s a direction and a plan moving forward because there’s no attention at all on our program.” With Foster’s departure 13 returning players now have more knowledge regarding the state of the program to make a decision in the five hours before the transfer portal closes.  Gragg also sent an email to the players’ parents which was obtained by Inside NU. “Nothing will ever be more important to Northwestern than providing its students a place that allows them to develop in the classroom in the community and in competition at the absolute highest level.” On the field Foster led Northwestern to an abysmal 10-40 record the ‘Cats’ worst record since 1970. NU finished in the bottom 10% in the nation in ERA posting a team average of 8.53 and also in total runs scoring 258 runs in its 2023 campaign.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It’s not clear whether Fitzgerald knew about the hazing going on or if he did to what extent. However one thing is clear Northwestern had no choice but to move on from the most notable coach in its athletics program’s history. As Northwestern tries to move forward from the scandal things are going to get worse before they get better. Fitzgerald was one of the top coaches in the Big Ten and recently signed an extension to keep him in Evanston until 2030; but now Northwestern is searching for their next coach less than two months before the college football season begins. Amidst the reports that the football program is going through Evanston is a less attractive location. While Northwestern is keeping their assistant coaches with David Braun being the day-to-day liaison expect a mass exodus in January 2024. If Fitzgerald was fired due to possible knowledge of hazing other staff members might be too. Also some might not want to be there at all. Coach-wise Northwestern is also in a tough spot relative to the rest of the conference. The Big Ten has a lot of mainstay coaches — Jim Harbaugh Mel Tucker Ryan Day James Franklin P.J. Fleck Brett Bielema Kirk Ferentz to name a few — who have had success and will not be going anywhere in the relative future. Lincoln Riley and Chip Kelly with USC and UCLA respectively join the Big Ten in the 2024 season. This is the immediate competition the head coach will have to go through. With Fitzgerald Northwestern won the coaching battle against many Big Ten teams. Under whoever’s next the same cannot be said. Even before hazing allegations put Northwestern in a cloud of uncertainty the team finished 1-11 last season and has not won a game in the United States since October 2021. Their one win last season was against a Nebraska squad with Scott Frost as coach making questionable decisions and we all know how that went. That 1-11 squad had arguably its four best players in Peter Skoronski Evan Hull Cam Mitchell and Adetomiwa Adeboware depart for the NFL. Is there any argument that next year’s team can be better?  Yes the football program just had a decent transfer class come in. Ben Bryant should get the first starter reps come training camp and A.J. Henning slots in as the wide receiver one and those both help the team that was the worst offense in the Big Ten last year. But Henning expressed his frustration on social media after Fitzgerald was fired. Another effect of Fitzgerald’s firing is players now have a month to enter their names into the transfer portal. Though none have yet expect a few to: Fitzgerald has been the reason many talented players commit to Northwestern. They buy into his culture his style his playbook. This is all gone. Players will look elsewhere as will the ‘Cats’ newest class of recruits. To summarize it all: the team that went 1-11 lost its four best players with a hazing investigation that leaves darkness over the program and is in a strong conference that only seems to get better. It’s hard to see Northwestern succeeding in the immediate future. Is there hope? A little. Northwestern is still a Power Five program with elite academics in a strong conference. But combine the lack of success over the past two years with what’s come up recently and that hope is slim. There will be decommitments. There will be transfers. There will be negative connotations associated with Northwestern just like there are now with Fitzgerald’s entire term that was covered in gold for Northwestern fans. The light at the end of the tunnel is farther away than many may think and it might be a while until Northwestern football finds it.    \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After multiple allegations of sexual hazing inside Northwestern’s football program were reported and confirmed by investigator Maggie Hickey several lawsuits are imminent against the broader university and a myriad of athletic programs. On Monday morning civil rights attorney Ben Crump and the law firm Levin & Perconti announced that former Northwestern student-athletes have retained the duo as council to bring a lawsuit against NU. In a press release the lawyers say that they have uncovered “a vast array of incidents of abuse in the Northwestern Football Program.” In their discovery the lawyers claim that one of the former student-athletes was 17 years old — considered a minor — when he arrived on campus. For context Crump represented student-athletes in abuse cases against Michigan State University and Ohio State University. The lawyers said that they expect more student-athletes to join the suit and expand into other programs across collegiate athletics. As of now the suit which will be filed in the “reasonable near future” stands at more than 15 former Northwestern student-athletes and includes former Wildcat players from football baseball and softball. “It involved scores of athletes over a long period of time in a very public form” said Steve Levin about Northwestern’s hazing in a Wednesday morning press conference. Regarding softball Crump mentioned that team culture “seems to have been as toxic as the football program” and that he believes more details will be revealed. Former Northwestern football players Lloyd Yates (2015-17) Warren Long (2013-17) Tom Carnifax (2016-19) and Simba Short (2015-16) who are represented by Crump were in attendance at the presser and spoke to the media. “The university and the football program has let us down. That’s why we’re here today” Yates said. Carnifax added that he “spent the last four years hating myself” because of what he experienced at Northwestern. Crump concluded his press conference by saying “Northwestern you can be the example here.” Furthermore two lawsuits — the latter of which is expected Wednesday — will be filed by former Northwestern football players who remain anonymous. The players claim they were victims of hazing across their years of playing: 2018-22. Both suits will be filed in Cook County by Salvi Schostok & Pritchard P.C named the university President Michael Schill former President Morton Schapiro the Board of Trustees Athletic Director Derrick Gragg and former head coach Pat Fitzgerald as defendants in the lawsuit; meanwhile the suit to be filed Wednesday also named former Athletic Director Jim Phillips as a defendant. All defendants were sued in their official capacity meaning that Northwestern not the individual defendants would be liable for damages and have to pay the restitution. In the complaint already filed with the court a plaintiff alleges that Fitzgerald “took part in the harassment hazing bullying assault and/or the abuse of athletes.” The complaint states that the plaintiff is seeking over $50000 in damages. In a Wednesday press conference attorney Patrick Salvi Jr. claimed that there are troubling allegations inside the Northwestern baseball softball volleyball and cheerleading programs as well as football. In particular Salvi shared that hazing inside NU volleyball “appears to have led to the cancellation of a game.” Further the lawyers mentioned that ArentFox Schiff the external firm hired by Northwestern has a “close relationship” with the school’s general counsel office and demanded the full details of Hickey’s investigation be shared. “It’s not just one program. It’s not just one coach” attorney Parker Stinar said. In addition to lawsuits on behalf of former Northwestern student-athletes Fitzgerald has engaged in simultaneous legal action. The former head coach has retained attorney Dan Webb “to take the necessary steps to protect my rights in accordance with the law.” Webb told ESPN’s Adam Rittenberg that Fitzgerald was fired for cause meaning that Northwestern would not have to pay out the $42 million remaining on his contract. Webb says that there were major breaches of contract by NU towards the former ‘Cats’ head coach and that he is evaluating possible litigation. “We look forward to defending Coach Fitzgerald and taking all steps to protect his legal rights name and reputation” Webb said in a statement on Tuesday.

Share this story The NBA Summer League stretched from July 7 to July 17 this year in Las Vegas. While all eyes were on high-profile rookies like first overall pick Victor Wembanyama three former ‘Cats basketball players showed their worth battling to find themselves on an NBA roster come October. Chase Audige Pete Nance and Elyjah Williams were Northwestern’s three representatives in the league a respectable number for a program just starting to come into its own. It’s one more than Illinois but who’s counting? (I am; it’s also two more than Wisconsin and Rutgers in case anyone was wondering). Today let’s take a look at how all three players fared in the league. Chase Audige Let’s start with the guy who matters most to Northwestern fans Purdue’s worst nightmare and reigning Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year: Chase Audige. Back in May Audige elected to keep his name in the draft instead of returning to school. Assuming the talented guard had the right people in his ear he probably knew he was unlikely to hear his name called on draft night but going the undrafted route isn’t always a mistake. It’s opportunities like the Summer League though that become crucial. The Miami Heat granted Audige that opportunity this year. Audige’s performance didn’t set the world on fire but it was just fine. In Vegas he averaged 5.4 points a night shooting 47.6% from the field with 1.2 steals (his bread and butter in college). This all came in 14 minutes per contest including one start. That didn’t include his 18-point showing on 6-of-9 shooting at the Golden 1 Center in the California Classic which took place a few days before the action in Vegas tipped off. During the five games in Las Vegas Audige connected on less than one three-ball per game which somewhat explains his mediocre scoring totals. Long range was important for him in college especially later in his career as his jump shot improved.  Pete Nance For all the Northwestern fans who still love Pete Nance his performance in the Summer League was encouraging. Not only did his team the Cavaliers win the entire thing his individual numbers were also solid. After a frustrating year at UNC Nance posted 7.2 points per game on 47.2% shooting with 3.3 rebounds in the Summer League. Like Audige nothing jumps off the page but everything seems about in line with what one would have expected. Nance did not disappoint in Vegas. For all the Northwestern fans who got on Pete Nance for heading to UNC well I doubt a Summer League title tastes as sweet as an NCAA Tournament berth.  Elyjah Williams Williams was a UDFA last year after completing his senior season at NU and was included on the Orlando Magic’s Summer League roster this year. He did not see game action however so there’s not really anything new to evaluate. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story In the wake of Pat Fitzgerald’s firing just under two weeks ago a non-stop news cycle has emerged out of Evanston Illinois. From a litany of litigation in the works to President Michael Schill implementing an outside firm to monitor Northwestern Athletics’ “accountability mechanism” there has hardly been a lull in one of the more traditionally quiet times of the sports season. A key part of the dominoes to fall in that span included Northwestern identifying its head football coach for the season ahead: David Braun. Braun who was hired from North Dakota State as the team’s defensive coordinator in January is tasked with undertaking significantly more responsibilities — especially for someone who has never coached at the FBS level. With Braun being elevated from DC to interim head coach we can infer that the Chicago North Shore native will have final say in making depth chart decisions reaching in-game conclusions and ultimately in creating a healthy culture in a sudden post-Fitzgerald landscape. At the same time Braun will almost certainly not have as all-encompassing of an impact as his predecessor did if simply because the Wildcats’ season starts in just over 40 days. When Braun ventured from Fargo North Dakota to Evanston in January he had begun the process of installing his own modified defensive system as the team’s new defensive coordinator. At the time Braun described it to me as a mix of around 50% of his own concepts with the rest replete with designs that worked under former NU DCs Mike Hankwitz and Jim O’Neil. With such a hasty leadership transition and such little time left for any sweeping alterations it’s probable that Northwestern’s 2023 defense will still be molded to Braun’s expectations and specifications — meaning a 4-3 base featuring safeties in the box and disguises in coverage. Yet even with Braun’s framework in place it’s unlikely that he will completely oversee that side of the ball. For now Braun is listed as the team’s interim head coach and defensive coordinator but it would seem implausible for him to bear both major roles in full for an entire campaign. NU has yet to announce whether any of its other assistants will be elevated in any capacity but don’t be surprised if Associate Head Coach/Safeties Coach Matt MacPherson or Linebackers Coach Tim McGarigle is named the team’s new defensive coordinator. Each has been in their position since 2018 and has familiarity with the schematics Braun will likely incorporate. Additionally Northwestern appears to be adding more external assistance in the form of Eastern Washington Defensive Coordinator Jeff Copp who worked with Braun at UC Davis in 2015. Copp has not coached at the Power Five level since he was a graduate assistant at Arizona State from 2001-03; moreover his defense was abysmal last season surrendering 42.4 points and 504 yards per game. It’s unclear what Copp’s title will be if he is indeed hired but he could also be named Northwestern’s DC. Whether MacPherson McGarigle Copp or someone else I’d expect Braun to hand over defensive coordinator reins as well as defensive play-caller duties to someone else before Sept. 3. Offensively Mike Bajakian will remain Northwestern’s offensive coordinator despite the coaching change. Though the Wildcats’ offense was woeful last year the fourth-year OC will still be the principal actor steering the team’s scoring ship even without Fitzgerald. Notably though NU added former Rutgers and Oklahoma State offensive coordinator Sean Gleeson to its staff in June. Although Fitzgerald hired Gleeson initially the former Williams quarterback will keep his role as a senior offensive assistant at Northwestern according to the school’s Athletic Department . Gleeson figures to have sway regarding offensive tendencies in light of his Power Five experience and success at multiple stops in the college football world. Just as Fitzgerald presumably would have Braun will likely consult with Gleeson as well as Bajakian to review gameplans. A former linebacker Fitzgerald was never known to be an offensive aficionado. The same would theoretically apply to Braun once a defensive lineman at Winona State. But Braun could be inclined to turn to fruitful offensive concepts used during his time under Matt Entz at NDSU — maybe even utilizing fullbacks more frequently — especially if his team’s offense is futile to start the year. Having ascended from first-time FBS defensive coordinator to Big Ten head coach in under six months Braun will seek both homeostasis and shifts as Northwestern’s new leader. Both sides of the ball figure to be impacted by youthful guide particularly with the ‘Cats’ defense being tailored to the outlines Braun has had in place since he arrived. Nonetheless assistant coaches new and old are likely to shoulder more decision-making to alleviate the pressure on Braun. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Four sources close to the Northwestern volleyball program — including three recent former players — confirmed that a hazing incident occurred in March 2021 as detailed in a lawsuit filed Monday morning on behalf of a former Northwestern volleyball player. All four also shared that head coach Shane Davis was not around the team well after the hazing incident. Northwestern never publicly disclosed any information about the hazing or Davis’ time away from the team — leaving viewers to learn of Davis not being there only by watching matches. Moreover two players said that the head coach had to sign a document indicating his involvement in the hazing. Inside NU reached out to the university for comment regarding Davis’ absence and if the coach was required to sign a document but had not heard back at the time of publishing. Update: In a statement provided to Inside NU following the publication of this article Northwestern spokesperson Jon Yates confirmed that Davis and the rest of NU’s coaching staff were suspended following the hazing incident. Yates also indicated that AD Derrick Gragg met with the plaintiff “last year.” The lawsuit filed by Patrick Salvi II and Parker Stinar alleges that Davis was “suspended” for a “period of time during the hazing investigation.” While sources differed as to whether the coach was technically suspended or put on probation all confirmed to Inside NU that Davis’ time away extended beyond the team’s postponed games lasting through the team’s Senior Night against Minnesota on March 27 2021. Two said that Davis was not with the team through the end of the spring 2021 season. In the days after the hazing event Northwestern’s March 12-13 2021 matches at Wisconsin were postponed due to “a pause in Northwestern team activities” according to a release at the time. All former players shared that these games were canceled due to the team’s hazing investigation. In a statement to ESPN university spokesperson Jon Yates wrote that “appropriate disciplinary action was taken” after the event and that NU “cancelled two games and implemented mandatory anti-hazing training.” The Wildcats also did not play March 20-21 2021 at Indiana “as Northwestern safely progresses through return-to-play protocols” a joint statement revealed from both programs. Yet two former players indicated that such postponements were in part due to the ongoing hazing investigation — not COVID-19 protocols. In the lawsuit filed the lawyers allege that the player was “forced to run suicides in the gymnasium while diving to the floor each time she reached a line on the court” as a result of “allegedly” violating the team’s COVID-19 protocols; the player consequently “suffered physical injuries” that “required medical attention.” Moreover the lawsuit posits that a hazing investigation was launched the day subsequent to the incident. Three sources corroborated to Inside NU that a player was forced to run due to breaking team COVID-19 policy as well as that the player physically suffered as a result. In particular two shared that the player ran until she vomited while one added that the player “bled all over the floor.” The plaintiff claims that Davis and assistant coach Kristen Kelsay who is currently the associate head coach at Minnesota “permitted” Northwestern’s team captains to “pick” the punishment for the player. Two former players confirmed that the punishment was player-led. Regarding broader coaching practices the lawyers allege that players “would at times be required to run in front of the team” and that Davis “permitted and encouraged” NU captains to lead punishments. Former players shared similar experiences with Inside NU. “It was kind of a general understanding of you want the captains-led thing because Davis would just make you run even more than what the captains would do” one player said. About Davis’ leadership style the player added “It was always kind of a weird push-pull of do you want us to be a player-led team or do you want to handle this?” Beyond making players run as discipline the lawsuit suggests that Davis had a practice called “Coach-on-one” in which he was “blasting volleyballs at the player and across the gymnasium while that player had to repeatedly run and hit the ball” in front of the “entire” team. One former player directly confirmed this punitive behavior. “He would throw [volleyballs] so far that you had no chance of getting it but you still kind of had to kind of throw and fling your body at it. Then he’d throw another one in the other direction; you had to go get it” the player shared. “I was like ‘Okay that’s a little bit much.’” The lawyers also allege that the plaintiff met with Gragg during the 2021-22 academic year “concerning the culture of Northwestern’s volleyball program.” A player that Inside NU spoke to shared that she also emailed Davis — and included Gragg in the email — after the 2022 season about this incident and her other complaints surrounding the state of the program. The lawsuit mentions that a “culture meeting” was held during the 2022-23 academic year following “multiple complaints” against Davis but that the school “took no actions.” Additionally multiple former players described Davis as a coach who was withdrawn with two sharing that the coach was particularly less willing to punish after this hazing incident and investigation. “Even though Davis wasn’t there it wasn’t like the team was missing anything offensive coordinator-wise” a player said about the coach’s absence during the spring of 2021. “He never made practice plans” another shared. “He would be in the corner on his phone during practice. During games if he did call timeout he would look for our assistant coaches’ confirmation.” In the lawsuit the plaintiff claims that Davis “enabled a culture of racism.” One former player said that Davis made racist comments about players’ hair “throughout the years.” However no other source that Inside NU spoke to mentioned racism within the program or from Davis. The plaintiff played at NU from 2019-23 and claims to have been the victim of this hazing incident. This lawsuit marked the first from a former Northwestern athlete against a program other than football as well as the first from a female sport since President Michael Schill released an executive summary regarding ArentFox Schiff’s investigation of hazing within Northwestern football on July 7. In the lawsuit the defendants named were Northwestern; Davis; Northwestern Presidents Morton Shapiro and Schill; the school’s board of trustees; and Athletic Directors Jim Phillips and Derrick Gragg. At the time of the incident Phillips had already taken over as ACC Commissioner while Gragg was yet to have been hired. NU’s acting athletic director in March 2021 was Janna Blais who was not listed as a defendant but “knew and/or should have known about the hazing incident” according to the lawsuit.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Share this story Note: This story was published before 3 p.m. CT when Northwestern’s three player representatives — Bryce Gallagher Rod Heard II and Bryce Kirtz — announced that they would not be attending Big Ten Media Days in Indianapolis on Wednesday. Imagine you had the chance to ask a genie three questions of your choosing. The opportunities would be endless. How old would you be when you died? How successful would you become in your career? Would your favorite NFL team win a Super Bowl in your lifetime? Now imagine that genie is an assortment of Northwestern’s football personnel and your three questions are actually a 60-minute all-you-can-eat buffet of queries. Suddenly the questions would become much more pointed and much more impactful. For a few of Inside NU’s own the chance to probe interim head coach David Braun and a trio of players will present itself on Wednesday at Big Ten Media Days. The ‘Cats’ representatives are set to take questions from journalists for a short window opening the door for the public to get a glimpse into the state of NU football.  Braun linebacker Bryce Gallagher defensive back Rod Heard II and wideout Bryce Kirtz will be the first members of the program to officially address the media in the midst of a hazing scandal that brought on the firing of Pat Fitzgerald and a plethora of lawsuits against a variety of school officials.  The nature of the media outing is to discuss the upcoming season so the odds are high that the coach and his players will refuse to comment on any of the events from the past few weeks. Still that doesn’t mean they are exempt from having to talk about the ramifications of the scandal on the looming season which lingers just weeks away.  Today we’ll dive into the biggest questions that await Braun and Co. in Indianapolis where the Media Days are being held. 1. For Braun what is the message to the locker room heading into the season? How do you gain players’ respect and keep them invested in the success of the program? Braun is facing one of the most unique challenges in college football. After serving as a defensive coordinator at an FCS school — albeit a high-caliber one — he’s been catapulted to the role of head coach at a Big Ten university.  After such a meteoric jump in program pedigree and now coaching players who came out of high school with three or four stars attached to their name the question for Braun has to be how he can command the respect of a locker room rattled with adversity. He’s already made it over his biggest hurdle — keeping most of his roster out of the transfer portal in the wake of Fitzgerald’s firing. Still with no proven track record on the FBS level and a resumé that was tailored for a coordinator role Braun needs to address his methodology for the upcoming season. Is he attempting a culture overhaul — one that seems desperately needed after the reports of the past few weeks? If so how does he get his guys to buy in? 2. For Gallagher what impact might the hiring of a new — relatively inexperienced — defensive coordinator have on the ‘Cats’ defense heading into the season? What areas are most important for a new DC to be able to improve within NU’s system? Gallagher was a standout on last year’s 1-11 team. He’s one of the few elite players on the team who either didn’t enter the NFL Draft or hit the transfer portal. Now a junior he’ll be expected to be the voice of reason on a team overflowing with anger manifested in the form of Twitter debates and anonymous appearances in ESPN articles. Football Scoop reported last week that Braun is working to close in on hiring Jeff Copp Eastern Washington’s defensive coordinator in the same position at NU. The move would be surprising if it happened given that Copp’s defense boasted the second-worst total defense in the FCS last season.  Assuming Copp joins the staff it’d be interesting to hear Gallagher’s outlook on the season ahead. In general how does a new DC change the team’s approach and philosophy? More specifically is there any reservation among players working for a coach whose track record is less than scintilating? Doubtless the ‘Cats have many departments to improve in on the defensive side of the ball. When a unit gives up 28.3 points per game and almost 200 yards per contest on the ground reformation is necessary. Gallagher’s insight into his own wishlist for a new DC would add some good context to the hiring process. 3. For Heard and Kirtz how have the various transfers (both those coming in and those leaving) appeared to impact the receiving corps? One of the most dynamic position groups for NU over the last six months has been the wide receivers. In 2022 it was also one of the shakiest spots for the ‘Cats as the wideout room only contributed 10 touchdowns and just over 2500 yards the whole year. Malik Washington and Genson Hooper-Price departed Evanston for UVA and Coastal Carolina respectively. Washington totaled 694 receiving yards last season — almost triple the yardage of the team’s next best receiver. Hooper-Price tallied played in 11 of the team’s games but he never made a significant impact. Before Fitzgerald was axed he managed to bring in Cam Johnson and A.J Henning from other Power 5 schools.   With so much change in one of the most pivotal position groups on the team it’d be of interest to hear how Heard a staple in the secondary and Kirtz now the team’s most seasoned pass-catcher expect the receivers to fare in the 2023 campaign. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Following one of the more unsettling and unsuspecting scandals in the recent history of college athletics the Northwestern community has become fractured — no matter one’s vantage point. The time since July 7 when the executive summary of Maggie Hickey’s investigation into allegations of hazing within NU football was released has been raw challenging and without a clear path forward. On Wednesday a significant step was taken in re-establishing some sense of identity within not just the Wildcats’ football program but also the school. For the first time a Northwestern public official would face the media not just share delicately worded statements in email releases. It was not President Michael Schill nor Athletic Director Derrick Gragg. It was interim head coach David Braun. Frankly it was easy to empathize with Braun heading into Big Ten Football Media Days. After becoming a first-time Power Five coordinator only six months ago he was catapulted to precipitous heights as the head coach of NU — let alone on the heels of a one-win team grappling with allegations of widespread sexual hazing. Further Braun who had rarely spoken to reporters as a longtime defensive coordinator would now do so on a national stage. While some may have entered Lucas Oil Stadium expecting to issue sympathy points for Braun the Wildcats’ head coach made it clear: he doesn’t want others to feel bad for him. If anything he’s relishing a tremendous challenge. “Our guys right now in that facility are going through a lot” Braun said in his opening presser. “We have an opportunity to either run from that or an opportunity to truly stare that adversity in the face stare it down and go attack this opportunity to make this fall an incredible story that truly embodies what this team’s all about.” Inherently framing what occurred in the confines of Northwestern’s locker rooms and facilities as “adversity” obscures the player- and coach-led nature of the team’s hazing allegations. When asked questions about details surrounding claims and lawsuits Braun repeated that he would not comment on pending litigation nor has he asked players about events before he arrived in January. Yet Braun was also emphatic about a no-tolerance policy for hazing moving forward. The former North Dakota State defensive coordinator consistently stressed protecting the safety of his players. “At the forefront of my mind is going to be the student-athlete experience. Hazing has no place in that” he said. Despite the firing of 17-year head coach Pat Fitzgerald under two months before the team’s season opener Braun continued to express his expectation in the team’s readiness to suit up on the gridiron starting Sept. 3. “Let me be clear: through all these one-on-one meetings and seeing our team the last two weeks I firmly believe that this group has a demeanor has a brotherhood and a resolve” he said. “There is a reason to be very excited about the story that they will write this fall.” While sharing his unwavering faith in his team through his composed answers Braun was genuine and candid — which he’s remained not only since he arrived in Evanston but also throughout his coaching career. Braun outlined the macro- and micro-level hurdles that he’ll need to clear including player frustration over the firing of Fitzgerald not being a “people-pleaser” still getting familiar with his players on a personal level selling recruits on Northwestern and restoring a winning product. “I’m not saying that I’ve been perfect in this at all” Braun admitted. “I’ll continue to say it: I walk into that facility or hop on a phone or even a text message. Is this supporting our players? Is this serving our players? That’s what I’m here for right now. And I try to do my best to do just that.” After coaching at Winona State Culver-Stockton UC Davis Northern Iowa and NDSU it was easy to understand how ecstatic Braun was to coach at Northwestern in the first place let alone as the Wildcats’ head coach. Braun became emotional several times reflecting on his journey which took a wildly sudden turn. “I don’t know if the full gravity of that hit me until last night” Braun said. “I’m very thankful for a lot of people praying for me right now. I’m thankful for the maturing process I’ve gone through over the course of the last five years of truly understanding what matters and who I truly answer to.” On preparing for Wednesday Braun shared that he “wanted to make sure that my words were certainly empathizing with anyone that’s gone through something and has been a victim of hazing is in full support of our team our staff and those that are at our facility.” When Northwestern begins its 2023 fall camp later this week an impossible-to-ignore cloud remains positioned squarely above Evanston. A Wildcat team which hasn’t won on American soil since October 2021 will look to regroup without its veteran head coach. On a meta level it will have to do so with disturbing allegations and lawsuits still swirling. As the calendar turns to September it’s unclear what fan support will look like among a divided community. But as of late July Braun could have hardly better cemented himself as the person to lead Northwestern in its attempt to move ahead. “If I’m going to ask our players to stare this thing down and take on this adversity and come together it was absolutely critical that I showed up [in Indianapolis] and stared this down and started to pave a roadmap for how we’re going to move forward” Braun said. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Last year the Wildcats won 16 games (the most since 2016) made the Sweet 16 of the College Cup for the third time in program history and went 13 games without a loss. Their schedule — and path to repeating that success — came out on July 18. ""Its here. Our 2023 schedule out    . pic.twitter.com/597pCzgb5C"" While it’s unlikely the ‘Cats will be able to recreate the magic of last season completely they should still be a formidable contender in the Big Ten. A big reason for that is the relative ease of the non-conference schedule. Unlike last season where Northwestern played four of its first five games on the road the Wildcats have four home appearances in their first seven matches.  It also seems as though the quality of non-conference opponent will take a slight dip. Last year the ‘Cats upset No. 19 Xavier and No. 6 Stanford in consecutive games. This year their out of conference slate includes just two teams that made the College Cup last year. Those two squads Vanderbilt and Virginia Tech will both be road affairs for Northwestern. However neither team ended last year ranked in the top 40 in RPI whereas Northwestern finished 14th. Also the ‘Cats played Vanderbilt in the second round of the College Cup defeating the Commodores in a 2-1 slugfest. None of the other non-conference opponents should strike fear in the hearts of Wildcat faithful. In fact none of them finished last season in the top 100 in RPI. Two of Northwestern’s opponents Weber State and Toledo finished worse than 275th in RPI last year. While a record similar to last year’s 6-1-1 is easily attainable out of conference the Wildcats’ Big Ten success may be slightly harder to replicate. The seven-game unbeaten streak to open conference play last season was bolstered by six games with multiple goals an output  that will probably be trickier to reach this year.  Despite those worries it is highly likely that Northwestern will start Big Ten play on a roll. None of the ‘Cats’ first four opponents — Purdue Michigan Indiana or Illinois — cracked the top 100 in RPI.  As the calendar flips to October however the road gets a little rougher. Nebraska was one of only five teams to score multiple goals in a game against Northwestern last year and they will likely come into Evanston hungry for a win after four straight matches against Big Ten teams who were top-50 in RPI last year.  The Nebraska matchup begins a rollercoaster ride for the Wildcats. After that matchup they’ll visit a solid Wisconsin team then travel to Iowa in an attempt to get revenge for last year’s stunning loss on Senior Night. The Iowa matchup should be pretty winnable but it was also winnable last year.  After that a Penn State squad that blanked the Wildcats in the Big Ten Tournament comes to town in what could be the biggest test of the season for Northwestern. After another home contest against an average Minnesota team the ‘Cats will have to travel to Rutgers.  The Rutgers contest marks the end of the regular season. Much like the Penn State game it will serve as a litmus test of sorts for the hopes of this year’s Northwestern squad. While the Wildcats went 1-0-1 against the Scarlet Knights last season Northwestern dominated both games offensively. If the ‘Cats want to prove that they’re serious contenders not just in the Big Ten but nationally they’ll have to convert a lot more shots against Rutgers than they did last year.  Overall this schedule seems much easier than last year’s. While Northwestern did battle with five ranked opponents last season this year’s schedule will have no more than three opponents in the top 25 of the preseason rankings. The main issue is that three of the four toughest contests (Vanderbilt Virginia Tech Rutgers) are all on the road. ""However the Wildcats finished last season 7-1-1 on the road so they’ve shown the ability to win matchups away from Martin Stadium. Assuming the team can avoid the slip-ups of last season (the losses to Kansas and Iowa come to mind) theres a chance the ‘Cats could have consecutive seasons with 15 wins for the first time in program history.

They have responded in this time with exceptional work ethic resolve perseverance through an incredibly difficult time.  “In all my one on one meetings time with our players during workouts it has been absolutely inspiring. It is an honor to be here representing Northwestern University our football program and most importantly our players back in Evanston preparing to have a successful season this fall. I never could have imagined nor did I desire to become a head coach under these types of circumstances. That said I’m honored to lead this group moving forward.  “With a dad from Ohio born in the north suburbs of Chicago and moving to Wisconsin in elementary school my childhood was filled with Big Ten football. Watching Northwestern games with dad many Saturdays in Camp Randall rooting on the Badgers it was part of my life. It was part of my memories with my dad; we won’t acknowledge who my dad roots for. We’ve had a very clear understanding that he’ll be rooting for the ‘Cats moving forward.  “But there was a great deal of appreciation built up for what Big Ten football is the ultimate student-athlete experience. Top-notch academics and high-end football on Saturdays. Prioritizing the student-athlete experience I dreamt of playing in the Big Ten. That never became a reality but an opportunity to work in the Big Ten coach in the Big Ten and coach and mentor these young men is something that I don’t take lightly. I vividly remember in 1995 watching Northwestern beat ninth-ranked Notre Dame — incredible. It still sticks with me to this day. The following year I’m sitting in the stands with a childhood friend watching Northwestern take on Wisconsin. In improbable circumstances Ron Dayne fumbles with under a minute left to go. A few plays later to find Steve Schnur connects with Dwayne Bates on a double move and one of the most improbable Northwestern wins in Northwestern history.  “Again this opportunity is a dream come true to be a part of Big Ten football. I say all this to say that when Coach Fitz offered our family the opportunity to come to Northwestern back in January. And I started work on Jan. 16 of this year. My wife and I had to pinch ourselves: an opportunity to coordinate in the Big Ten to work for a man like Coach Fitz to be close to my family in Wisconsin to be a part of the Big Ten and the opportunity to mentor young men that value what Northwestern stands for — a world-class education competing on the biggest stage in college football. This obviously has been a very difficult time for our team our staff our current and former players impacted our alumni the university. and the broader Northwestern community.” “I am grateful to the Northwestern leadership and Dr. Gragg for entrusting me with leading this program moving forward. The circumstances surrounding our family’s opportunity and being elevated the interim head coach were not dream-like scenarios but they have done one thing. They have crystallized our family’s purpose. Kristin and I truly believe that football is the ultimate vehicle to have a positive impact on young men. Our number one priority moving forward will be ensuring that the student-athlete experience for the young men that we coach and mentor is just that: the ultimate student-athlete experience. With the evolving landscape of college football and there being more emphasis put into talent acquisition transactional relationships we have an opportunity to firmly commit to the values of Northwestern University to firmly commit to what this program has been built off of — and that is the holistic development of the young men that we mentor and coach.  “I told our players a couple of weeks ago moving forward it is my ultimate purpose to number one make sure that the four people back home are taken care of. Beyond that I’m here to support and serve them moving forward. Through one-on-one meetings with the majority of our team I have found a team that has come together that truly loves one another and has an incredible resolve to attack the 2023 season and write their own story about overcoming adversity. Let me be clear this football team will be ready to go. I look forward to coming together as a team a staff and athletic administration a university an alumni base a fan base to fully support these student athletes as they go make us all proud moving forward.” Now to talk some football. Very excited about what we have coming back on the offensive side of the ball. There’s a great deal of depth at all positions. The loss of Peter Skoronski on the O-line will certainly be a big hit. But I truly believe under offensive staff our O-line has a chance to show that depth play with depth and find ways to establish the run in the big Ten. The tight end group is one of the deeper tight end groups I’ve been around and that’s saying a lot after coming from North Dakota State. Excited about our running back room and the return of Cam Porter. Armon Binns our wide receiver coach has done a tremendous job getting this wide receiver group to a point where we feel like we can really lean on the depth in that room to utilize the passing game. The quarterback battle will be something that will be fun to see as the fall moves forward. The addition of Ben Bryant the return of Brendan Sullivan and a young man from the south side of Chicago Jack Lausch will provide a great deal of competition and fall camp.” “Defensively we look forward to a D-line room that Coach [Christian] Smith has done a great job of building through some transfers and the development of a young group with a great deal of talent. A veteran linebacker room a ton of depth in the safety room. And an athletic corner room that’s inexperienced but has a great leader in Garnett Hollis as we move forward. Special teams will continue to play a critical role in finding ways to win on Saturdays for Northwestern. “At the end of the day and one of the first things that we did as a staff in the last couple of days was having an opportunity to sit down and have an honest conversation about how we’re going to win football games at Northwestern this year. And it’s not going to just be our defense. It won’t just be our offense. It’s going to require complementary football that puts us into situations to win in the fourth quarter. Again let me be clear: through all these one-on-one meetings and seeing our team the last two weeks I firmly believe that this group has a demeanor has a brotherhood and a resolve. There is a reason to be very excited about the story that they will write this fall. With that said I’ll open it up to questions. On finding out he was the new Northwestern head coach and having the trust of his players: “It’s all been very emotional. Highs and lows. But to know that our family has the full support of our players means everything to Kristin and I and our staff. It’s a special group of young men.” On assistant coaches Matt MacPherson and Jay Hooten being named in lawsuits filed: “I won’t speak to the current allegations. Fully trust that our university is going through a process and will make decisions based on the facts. What I can speak to is how proud I am of the way that our team has come together with all this stuff floating around our football team. There’s absolute resolve and confidence from our leadership within our team of how we’re going to more forward.” On his message to the team: “The first thing that I told them was that it was my responsibility moving forward to give them clarity and direction. My intent was to be there to support and serve them moving forward. I challenged the group. A lot of people have been impacted by decisions made over the course of the last couple weeks. Our guys right now in that facility are going through a lot. We have an opportunity to either run from that or an opportunity to truly stare that adversity in the face stare it down and go attack this opportunity to make this fall an incredible story that truly embodies what this team’s all about. I’ve challenged them with that and I can say that they have responded to that challenge in an absolutely inspiring fashion.” Side Presser On recent events: “We knew the move was going to be a whirlwind for sure. What we’ve experienced the last two weeks never could’ve anticipated something like this. An opportunity for me to be grateful for my wife and what she stands for. Really just leaning back into a great reminder of why we do what we do. But I’ll tell you what I’ve been fortunate throughout my career to have some incredible challenges put in front of me. Been out of my comfort zone at times many times and that’s where a lot of growth has come. I’ve never been this far outside my comfort zone before. And like I’ve said before the thing that continues to fuel me is the time with our players in the way that they’ve responded.” On conversations with players: “To be clear I haven’t talked with every single guy on our roster; we’re still working through a few but a vast majority yes. They’ve been an open conversation an invitation for them to really share with me what they’re experiencing especially on the offensive side of the ball and just getting to know these guys — know who they are. And it has had nothing to do with football. I have not asked them any questions about anything related to before I arrived but we have put together a path of how we’re going to move forward. But most importantly just really trying to meet these guys where they’re at and make sure that there’s clear expectations of how we’re gonna move forward. “Again I think it just really comes back to meeting them where they’re at. And a lot of you know in the world that we live in it’s constantly evolving and you’re riding this roller coaster of emotion. I’m not saying that I’ve been perfect in this at all. But you’ve heard me say it many times. I’ll continue to say it: I walk into that facility or hop on a phone or even a text message. Is this supporting our players? Is this serving our players? That’s what I’m here for right now. And I tried to do my best to do just that.” On his play-calling duties: “Let me be clear if this was January we would hire a defensive coordinator immediately. Due to the context the timing of the situation and putting our defensive players at the forefront of that decision-making process I plan to call the defense. And that’s just comes from a standpoint we’ve put a great deal of effort into spring ball. I’ve been fortunate to be calling this defense for quite a long time. I want to make sure that as many people in our facility that can stay in a normal routine that we established in spring; we can keep them moving forward in that direction. It’s going to require my best in terms of creating a rhythm and a routine for fall camp and then a rhythm and a routine for the season something that I’ve never experienced. It’s going to require that I really lean on wisdom from those that have experience as head coaches to partner with me and help me navigate this. “I think if I were to identify some of my strengths as a defensive play-caller I think I’ve learned from from my mentors that you want to create a collaborative environment in the defensive staff room. In my time at North Dakota State I saw it at its best what it looks like to have a player-led football team in terms of just true investment in what you’re doing defensively and making sure that there’s dialogue investment and involvement from your players. I think I have a skill for identifying what our players do well and then really leaning into that. “What we built in the spring was very much based off of North Dakota State influence. Maybe some of the things that Coach [Mike] Hankwitz had done that our guys were very comfortable with that fit in terms of winning in the Big Ten. And then some things that I’ve mentioned that were really working for Jim O’Neil’s defense and those guys situationally that our guys are comfortable with and had recently installed. Let’s check our egos at the door; I mean what’s going to help us win football games? The evolution of that will be identifying as this team has grown over the course of the summer how we need to tweak that. “In terms of our defensive staff we do plan on bringing in a defensive assistant. We’re in a difficult situation. It’s going to take a special person that’s going to say ‘I’m going to leave my job and I’m going to run I’m going to run to the fire.’ This person better put the student-athlete as their top priority better show up and not pretend to have a bunch of answers or solutions of what we’re going through. Meet these guys where they’re at listen to them and build a quality relationship. And then be there to just make sure that our staff that’s currently in place can continue to stay in a rhythm or routine that we created over the spring.” On how he’s processed arduous times: “I thought I was running to my ultimate dream job that I hoped to be in until Fitz retired. Honestly I didn’t think I was running to the fire; I thought I was being blessed with the incredible opportunity to really fulfill a lifelong dream of coaching in the Big Ten and working for a man that prioritized the holistic development of young men and prioritized time with family. And I’ve been thrust into the fire. I’ve leaned on my faith a great deal. “And I truly believe that in my journey and our family’s journey the Lord has marked my steps from a standpoint of putting me in situations that have prepared me for this situation. And it doesn’t mean it’s easy. That doesn’t mean that I have it all figured out. I’ve admitted our players ‘Guys I will stumble along the way.’ But as long as we keep reading back into [what] I spoke of and making sure that they’re at the forefront of our priorities. I truly believe that this team is going to do great things this fall. On moving ahead without neglecting the past: “It seems like a really difficult exercise. It is. I’m open to suggestions. I think first off and foremost and I know I’m becoming repetitive but our guys just need to know that they’re supported. Yes it is absolutely critical that we prepare ourselves to go beat Rutgers. But we have no chance of doing that if our guys just don’t feel supported right now. And at some point over the course of fall camp whether that be report date or August 15 or August 24 at some point there needs to be a very clear line of ‘Guys we’ve been through a lot but it’s time to put it in the rearview mirror. It’s time to go win football games.’ And if I know anything about this group they’re looking forward to that conversation and making sure that sooner than later this group can’t get can’t wait to get back to football.” On players electing not to speak at Media Days: “It was a very open discussion but it was led by an understanding that we were going to support those young men in whatever decision they made. They were thoughtful. There was open conversation. To be honest with you there was a conversation about ‘Coach we know who we are. We know what we stand for. We can tell a story about our teammates and what we plan on doing. We want to go tell that story.’ But in a very fluid situation that was evolving I think they felt like it was in the best interest of the team to put their focus solely on preparing for fall camp.” On if he asked players about what happened during their tenures: “Anything related to pending litigation I’m staying away from.” On why no Northwestern administrators have spoken: “We have been solely focused on our players. Dr. Gragg has been incredibly supportive. He’s here today. He and I spoke at length. When the announcement was made our team found out that Coach Fitz was no longer going to be our head coach. My push number one checked on our players; number two had a staff meeting to check on our staff. We were on vacation guys. I told our staff I wanted to honor that vacation. So it was a difficult scenario to navigate. “But as many of our staff that we could get together we got together and I asked them what they needed what they really need from me and what do they need from the administration. And as I had opportunities to meet with the administration I simply asked that they work diligently with me to provide clarity for our staff. With that clarity an opportunity to then just just just go support our players. I will say that Dr. Gragg and the rest of the athletic administration have done a great job of answering those questions and providing clarity so that myself and the rest of the staff can go lead.” On if he’s had discussions about better protecting players: “Absolutely. It will be at the forefront of every decision that we have moving forward. We’ve had general conversations about that those that can be found in conversations with our university leadership. We’re still working through what many of those things are already in place. As the leader of our program I’m still working through what that looks like from a day-to-day basis. But as I referred to in my opening comments the student-athlete experience is what this is all about and we need to make sure that the way that we operate is ensuring that that is an experience that our guys chose to come to Northwestern for. That’s the best of both worlds. That’s a world-class education it’s playing on the biggest stage of college football and it’s creating memories with your teammates that last a lifetime.” On his coaching mentors: “Matt Entz head coach at North Dakota State. I keep talking about the student-athlete experience and that’s Matt Entz to a T. He’s someone I will continue to lean on. That man taught me what it looked like to be a detail-oriented coach that was passionate about the game. Uncommon work ethic pushed his players to be the absolute best while absolutely loving on them every second of the way and also embodied what it looked like to be a great husband and a great father. So yeah Matt Entz all day.” On if he considered not attending Media Days: “There were some jokes about if Kristin can go into labor roughly about 8 a.m. this morning But absolutely not. If I’m going to ask our players to stare this thing down and take on this adversity and come together it was absolutely critical that I showed up and stared this down and started to pave a roadmap for how we’re going to move forward. “ On preparing for today: “I’ve been so busy with so many other things. I don’t know if the full gravity of that hit me until last night. I’m very thankful for a lot of people praying for me right now. And I’m thankful for that. I’m thankful for the maturing process I’ve gone through over the course of the last five years of truly understanding what matters and who I truly answer to. This is something over the course of the last 24 hours that I just wanted to make sure that my words were certainly empathizing with anyone that’s gone through something and has been a victim of hazing is in full support of our team our staff and those that are at our facility; make sure that my words come across in a way of understanding how honored I am to have an opportunity to walk alongside our team as we as we go through this. My wife told me ‘go be you just be yourself.’ That is the best advice anyone could ask for.” On if staffers named in allegations still have credibility: “I won’t comment on anything that is alleged. I’m confident in the fact that our university has procedures in place to do what they need to do to see facts and make decisions based off the facts. To answer your follow-up question since I arrived on Jan. 16 of this year I have seen nothing but a coaching staff and the two names that you mentioned [MacPherson and Hooten] are guys that have rallied around our players and been there for them. Speaking on my experiences I have full confidence in the men that are in that facility right now.” On having a pulse on his locker room: “It’s a great question. Number one it’s making sure that there’s perfect alignment from our university leadership athletic administration myself and then our entire staff down to our players to understand that those expectations are there. Then just being fiercely intentional about making sure that I’m observing everything taking everything in and making sure that what we’re doing as a football program as a university is what we’ve promised to do. “The more time that we can spend with them: at meals in the weight room walking around the facility. I mean how do you build trust? How do you develop culture? It’s time it’s getting to know one another. So if that’s one less hour of film for me in the prep maybe someone else has to pick up that slack. But the more that I can deal with our players the better off we’re going to be.” On if he’s seen any form of hazing at Northwestern: “Absolutely not.” On if he’s read allegations that surfaced: “I have not. I read the executive summary. There’s things that have been brought to my attention that [I] absolutely had to know. But again for me to continue to look at my phone and see exactly what’s breaking I’m trusting our administrators and the support around me to bring things to my attention that I need to know about and pour in every other ounce of my energy into the people in our facility — most specifically our players.” On if he’s talked to Fitzgerald since becoming head coach: “Those conversations are private. What I can say is Coach Fitz has a son on the team and I have tried to be very intentional about making sure that I’m connecting with the parents of the young men on our team. I can also state that I’ve been charged with leading this program moving forward and I’m making those decisions based on being in the building and having our student-athletes at the forefront of what’s guiding those decisions. Coach Fitz is someone that there was a long-standing relationship with and someone that I plan on having as a friend for for a long time.” On if he feels supported by the administration: “Absolutely. In terms of a roster we have quite the task at hand. We essentially have been thrust into a situation where we are recruiting our entire team until this transfer portal window opens. I feel very confident saying that any questions that I’ve had in navigating that the administration has been very supportive.” On maintaining high school recruiting: “The best thing we can do right now is just go put on full display of what this place is all about and go win a bunch of football games. I trust when we do that those guys are going to realize that Northwestern is still a great option for them moving forward.” On having only three players transfer so far: “It speaks to the character of the young men that had been recruited here. It speaks to the leadership in this locker room. Honestly it speaks to our strength and conditioning staff. Those are the men that have had the most direct interaction with those guys on a consistent basis for morning workouts moving forward. There’s some stuff that I’ve had to push through. That’s difficult but I view that as a means to making sure that we get to fall camp and this season and let our guys go write their story. But when you’re around our guys right now and you’re in the weight room you’re in a one-on-one meeting with them it’s contagious. It’s a special group.” On delegating responsibility: “Just because I have ‘interim head coach’ next to my name doesn’t mean that it’s my responsibility to micromanage everything within our program. It’s trusting Mike Bajakian; it’s trusting our offensive staff. I’ll let them make those decisions. I’m going to just keep getting to know those guys and making sure that I feel like I got a pulse of this football team.” On what’s been most difficult: “Honestly I have a tendency to be a people-pleaser. I’ve gotten way better at that. But still that’s kind of my natural fabric and I can be pretty self-critical. So there’s some times that I’m letting my boys down right now I’m not at their baseball game or I’m not home in time to help Kristin around the house. When it comes to being a people-pleaser you realize as you become a defensive coordinator there’s more people that report to you; there’s more people that are waiting on your decisions. “You can’t please everyone; you’ve just got to do what you believe is in the best interest of the group. You thought that was gravity; now all of a sudden you’re sitting in the role as a head coach and you better just have your convictions and stay true to who you are. Then just be willing when you make a decision that you recognize it was a bad decision you’re willing to pivot quickly. But those are two things that I’m really wrestling with on a daily basis.” On President Michael Schill’s decision to fire Fitzgerald: “The decisions of President Schill are things that I won’t comment on and to be honest with you I feel like are really not in my lane. I don’t plan on getting out of my lane any time soon.” On what will improve Northwestern’s negative perception: “Put our players on full display. They will change that conversation and that narrative. Anyone that has had an opportunity to meet the young men that are part of Northwestern football would know they’re men of character integrity toughness grit highly intellectual selfless individuals that are awesome to coach.” On talking to transfers about their feelings: “Honestly it’s the same conversation that we’ve had with everyone on that roster. I know it’s more fresh; no different than with our current freshmen. But I would venture to say that a majority of our roster one of the determining factors in them coming to Northwestern was the opportunity to pay play for Coach Fitz. So there’s going to be some natural ‘Why am I still here if he’s not?’ Those are hard conversations.” On quantifying the number of players who are frustrated: “I did not put a number on thoughts of who may or may not leave. In reference to some of the things that our guys are are experiencing I don’t want to speak for the young men within our program. I think each has had a very unique experience. I can say with conviction that there is many individuals that that wish that Coach Fitz was still their head coach. But everyone’s had their own unique experience. Again I think that’s where it’s so critical that I just continue to find ways to do my best to meet these guys where they’re at as individuals. That’s where one-on-one meetings are just so critical in all this.” On if he ever considered not accepting the interim job: “Absolutely not. I hope I’ve been raised in a way that I’m the guy that people can count on. I’ll stand in the fire with them; I’ll run to the fire. I hope when I look back on this 20 years from now I’m proud of the way that we went about this.” On instilling a new culture: “Especially considering our current situation and the timeliness of it I think it’s my role to really observe who we are. Not to say ‘This is what is said on a PowerPoint or this is what hangs on the walls’ but what do our actions show? What do we want our actions to show? And then really start to create a conversation of what that looks like and how we can make sure that that shows up on a consistent basis.” On recruiting: “That is an incredible challenge right now just from a standpoint of of all the moving pieces that’s going on right now. The first thing I would say is the best thing we can do is focus on the people that are currently in that facility and find a way to go win a bunch of football games while making sure that we ensure that our players know that if a recruit walked in they’d say “Hey Joe Smith or whoever telling you that this this place is special you’re going to get one of the best educations you can find you’re going to be playing Big Ten football. We’ve been through a lot but there’s something special brewing here.’ “We move forward; we may not be able to chase after the high-end four star. We just need to find guys that fit us. Guys that are developmental that want to be developed and pushed. That we have a view of not who they are today — who they can be 36 months from now. Get those guys in the program and say ‘Three years from now watch out.’ So it’ll be a unique recruiting cycle. But I’m confident in our recruiting staff and the conversations they’ve started to have on how we’re going to navigate them moving forward.” On ensuring that Northwestern is a safe place: “I’ll refer back to my opening opening comments. At the forefront of my mind is going to be the student-athlete experience. Hazing has no place in that.” On the Big Ten’s new TV deal: “I have no idea. That’s something I’m still learning.” On helping players handle updates with allegations: “I think it comes down to just continuing to control what I can control and then show up to that building every day or wherever we’re together and just bringing the energy into that room. That whatever is put in front of us today we’re going to navigate this together. Struggles with anxiety that are certainly real are things that we’re fearful of the future. Well the best way that we can control that is just put ourselves in the present. I’m gonna do my best to make sure I’m modeling that for our student-athletes.” On when his wife is due: “Literally her due date is our report date to camp. We’ll be going in Friday morning and hope to have a new baby girl some time this weekend so very soon.” On his control of the program: “To think that you’re going to have full control over 100 adolescent young men or for that matter an entire program and all the pieces that go into that isn’t realistic. You’ve got to lean into making sure that you feel like you’re populating your organization with the right people. That’s going to be part of the biggest learning curve that I go through What does that really look like? And how can I make sure that the student athlete experience I keep referring back to that everything is pointed towards that. But it will be an incredible challenge one that I’ll have to seek a great deal of experience and wisdom from others for.  On if expectations for 2023 have changed: “If our players were sitting here — I stand with our players on this — they would say that the standards and expectations have not changed. And that’s to win a Big Ten West championship show back up in Indy and go win a bowl game.” On what the Northwestern administration has done to make him feel supported: “Be willing to meet answer phone calls take text messages and listen.” On injury updates before training camp: “I can say as an entire roster I feel really good about where we’re at with the health of our football team. We’re excited to lean into the depth on this football team moving forward.”  On construction of Ryan Field: “To be very frank with you that has not been something that’s even even crossed my mind. I fully trust those in charge of making that happen are taking all the proper steps to make sure we keep more moving forward and continue to keep that as a piece of what is critical to Northwestern football for the future.” On if he’s talked to Pat Ryan yet: “I have not. Looking forward to that opportunity.” On A.J. Henning: “We’ve got to find ways to allow that young man to touch the football whether that’s on special teams on the offensive side of the ball. I’m really excited about the depth in that wide receiver room. I think we’re gonna really be able to do I am extremely confident in Mike’s [Bajakian’s] ability to find ways to get the ball in our playmakers’ hands through quick game through screens through RPOs and finding ways to put guys like A.J. in different spots on the field so people can’t track him. I’m excited about where this offense is at. We plan on A.J. being a big part of that.” On what he wants to see from quarterbacks: “I want to see these guys compete and lead which which they’ve shown. Something that I really took from my time at North Dakota State I wasn’t there while Carson [Wentz] was playing but I’ve met Carson been around him when he’s come back. I’ve had a chance to be around Easton Stick a great deal. Trey Lance is one of my favorites of all time just in terms of who he is what he stands for and what he’s meant to myself and my family. Cam Miller has had one heck of a career up there so far. “The thing that I’ve learned about just being around that group is so much of their success has nothing to do with their arm talent or their footwork or all those tangible things that we like to dissect. What made all of those guys great in their own way through their own unique personality was their willingness to stand out in the arena with courage and go lead. And that’s what I want to see out of that room. I’m confident that room is full of those types of young men.” On the benefits of coming from an outside program: “Northwestern football under Coach Fitz reached incredible heights and created incredible sustainability and stability. There’s so many things that we’ll continue to evaluate. I think the narrative that sometimes happens and this happened for me — and it frustrates me to be honest with you — is people say ‘Well it’s your defense talk to me about your defense.’ It’s not my defense; it’s our defense. It’s our staff’s defense our players are all a critical part of this. So for there to be this thought that ‘Well I need to step in and make it mine’ that couldn’t be further from the truth. “We have an incredible opportunity to evaluate everything and again identify what this team does well; where there’s some potential holes and limitations how we can cover those up and how we find ways to win games this season. Nothing more frustrating and it happened at North Dakota State. But ‘Why do we do it this way?’ Well that’s how we’ve always done it. And we’ve won this many national championships do in that way.’ But if you can’t give a direct reason. Matt Entz he was great about saying ‘That’s not a good enough answer.’ Well the same should apply here. If there’s a great reason why we’re doing it that way awesome let’s keep it consistent. But if we don’t have a great reason for it or we feel like it’s time to evolve tweak and change then we better be willing to do it. Again coming back to my tendencies of being a people pleaser I gotta guard against that. Because if there’s a bunch of people looking at me saying ‘We’re not comfortable with that’ I’ve got to be willing to say ‘I think it’s in the best interest of this football team for right now to do it this way.’ And that can be a really difficult conversation and will be one of my greatest challenges.” On if allegations have affected his perception of Northwestern’s players: “Not one bit. I can only refer back to my experiences I’ve had since since January of this year. I was so fortunate to be around a group of men at North Dakota State that were just an incredible group that I loved to coach. To even have the ability to compare this group to that group the love and admiration that I have for those guys up in Fargo I put this group right along with it. “I’ve only been with them for a few months. But it hasn’t changed one thing. If anything it’s just really solidified everything they’ve gone through in the time I’ve spent with them how special this group is. I can’t speak to what happened prior to my arrival; I can only speak to my experiences and everything I’ve experienced gives me great conviction that that I’m rolling with a group that will take this thing head on and come together to do something really special.” On having five total new Northwestern coaches: “I think it’s an opportunity for us to all recognize that there’s certain things that we don’t know. Then that’s where we lean on people that have been around Northwestern for a long time whether that be on campus whether that be within other components of the athletic department the administration. We just talked about an opportunity for us to evaluate everything and make decisions that we know are in the best interest of our student-athletes. “But I can tell you this: we’re going to make sure we do everything in our power to keep our our student-athletes routine and rhythm intact as much as we can as long as there’s reason that aligns with how we’re moving forward because of the timing of this situation. We are on the cusp of fall camp starting and again I’ll keep coming back to it. If we’re saying it’s their interest that that we’re putting at the forefront we have to consider that in every decision that we make.” On praising Fitzgerald despite allegations: “I don’t know what transpired so I can’t speak to that. I’ve admired Coach Fitz for a long time in everything that I’ve experienced since I arrived on Jan. 16 of this year aligned with everything I believed him to be. What you see is what you get. He’s a man that stood for the holistic development of young men and prioritizes family — things that I admire and look up to.”  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story With the season opener a month away it’s time for Northwestern field hockey to begin its quest to a second national title and avenge last year’s championship loss. To start coverage of the year ahead let’s start with the Tracey Fuchs’ newest Wildcats.  Transfers M Lindsey Frank graduate student (Richmond) A dual-athlete standout Frank is joining arguably not just two of Northwestern’s best teams but also the best programs for each sport in lacrosse and field hockey.  In addition to leading her lacrosse team in goals for the past three seasons she also paced the Richmond field hockey team in goals and assists for the past two seasons. That’s pretty notable considering Frank sat out her sophomore season due to the pandemic plus opted to play lacrosse in spring 2021 instead. Over her playing career for the Spiders Frank has started all but one game which came in her first season. The two-time Atlantic 10 All-Conference player has the potential to be a solid player for Fuchs as she joins last year’s No. 2 team from the No. 56. And yeah she also has the potential to be a solid player for Kelly Amonte Hiller. Get excited to see Frank in the fall and keep that excitement up for the spring. First-Years F/M Olivia Bent-Cole As the MAX Field Hockey 2022 National Player of the Year and First Team All-American Bent-Cole is one of the best players in her class. The Philadelphia native had 38 goals and 16 assists last season contributing to her career 138 goals and 48 assists. Adding on to a remarkable senior year Bent-Cole led Camden Catholic the No. 1 team according to MAX Field Hockey to its first state championship in 37 years. A member of the U.S. Women’s National Team Bent-Cole has international playing experience from the FIH Pro League. This past spring she scored two goals while playing in the Junior Pan American Championships.  M Emilie Kirschner  Adding a player from Chapel Hill could be a good omen for the ‘Cats as they have come to face North Carolina in back-to-back NCAA tournament appearances — including last year’s title game. The Second-Team All-American helped deliver the Hill School which MAX Field Hockey ranked as the second best program in the country in 2022 its first title in her senior season. F/M Piper Borz Borz was a standout player for her high school McDonough leading it to the conference semifinals and also being recognized as one of the best players in the Baltimore metropolitan area by the Baltimore Sun. Over her last two seasons she compiled 32 goals and 16 assists and was invited to U.S. National Team U18 selection camp. The All-Conference Track and Field member will be expected to bring identifiable speed to the Wildcats. F/M Ella Kokinis The Baltimore native was another player recognized by the Baltimore Sun as one of the best in the region. The Third-Team All-American excelled on offense finishing her senior season with 22 goals and 13 assists. Kokinis helped lead her team Garrison Forest to a conference championship which included a five-goal game in the conference semifinals.  GK Faye Post Fuchs adds a much-needed goalkeeper for the coming years in Post. With Annabel Skubisz and Jamie Marold heading into their senior seasons it’ll be valuable to have Post learn from veteran players as she likely steps into the goal next season. As a senior Post had a 98.3% save percentage encompassing 11 shutouts and 173 saves. M/B Ilse Tromp The Netherlands native has a plethora of top-tier playing experience. Tromp played 12 years for HC Rotterdam before going the Hoofdklasse team the highest division of Field Hockey in the Netherlands where she was part of four championships.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Given everything that has happened in the past three weeks it’s admittedly difficult to think about Northwestern football right now. However with just over five weeks remaining before NU heads east the depth chart is beginning to shape up — and there are still many questions across the roster that could linger all the way until Sept. 3. So we’ll begin our annual series of previewing each position group on the team starting with the quarterbacks. Overview: Returning starters: Ryan Hilinski (Sr.) Brendan Sullivan (Jr.) Cole Freeman (Jr.) Key losses: Carl Richardson (Transfer to UW-Platteville) Returners: Jack Lausch (So.) Newcomers: Ben Bryant (Sr.) Aidan Gray (Fy.) Northwestern’s 2022 quarterback room was one for the books — not in a good way. A handful of passers got the starting nod en route to an infamous 1-11 record. Ryan Hilinski started the season under center nabbing a win against Nebraska in a showing that left many cautiously optimistic that the former South Carolina Gamecock had found his rhythm in Evanston. It didn’t take long for those aspirations to prove lofty as Hilinski went on to boast a 4-to-7 touchdown-to-interception ratio in his remaining appearances. Former head coach Pat Fitzgerald tried out a duo of sophomores Brendan Sullivan and Cole Freeman. Sullivan flexed the strongest statline — “strongest” being a relative term — thanks to a 73.9% completion rate and a (barely) positive TD-to-INT ratio. Freeman tallied zero touchdowns and nine turnovers. Needless to say a reformation within NU’s football program — albeit for matters far more serious than quarterback production — might be able to kickstart a new era within the position room. The ‘Cats landed a big-time transfer in former Cincinnati QB Ben Bryant. Bryant against decently impressive competition notched a statline vastly more desirable than anything any of the Northwestern slingers accomplished. Amidst the school administration’s attempt to purge the program of toxicity that The Athletic reported dates back decades Bryant’s lack of affiliation with the Wildcats could prove to advantage the team. Key Player: Ben Bryant By Northwestern standards Bryant dominated at Cincy last season. He passed for 21 touchdowns and seven interceptions adding over 2700 yards in the air. To his credit he also only lost one fumble all year. Bryant is far from a flawless quarterback. He initially hoped to declare for the NFL Draft after his recent campaign but a late-season foot injury spoiled his chances to sneak into Day 3. Now he heads into a fight for the starting spot. To secure his spot under center Bryant needs to improve his footwork. In the face of pressure he throws off balance or on his back foot way too much resulting in errant throws and unnecessary interceptions. It’s also a well diagnosed issue that Bryant doesn’t make his reads consistently too often selecting a receiver before the snap to pass to. Looking ahead to the 2023 season assuming Bryant beats out Sullivan in camp the super senior will have one more chance to prove to NFL teams that he’s worth a draft pick. That bodes well for David Braun and Co. who can surely get behind any sort of motivation at this point. Bryant’s arm strength and red zone proficiency looks to bolster an ailing position group. Big Question: Can Ben Bryant steady the ship? In the last 12 months five quarterbacks touched the field for the ‘Cats a head coach was axed and to mark the instability as resolved would be grossly presumptuous. It’s well documented that the quarterback is the face of a team. To rebuild a program and its culture will be impossible without a steady hand leading on the field.  Enter: Ben Bryant? Hopefully he can turn that question mark into a period affirming his presence as a winner — on and off the field. No one expects a football team fresh off a 1-11 year and a coaching change to excel. To be a “winner” Bryant doesn’t need to take NU to a bowl game; he doesn’t even have to tally a winning record. He simply needs to be good enough to justify him starting without question in every game of the season. That might be an out-of-touch goal but if the Illinois native can remove concern about who’ll be taking snaps on Saturday Braun and fans alike will bask in a change from 2022.  Bryant has an early lead on the competition seasoned on the collegiate level with stats to back it up. All he needs to do is continue to make small improvements stay healthy foster a positive culture and show up when it matters.

Share this story Is the Women’s World Cup not giving you enough of your women’s soccer fix? Not very surprising given that Northwestern women’s soccer is the true pinnacle of the sport and it has been too long without it. However wait no longer because the ‘Cats’ season is just around the corner and Inside NU has you covered.  Northwestern’s first game kicks off on August 17 at Marquette and with it comes a whole new crop of Wildcats. Let’s meet them before they grace the pitch this fall. Gina Muzi GK Last season a large part of the Wildcats’ success came from their grad transfer goalie Mia Raben. This year they’ll be looking to follow that same blueprint bringing in graduate transfer Gina Muzi from St. John’s University. Muzi started 19 games for the Red Storm making 42 saves while allowing 16 goals. The fifth-year will likely compete against rising sophomore Reiley Fitzpatrick for the starting job. Maddie Finnerty M The Wildcats’ midfield was prolific last year with Josie Aulicino and Caterina Regazzoni leading the way and first-year Maddie Finnerty will look to add to that group’s production. Hailing from San Clemente Cal. Finnerty joins Northwestern after completing her first season in over three years. The SoCal Blues club player suffered ACL tears in both her sophomore and junior years of high school but she returned for her senior year to help San Clemente to a 14-3-6 record and reach the CIF-SS quarter finals. Presley Nevadomsky M Northwestern looks to continue bolstering its midfield with the addition of first-year Presley Nevadomsky out of La Canada Cal. In 17 games for Flintridge Prep as a senior Nevadomsky scored 13 goals and notched 5 assists. This production is reminiscent of numbers put up by the Wildcats’ midfielders last season so the Los Angeles SC player should fit in well. Nevadomsky and Finnerty both will look to fill the gaps left behind by the likes of Rowan Lapi and Lily Gilbertson as the newcomers look to become regular members of Northwestern’s dynamic midfield. Megan Norkett F Norkett comes to Northwestern from nearby Naperville with quite the resume in tow. In three years at Naperville Central Norkett racked up 47 goals and 33 assists to go along with three All-State and two Gatorade Player of the Year finalist honors. Her ability to score and facilitate could prove impactful for the Wildcats in an already impressive offense. Keira Wagner D Wagner keeps Northwestern’s west coast connection strong hailing from Redondo Beach California. The defender comes into a loaded back line but she’ll be able to learn from the likes of Danika Austin and Emma Phillips during her first year in Evanston. Holland Carey M Carey is trading the dry heat of Scottsdale Arizona for the lakeshores of Evanston where she’ll join a stacked midfield unit. Carey ran track and cross country in high school so her speed can be a major contribution on the pitch. C.J. Roy GK Roy has four years of starting experience under her belt but she will likely slot in at third on the goalie depth chart behind Fitzpatrick and Muzi once at Northwestern. A dual-sport athlete in high school Roy accumulated accolades earning Second Team All-Met three years in a row for soccer and winning Gatorade Player of the Year twice for softball. Sarah O’Donnell M O’Donnell out of Ashburn Virginia is the final first-year joining the midfield group. She will provide depth for some of the hardest working positions on the team and look to maximize her playing time come fall. Jennie Clark Assistant Coach The field won’t be the only spot where new ‘Cats will be residing with Jennie Clark joining head coach Michael Moynihan on the touchline as an assistant coach. Clark will be returning to the Big Ten a conference she knows well thanks to her four seasons on the field as a Minnesota Golden Gopher. Since her time in Minneapolis the former defender made her way through professional soccer playing in Women’s Professional Soccer in the US and the Frauen-Bundesliga in Germany. Since transitioning to coaching Clark has worked with Utah Tech in the collegiate ranks and Minnesota Aurora FC in the USL W League. Clark will look to bring her defensive experience to improve an already impressive backline that only allowed 18 goals last season. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Author’s note: For this piece I spoke to three lawyers with experience in negotiating college coaching contracts. Two asked to remain anonymous out of caution that they could be used as expert witnesses in a potential trial. The third is Attorney Martin J. Greenberg who negotiated former Northwestern head coach Randy Walker’s contract. Shortly after being fired on July 10 former Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald announced in a statement that he hired Dan Webb from Winston and Strawn LLP to “take the necessary steps to protect [his] rights in accordance with the law.” In the weeks since Fitzgerald has been named a defendant in a lawsuit by a former student-athlete who says Fitzgerald was negligent in allowing hazing to occur. The lawsuit also alleges Fitzgerald who maintains he had no knowledge of any hazing within the program “took part in the harassment hazing bullying assault and/or abuse of athletes.”  Northwestern is now facing at least five lawsuits from former football players and although those legal situations are complex and warrant their own deep dive the primary focus of this piece is to break down Pat Fitzgerald’s current legal situation and his own potential lawsuit against the school. Why did Fitzgerald decide to hire legal counseling? The move to hire Dan Webb is no small headline. Webb served as the Special Counsel in the Iran-Contra affair where he successfully prosecuted John Poindexter Ronald Reagan’s National Security Advisor for lying to Congress. Webb has represented Bill Gates and Microsoft in United States v. Microsoft Corporation and Fox News in Dominion v. Fox News Network as well as securing convictions against Jussie Smollett as the special prosecutor. According to Attorney Martin J. Greenberg when a coach and university divorce without mutual agreement there are four key ways it can happen: The first two are relatively straightforward. In the third when a coach is terminated without cause usually for poor performance the university is still liable to pay the remaining amount on the contract and is usually attached to lucrative buyout numbers.  The Fitzgerald case falls under the fourth category termination with cause which according to Greenberg is a growing trend in college sports as it does not require the university to reward the coach with their remaining salary.  Fitzgerald reportedly signed a 10-year $57 million contract extension in 2021 that would have kept him in Evanston through 2030. With roughly $42 million yet to be earned on the deal Fitzgerald swiftly moved to lawyer up and explore legal options. Webb has stipulated that Fitzgerald’s firing was a breach of contract with significant damage to the coach’s reputation. What does the language of the contract look like? Because Northwestern is a private university it does not need to abide by Freedom of Information Act requests which means that unlike many other coaching contracts the details of Fitzgerald’s deal with Northwestern remain unavailable to the public. For that reason the most crucial pieces of information lie only in the hands of Fitzgerald his legal team and the university. The key to the entire puzzle is what vocabulary the contract constitutes is “for cause” in that fourth category that Fitzgerald’s exit falls under. According to several lawyers I spoke to what “for cause” looks like in the due process clauses of a coaching agreement varies from contract to contract. Of course criminal activity and breaches of that nature would qualify as reasons for termination at any school but the minutia can differ depending on a variety of factors. One lawyer explained that private and public universities will often have different provisions and that at an academically prestigious school such as Northwestern there may be emphasized bylaws about behavior that inhibits student-athletes from benefitting from their academic experience. Faith-based institutions and military schools also have key distinctions from typical coaching contracts. All this to say each contract is unique and Fitzgerald’s is no different. Additionally one lawyer would not say for sure but mentioned they would not be surprised if over several contract extensions as the coach built up goodwill and accolades the specific language in Fitzgerald’s deal became more lenient over time. When it comes to making the decision to let a coach go for cause Greenberg explained that the university president usually becomes the “judge and jury” in the case. When he negotiated a contract on behalf of Walker who preceded Fitzgerald at Northwestern he fought to have the decision for what “for cause” is be handled by a panel of arbitrators rather than the president. He estimated that this was one of the first instances in the history of college coaching that language like this was used in a contract. However this type of clause which was negotiated for eight months has not become standard procedure in the two-plus decades since. ""With so much money at stake Greenberg said that he tells his law classes at Marquette University that “when negotiating and drafting coaches contracts the back end is more important than the front end. In other words the termination provisions are more important than how much you get paid.”"" What strategy might Fitzgerald’s legal team pursue? In the scenario where Fitzgerald and Northwestern do not agree to a settlement and this case goes to trial Webb’s team has already begun showing legal strategy. Clearly a main bullet point is that Fitzgerald was unaware of the hazing in his program and as a result was fired without justifiable motive. All of the lawyers I spoke to mentioned that the original punishment for Fitzgerald being a two-week suspension will definitely be used in his favor. One of the major questions remains: in the weekend between issuing the short suspension and the decision to sever ties completely what changed? Did new information come to light or was it just public scrutiny and pressure? Webb will likely pursue a line of argument that states that at one point by deciding to suspend Fitzgerald rather than any stronger punishment the university itself clearly determined that Fitzgerald’s actions were not severe enough to warrant termination for cause. One lawyer also mentioned that in a case like this with an outside investigation it can be difficult to get testimonials from current and former players and staff members because of the friendly relationship so many still have with Fitzgerald. As a result Webb and his team may have more access to certain information than the university allowing them to build a case of strong testimonials of people who were close with Fitzgerald and knew him for decades. What about the other side of the case? For the university without knowing the exact language of the contract it is hard to speculate but one major aspect is NCAA Bylaw 11.1.2.1 which states: It shall be the responsibility of an institution’s head coach to promote an atmosphere for compliance within the program supervised by the coach and to monitor the activities regarding compliance of all assistant coaches and other administrators involved with the program who report directly or indirectly to the coach. The bylaw later states “a head coach is presumed to have knowledge of what is occurring in his program and therefore can be responsible for the actions of his staff and individuals associated with the program.” This bylaw promotes the doctrine of vicarious liability which places the responsibility of assistants and their actions under the scope of the head coach. If it can be proven that assistant coaches under Fitzgerald knew about the hazing Webb’s argument that Fitzgerald was unaware and therefore immune to any punishment is effectively nullified. Under this bylaw Fitzgerald would have committed a Level I Violation labeled as “Severe Breach of Conduct.” According to the legislation this could lead to penalties in the form of a postseason ban financial sanctions scholarship reductions recruiting restrictions on official and unofficial visits or complete probation.  In other major college football coaching contracts such as Dabo Swinney’s at Clemson there is a subclause within the section that outlines the coach’s duties requiring him to refrain from “any act or omission (including but not limited to physical and/or emotional abuse of student athletes) that creates or could reasonably be expected to create an unreasonable risk of harm to a student athlete.” This type of clause from Swinney’s deal signed in 2019 is believed to be among the first of its type in a coaching contract. This would mean that any hazing scandal like the one at Northwestern would be an automatic cause for termination. Although it is a new occurrence in the chance that Fitzgerald’s new contract featured any language reminiscent of that in Swinney’s Fitzgerald and Webb’s claims would be baseless. What are some similar examples of termination in college sports? One of the most recent examples of firing with cause in college sports may be the best comparison to this case as it also involves hazing. The New Mexico State men’s basketball program canceled the remainder of its season this past February after two players filed a police report detailing hazing and assault. Coach Greg Heiar was subsequently terminated. In June the players who filed the report settled their lawsuit with the school with New Mexico State agreeing to pay $8 million to Deuce Benjamin and Shak Odunewu. Four months after being fired by NMSU Heiar was recently hired to be the head coach at Mineral Area College a junior college in Missouri. In 2021 Washington State football coach Nick Rolovich was fired with just cause for refusing to comply with the state’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for state employees. Although the circumstances of the termination are vastly different Rolovich similarly appealed the decision claiming he was wrongfully terminated. With roughly $4 million remaining on his contract Rolovich pressed charges citing faith-based reasons for his unwillingness to receive the vaccine. This spring a judge dismissed parts of his lawsuit but his claims against Washington State were allowed to proceed toward trial and are worth monitoring as another data point in determining what Fitzgerald’s outcome may be. Another similar case can be found in former Kansas football coach David Beaty. Beaty was originally fired without cause with Kansas agreeing to pay the coach the remaining $3 million owed. Beaty was later informed that he was under investigation for misconduct for the use of a non-coaching staff member in a coaching role putting him in violation of the aforementioned NCAA Bylaw 11.1.2.1. As a result the status of Beaty’s termination was switched from “without cause” to “with cause.” In 2019 Beaty sued the university for breach of contract claiming Kansas was using the investigation to avoid paying him the remaining amount in his deal. A year later the two parties reached a $2.55 million settlement. Tennessee football coach Jeremy Pruitt Texas basketball coach Chris Beard St. John’s basketball coach Mike Anderson and LSU basketball coach Will Wade are among the other coaches fired with cause in just the past two years a list that continues to grow. What is the most likely outcome? Ultimately the lawyers I spoke to did not want to speculate too much because of the unknowns in Fitzgerald’s contract language but most believed a settlement might make sense for both sides. The Fitzgerald side has the incentive to wrap up this process sooner rather than later so he can know his eligibility as a coach for future jobs and potentially enter his name into the coaching carousel for the 2024 season. On top of that Fitzgerald may want to avoid trial where the university — with all of its resources — would be able to build a case against him. The university and conference have an additional incentive to iron this out before the 2024 season as well. With UCLA and USC set to join the Big Ten and the prestige that comes alongside the shiny new TV deal it is a poor look to have one school engaged in an active investigation and pending lawsuit. Additionally universities have additional motives to remove the lingering scandal. Take Wichita State for example where former basketball coach Gregg Marshall resigned in the wake of an investigation into his abusive behavior. As explained by Alex Utrup when breaking down why Wichita State agreed to a $7.75 million settlement rather than going to court “A trial involving whether a coach was properly terminated for cause is always high profile constantly being dissected and discussed by the media and fans and may have an ultimate effect on the college in terms of recruiting donations from alumni and impede the general functionality of the athletics department and the program. Also there is the time factor. Rather than focusing on the raising money from alumni putting winning teams on the playing field athletics departments are forced to use their resources for a drawn out expensive and intense legal battle.” However one lawyer I talked to pointed out that depending on what is uncovered in the former student-athletes’ lawsuits against Fitzgerald it could reach a point where the university can no longer settle. If the information released in those cases which is likely to move faster than a potential Fitzgerald lawsuit against the school is incredibly damming the PR and logistics of a settlement could look so bad for Northwestern that it is no longer a reasonable outcome. Fitzgerald also needs to be careful with his options to avoid receiving an NCAA show-cause penalty which could dissuade other programs from hiring him for the foreseeable future. The show-cause penalty the most serious penalty a coach can receive can be given to any coach found to have committed major rules violations and is intended to prevent coaches from escaping their punishments by taking a job at an unpenalized school. According to lawyers if the two parties who both have some incentive to do so can agree to a settlement the figure is likely to be far less than the reported $42 million remaining on Fitzgerald’s deal. Regarding the timeline for an outcome a settlement could accelerate the process but lawyers agreed that the complexity of this situation in addition to the other lawsuits could extend this affair for a while. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But in 2023 the Incredible Hull will be suiting up in blue and white for the Indianapolis Colts having achieved his NFL dream. His absence creates a gaping hole for NU to plug. Hull was the team’s most productive skill-position player by a country mile and a consistent leader even at the end of a nightmarish 1-11 season.  His 55 receptions trailed only number-one wideout Malik Washington (by just 10) and his 221 carries accounted for 47% of all touches for Wildcat rushers and were the fifth most carries in the entire Big Ten. Cam Porter saw the next most action for the ‘Cats with just 87 touches on the ground. Hull’s 4.1 yards per carry led the team by almost a full yard.  As Hull looks to find similar success with the Colts (and it’s looking like his role might increase if a certain superstar running back’s trade request is granted) NU will look for others to step up. Without any established wideouts and with a questionable quarterback room the program needs one of these running backs to emerge as an offensive threat and a team leader in 2023. All four of these backs have been with the program for at least a season but none of them jump off the page as obvious heirs to Hull. All eyes will be on Porter but it’s hard to predict how productive the senior is really capable of being. Meanwhile Anthony Tyus III and Joseph Himon II saw minimal action last season and Caleb Komolafe didn’t play at all. Key Player: Cam Porter Porter was a frustrating watch at times in 2022. He amassed 286 yards and two touchdowns in his junior season earning just 3.3 yards per attempt. The 220-pound bruiser showed the ability to run defenders over and that was exciting but it also felt like he ran himself into trouble more often than not. With that being said some of the negative energy surrounding Porter from Wildcat fans stemmed from the fact that him being on the field often meant Hull was sitting down.  The ‘Cats hope Porter has made strides this offseason as he will take over as the lead back. Consistent reps also may help; his usage last season was sporadic and likely made it difficult to get into a rhythm. To be clear Porter doesn’t have to be Hull. Hopefully he will get some help carrying the load from others in the room. But he has to be more productive than he was last season. Otherwise it’s going to be a long year watching a Skoronski-less Hull-less rushing attack try to establish the run. Big Question: Will Tyus III or Himon II have an impact? Both of these guys saw the field for Northwestern in 2022 but neither was all that relevant. With Porter as the starter someone needs to slot into that second running back role he occupied last season.  Tyus III a former three-star recruit entering his junior season seems like the more likely candidate. The power-back has a year of experience on Himon who saw just four carries last year as a freshman. Tyus’s 2.9 yards per carry last year is a little disconcerting but with a sample size of 19 attempts it’s probably not worth taking stock in. It’s hard to know what 2023 will bring for him but he should get the opportunity to dramatically increase his role in the Northwestern offense.

Share this story Northwestern field hockey’s first exhibition game against Michigan State is now exactly two weeks away! We already started previewing the roster by dissecting the NCAA finalists’ newcomers on Friday; now it’s time to look at some of the returning contributors who either played as reserves in 2022 or will take on significantly larger roles in 2023. It’s worth noting that the criteria for this is very subjective — this will include returning players who started fewer than 20 games for the ‘Cats in 2022 which means there are a few returning starters here who may have missed some time last fall. Probable 2023 starters M Chloe Relford (SR) The rising senior played in every single game in 2022 and she started in 10 of them. Relford took on huge minutes down the stretch even playing the full 60 against UNC in the national title. Given Relford played at her best in the clutch that growing role made sense; she buried an empty-net insurance goal late in the Final Four against Maryland which sent Northwestern to its second straight national title game. Although Bente Baekers is gone NU will return most of its midfield. That leaves a ton of goal-scoring production up for grabs alongside Peyton Halsey and incoming first-year Olivia Bent-Cole. She put 15 of her 21 shots on goal in 2022 which was the best mark among all non-backs on the team. Maintaining that clip isn’t impossible for Relford even if she starts every game for the ‘Cats this fall. M Regan Cornelius (JR) Cornelius also played her way into the starting lineup as the season drew on. Like Relford she appeared in every game and remained in Tracey Fuchs’ starting 11 through the final 13 games. While she didn’t score she put up 732 total minutes (eighth among all returners). By helping generate and maintain extra possessions for Northwestern Cornelius contributed to the team’s 12-4 record in one-score games. If the scoring load falls more on Halsey and Bent-Cole it’ll be crucial for the other midfielders to give them as many chances as possible. B Maja Zivojnovic (SO) Starting from Day One on any collegiate team is no joke. As a true freshman for a defending national champion though? That’s another story. Zivojnovic started the first 11 games at center back and she was the only first-year on the team to even start at all. She played a huge role in Northwestern’s 10-1 start — which featured eight wins over top 25 opponents — before she suffered an injury against Penn State that ended her season. The Rotterdam native should be a vital component of a defense that will lose Second Team All-American Kayla Blas. Alongside Alia Marshall Zivojnovic is a very good facilitator which should make NU’s backs one of the country’s most talented position groups. NU went its last 14 games without giving up more than two goals which makes Zivojnovic’s return all the more exciting. M/B Lauren Hunter (JR) Hunter played in every game and started eight of them. She also appeared in 23 contests as a first-year on the national championship-winning squad which makes it pretty likely that she’ll slide into the starting lineup in 2023. Hunter’s versatility was valuable in 2022 especially as a sub. Most of her starts came in early November during Big Ten play and she battled through 55 minutes in the UNC loss. Key subs M Lane Herbert (JR) Herbert was a focal point of the offense as a sub both as a passer and a scorer. She finished fourth on the team with five assists in 2022 even though she played just over half as many minutes as the three players above her. Herbert put up 20 shots on goal — four of which found the net. For a team that will need to find new ways to generate offense Herbert’s presence could be crucial. Whether or not she starts count on Fuchs to find ways to get the midfielder ample chances.  M Katie Jones (SR) Jones played in 22 games and started six of them. She had strong showings in early September and punctuated her season with four shots (three on-goal) in Northwestern’s shootout win over Miami (OH) in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Jones’ pressure on the defense mirrored NU’s; the Wildcats outshot the RedHawks 27-9 in their matchup. More scoring opportunities in Big Ten play could be coming Jones’ way. M Jordan Carr (SR) Carr appeared in 12 games for NU’s crowded midfield. She played big minutes in wins at Michigan State and Ohio State in mid-October. While there’s a good chance that Carr comes off the bench again she could move into the role that Jones played last year (giving her a significant boost in playing time). M/B Greta Hinke (SO) Hinke appeared in all 25 games as a first-year and she was a crucial sub for NU in late September and early October. That’s when the Wisconsinite received most of her playing time. Blas’s departure moves everyone up the depth chart on the back line so Hinke could be in line for more opportunities in her second season. F Aerin Krys (SO) Even as a first-year who didn’t play a ton Krys found herself in some very high-leverage situations. Both of Northwestern’s first two NCAA Tournament games — against Miami (OH) and Iowa — came down to shootouts. Krys had to take two penalty shots...and she made both of them. Depending on how Fuchs wants to structure her offense without Baekers in the fold Krys could leap up the depth chart if Northwestern doesn’t deploy too many of its midfielders as forwards. Don’t be surprised if she becomes a starter or super-sub as NU gets closer to the postseason. M Amelia Albers (Redshirt FR) Albers didn’t play in her first season with the program but could find herself stepping into a key role as a sub in 2023. As a high-schooler she earned All-State honors in Michigan twice and she has an ice hockey background that’s almost as extensive as her field hockey resume. Albers won two straight state titles on the ice for East Grand Rapids High School. Reserves M Maggie Powers (SR) Powers briefly appeared in three early-season games in 2022. As previously stated the fact that Fuchs will retain most of her key midfielders from the run to the national championship makes it difficult for Powers to move up the depth chart. M/F Lila Slattery (SR) Slattery saw action in the same three games that Powers did: against Maine Boston College and Richmond early in the year.  M/B Sophie Dix (JR) Dix only appeared in one game but that happened to be Northwestern’s Final Four tilt against Maryland. Her versatility has helped her thrive on U16 U17 and U19 national teams for her home country of Ireland. GK Jamie Marold (SR) Annabel Skubisz played nearly every minute of Northwestern’s 2022 season and that’ll likely be the case again in 2023 assuming she stays healthy. Marold is a very solid backup should anything happen though. She was a top 50 recruit in high school according to MAX Field Hockey and made two starts in 2021.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After two straight championship appearances the first of which earned Northwestern its first field hockey title ever in 2021 the bar for field hockey is high. The ‘Cats have become a top-tier program and they’re set on keeping up that reputation. A player in each one of Northwestern’s NCAA tournament games over her tenure Lauren Wadas has been a key player in NU’s rise to one of the best teams in the country. Today we’ll preview the senior midfielder to see how the veteran can help the Wildcats and herself win a second national title. Who is she? Senior; midfield; from Annville Pa.; US Women’s National Team member Career Stats 2680 minutes over 60 games; 13 goals; 35 points; 9.8 SH%; 56.4 SOG%. 2022 review Wadas was a key member of the ‘Cats’ national title run; in fact that goes for both championship runs. She has been a consistent and reliable player her past two seasons but her junior year saw her step up even more to contribute greatly on both sides of the pitch.  The midfielder started and played every game totaling the fourth-most minutes on the team last season. She also tallied six goals 15 points and three defensive saves with 56.7% of shots on goals. What was remarkable about Wadas’s season in particular was her performance in pressure-filled moments.  In a match-up against No. 6 Michigan the Pennsylvania native notched the walk-off 1-0 win for the Wildcats in double overtime which earned her a Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week nod.  Two of her three team-leading defensive saves came in the regular season against Maryland. The ‘Cats won the game in overtime with a big thanks to both of Wadas’ saves in the fourth quarter that kept the game even.  She rounded out the year by being named to the NCAA and Big Ten All-Tournament Teams along with the NFHCA All-West Field Team.   Strengths Wadas is an all-around strong player with both offensive and defensive abilities. Her greatest strength is her ability to be all over the field. She’s a strong defender with an ability to score attributing six and four goals respectively over her junior and sophomore seasons along with contributing to 15 and 13 points. Although Wadas doesn’t rack up a ton of points she does maximize opportunities when it counts. In fact Wadas shines in the important moments — a trait that didn’t just exist as an upperclassman. She knocked in the winning and sole goal with a minute left in regulation against No. 1 Iowa to send the Wildcats to the Final Four in 2021. Suffice to say when the game is on the line Wadas is the one you want on the field.  Weaknesses When Bente Baekers is your teammate no one is probably going to score nearly as many goals as she does. But Baekers is gone and it’s time for Wadas to tally some more goals. As a midfielder too it would have been nice to see the Women’s National Team member log more assists with only four and five the past two seasons. Wadas is a very present and noticeable member of the squad and hopefully this season is a chance to improve on finding the back of the goal with other high scorers graduating. Behind Baekers Wadas had the second-most shots with 67; however her .090 shooting percentage was the seventh highest.  Expectations  The expectation for Wadas is simple yet a tall task: she is going to be a leader on this team on and off the field. Tracey Fuchs returns a pretty veteran-heavy roster and Wadas is certainly one of the names that jumps out. She logged decent playing time as a first-year appearing in 14 games and starting in eight; her sophomore season she started 20 and played in 21 and last season she started every game. It’s easy to tell how versatile of a player she is and how prominent her presence is.  The bar for Wadas is high. She can be expected to dominate both sides of the ball and to considerably step up on the attack. Of the returning players she is tied for the second-most goals from last season at six with Ana Medina Garcia. Peyton Halsey then has the most with 13. There is clearly an opportunity for Wadas to become a high scorer and if there is anything Wadas has shown it’s that she knows to how to make the most of an opportunity.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Overview Returning Starters: Bryce Kirtz (R-Sr.) Jacob Gill (R-So.) Key Losses: Malik Washington (Virginia) Donny Navarro III (NFL UDFA) Wayne Dennis Jr. (Howard) Genson Hooper Price (Coastal Carolina) Returners: Raymond Niro III (R-Sr.) Calvin Johnson II (R-So.) Donnie Gray (R-So.) Reggie Fleurima (R-Fy.) Preston Bacon (R-Sr.) Jack Kennedy (R-Sr.) Newcomers: Cam Johnson (R-Sr. Arizona State) A.J. Henning (Sr. Michigan) Ricky Ahumaraeze (Fy.) Frank Covey IV (Fy.) Like the running back room the Northwestern receiving corps has lost its most productive member in Malik Washington. After managing to turn in a somewhat productive season catching passes from a number of different underwhelming quarterbacks Washington entered the transfer portal and left for UVA this spring. The ‘Cats were not productive through the air as a team; their 2524 yards were 10th in the Big Ten. Washington accounted for 27% of those air yards by himself racking up 694 in total on 65 receptions (also a team high). He didn’t find himself in the end zone particularly often scoring just one TD in 2022 but he provided a stable target for Ryan Hilinski Brendan Sullivan and others. Northwestern also will be without Evan Hull and Donny Navarro III its second and third-most productive pass-catchers last season. That’s a lot of production to replace but there is a glass half-full perspective to be had. Wide receiver is a position at which NU actually does have incoming talent largely in the form of already established college ball players who transferred to Evanston. Cam Johnson from Arizona State spent four years at Vanderbilt before joining the Sun Devils last season and transferring to NU for 2023. The best campaign of his career was 2020 when he amassed 545 yards on 56 receptions. Last year he had just 84 yards but Arizona State had other weapons to carry the load. Johnson should get an opportunity at Northwestern to be a key cog in the offense and the hope is that he can develop into a consistent target for quarterback Ben Bryant. The other transfer joining the room is A.J. Henning from Michigan. Henning excelled for the Wolverines mostly in the return game but he was at Michigan. It’s tough to get reps at receiver when you have to contend with the kind of talent they have in Ann Arbor. Henning is a shifty speedy receiver a skillset that might allow the ‘Cats to do some different things offensively. He should also be a factor as a returner just as he was in the blue and gold. Key player: Bryce Kirtz Johnson and Henning are inarguably important for Northwestern this year. It was tempting to tab Henning as the “key player” here because his athleticism combined with the opportunity he’s being presented with could spell big things.  But Bryce Kirtz also matters for this Northwestern offense. The ultimate question is whether he is capable of being more than just the 212-yard receiver he was last year. The target share should be higher for Kirtz but it remains to be seen whether he’ll take advantage of it.  He has a leg up in experience on virtually everyone else in the room having completed three whole seasons at Northwestern. If Kirtz can be a true factor for the ‘Cats then all of the sudden the receiving group as a whole starts to take shape and gives Bryant more weapons to throw to.  Big question: How much does it matter that Ben Bryant Cam Johnson and A.J. Henning are all transfers? You can’t fault Northwestern for being active in the transfer portal. It had to be. Otherwise the ‘Cats would be entering the season with no clear answer at the sport’s most important position and very few options for whoever they trotted out there to throw the ball to. Enter Bryant Johnson and Henning who (hopefully) will provide answers in those spots. However NUs offense is heavily reliant on all three working out and none of them have ever taken a snap in a Northwestern uniform. Granted the whole offense should be different under David Braun so everyone in the locker room will be learning. But the quarterback-wide receiver relationship is an important one and these guys have no established chemistry. The hope will be that the talent wins out. Bryant is the most promising quarterback the ‘Cats have had in the past couple of years and Johnson and Henning both possess the tools to take massive leaps forward in their college careers at Northwestern. Assuming they can develop a rapport with Bryant early everything should be fine. \nDepth Chart (according to Ourlads.com)\n \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After an unthinkable offseason for Northwestern football the ‘Cats have reported to training camp and have begun preparing for the 2023 season. With multiple allegations of sexual hazing and racism having rocked the program and long-time head coach Pat Fitzgerald subsequently terminated X’s and O’s were in the back of everyone’s minds for the past month. Now with David Braun at the helm the Wildcats will attempt to improve from their dreadful 1-11 record last season.  It is a tall task for the first-time head coach who has never even stepped foot on an FBS sideline to guide this squad to an average season let alone a successful one. While the storylines surrounding the ‘Cats are plentiful with nearly all having nothing to do with getting ready to play Rutgers on Sept. 3 here are some things to watch for during training camp: What does a Pat Fitzgerald-less Northwestern look like? The giant elephant in the room is impossible to ignore: for the first time since 2001 Pat Fitzgerald will not be on the Northwestern sideline. For the past 17 years Fitz was the face of not only Northwestern football but Northwestern University as a whole. It will be weird to not hear a classic Fitzism at a press conference or to not see him screaming his head off at basketball games. While Fitz was everywhere for Northwestern externally his style of football was the guiding principle for NUFB. Playing Big Ten football in the mid-’90s Fitzgerald led teams that embodied an old-school style of play. The ‘Cats’ philosophy was simple; they were going to run the ball control the clock and trust their defense to suffocate the opponent. Northwestern was tremendously successful early on with this gameplan especially as offenses still trotted out 12 and 13 personnel — two or three tight ends and one running back — as their primary offensive sets. However as offenses adapted to the spread offense and scored more points NU did not adjust at the same pace as the teams around them. ""As concepts such as the run-pass offense skyrocketed in popularity around college football Fitzgerald referred to it as “communism” and that reluctance to evolve definitely showed on the field. NU struggled to guard spread offenses oftentimes having unfavorable matchups against talented skill players. Furthermore as teams scored more points the ‘Cats’ offense of inside dives whams split zones and quick passes hindered the teams ability to mount comebacks or even stay in high-scoring games. Frankly the Wildcats’ gameplan was stale and did not give them a chance to be successful in today’s college football landscape."" ""With Fitzgerald no longer calling the shots Coach Braun and the entire staff have the opportunity to move Northwestern away from this old-school mentality and into a more modern approach. I’m interested to see what Mike Bajakian does with the offense this season although my expectations are admittedly low. If the ‘Cats can scheme up different and creative ways into their playmakers hands NU has speed on the edges to put opposing defenses on their heels. Northwestern really has nothing to lose this season and the expectations are as low as possible so why not try something new?"" Who will be the ‘Cats’ quarterback? In the past two seasons seven quarterbacks have taken snaps for Northwestern — including five different signal callers in 2022 — and to be blunt it has not been good. Northwestern failed to score a touchdown the entire month of November and the Wildcats’ QBs combined for 32 interceptions and fumbles last year both in the bottom 10 of 131 FBS programs.  Ryan Hilinski who entered the 2022 season as the ‘Cats’ starter was benched midway through the season due to poor performance and a knee injury late last season leaves him questionable to be ready for the 2023 season. Brendan Sullivan who replaced Hilinski last season showed flashes and came into spring practice as the front-runner for the starting gig. Sullivan a rising junior was a dual-threat quarterback who showed his talent with his legs but left a lot to be desired with his arm. Although No. 6 completed 74% of his passes last season he fired fewer than 30 passes more than 10 yards from the line of scrimmage. While Sullivan could be the answer the ‘Cats are looking for there is still a lot of improvement to be seen before NU can feel comfortable with him under center. Sophomore Jack Lausch is another option for Northwestern but is still a rather unknown prospect only seeing game action in the second half of the Wildcats’ blowout loss to Illinois last season. After the conclusion of spring practice Northwestern brought in Cincinnati QB Ben Bryant as a sixth-year transfer. Bryant who started nine games for the Bearcats last season had a three-to-one touchdown to interception ratio last season posting 21 scores to only seven picks. He threw for nearly 3000 yards on over 60% of passes completed. In his lone game against a Big Ten opponent Bryant threw for 354 yards and four touchdowns against Indiana. The newest Wildcat was aided by NFL-level pass catchers but he has shown the ability to make all the throws a Big Ten quarterback needs to make.  At Big Ten Media Day Coach Braun said that there would be a QB competition during camp between Bryant Sullivan and Lausch for the starting job but bringing Bryant in after watching the two underclassmen play all spring would suggest otherwise. I would be very surprised if Bryant was not leading NU’s offense in Week One but if Sullivan or Lausch play tremendously it is possible that they could snatch the gig away from the transfer. How do players handle the situation? We have not heard from any players through a press conference since the first allegations of hazing were reported from The Daily Northwestern and Pat Fitzgerald was fired. Sure there have been social media posts or a letter signed by the entire team in support of Fitzgerald but none have answered questions from the media. All three players pulled out of Big Ten Media Day saying “we did not want our participation to be dominated by the hazing issue and steal focus away from football and the upcoming season.” However players will have to not only talk to the media but be able to focus on the season ahead. Coach Braun said that this team would have to overcome this adversity to be successful this season; however this is self-inflicted adversity.  In the original article by The Daily Northwestern the whistleblower said that the hazing rituals were taking place during the 2022 season so many of the players on the roster would have been around while these horrendous incidents took place. I am interested to see how these players handle increased media scrutiny something that Northwestern is not accustomed to. As the players prepare for Week One it’ll be imperative that they remain solely focused on football yet that seems nearly impossible with all the noise surrounding the program. Losing your head coach is hard but losing a head coach less than a month before training camp is even harder. Many of these players had to make decisions about there futures over the past month and whether or not they even wanted to stay at Northwestern.  Now as the players report for camp and get ready to take the field in less than a month it will be interesting to see how locked in the ‘Cats are on the field or if the off-the-field allegations too much to handle. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Overview Returning starters: Charlie Mangieri (Gr.) Marshall Lang (Sr.) Thomas Gordon (R-Sr.) Key losses: None Returners: Duke Olges (R-Sr.) Chris Petrucci (So.) Hunter Welcing (Sr.) Lawson Albright (Jr.) Blake Van Buren (So.) Newcomers: Camp Magee (Fy.) Jack Fitzgerald (Fy.) Northwestern’s tight end group wasn’t the driving engine of the 2022 offense but it was one of the team’s deepest position rooms. Without any departures — unless you want to count first-year Chico Holt who transferred to Stanford in the wake of Pat Fitzgerald’s firing — that depth can only increase. In fact the tight ends are so experienced that one can argue they make up the strongest position group on the team. Given how often Mike Bajakian has employed two and three-tight end sets in the past that strength in numbers is key. In addition to the returns of Lang and Gordon who were among NU’s steadiest targets last season the ‘Cats will get their 2021 starter back after he missed the final nine games of 2022. Charlie Mangieri should be a nice add to a receiving corps that was already thin going into the offseason before Northwestern lost its top three pass-catchers. There are at least three potential starters in the fold and that’s never a bad thing.  Key Player Marshall Lang Lang played a pretty significant role in the passing game last year and was the leading receiver from the tight end room with 192 yards. Even when he shared the field with Mangieri in 2021 the Cincinnati native saw more red zone looks and snagged more passes than any other tight end on the team. Unless Gordon plays so well that he earns a lion’s share of targets Lang’s role in the receiving department is almost definitely going to be significant without a slew of returning pass-catchers who have seen the field. His pass and run-blocking haven’t been great but that’s where having three potential starters in the room comes in handy. At the same time though improvement in those areas from Lang could give Northwestern some offensive versatility. If Bajakian is going to maintain a run-heavy offense and his offensive line is going to reshuffle then there’s a good chance he’s going to value blocking tight ends when it comes to snap distribution. Should Lang improve enough there he can go from a reliable receiving option to a player NU can scheme around on every play. Big Question Who are the starters and how many of them are there? Gordon Lang Mangieri and even Duke Olges all have on-field experience. Because of that and NU’s traditional emphasis on the run there’s a decent chance that the ‘Cats will regularly roll with multiple TEs. Even though David Braun could make a different call Bajakian is still calling plays and North Dakota State’s offense was just as reliant on power rushing and short passing.  Mangieri’s return makes this especially interesting. Even when he entered 2021 as the starter Lang played significantly near the end of the year. Now with Gordon having emerged as a solid receiver who was good enough in 2022 to split time with Lang Northwestern has three starting options. It remains to be seen if Bajakian will rotate them depending on the situation if he’ll run with just two or if there will be packages where he’ll deploy the entire trio. If one of them doesn’t play well does a younger player like Chris Petrucci or even Camp Magee emerge like Lang did as a sophomore?  These are pretty good problems to have and when looking at the rest of the roster it’s clear that they’re some of the best question marks Northwestern has right now. \nDepth Chart (via ourlads.com)\n  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Is the Women’s World Cup not giving you enough of your women’s soccer fix? Not very surprising given that Northwestern women’s soccer is the true pinnacle of the sport and it has been too long without it. However wait no longer because the ‘Cats’ season is just around the corner and Inside NU has you covered. A deep bench will be critical if the Wildcats want to build upon their success from last season. As we continue our preseason coverage we’ll highlight the potential substitutes for coach Michael Moynihan this season. F Hayley Newman Sophomore Last season Newman appeared in 12 games for a total of 123 minutes mostly coming in to give star forwards Aurea del Carmen and Meg Boade valuable rest. Her best performance came against SIUE when she dished out an assist in her 36 minutes on the pitch. This year Newman will likely continue to serve as a depth piece and her role could seek to increase if she shows potential in the high wings to fill the gap left by Lily Gilbertson. M Gabriella Grust Junior Grust has only played in two games in her Northwestern career but she’s had the opportunity to learn from and train with some of the best midfielders in the Big Ten. That development could allow her to play a bigger role off the bench in 2023. M Kelsey Kwon Junior Over her two years at Northwestern Kwon has played in 12 games with her most notable performance being 19 minutes in the NCAA Tournament Sweet 16. As the team was dealing with a few different injuries Kwon came in off the bench to try and keep the ‘Cats in the game. Northwestern ultimately fell 2-0 but gaining that postseason should prove invaluable for Kwon as she looks to expand her role this season. D Ramira Ambrose Sophomore Ambrose did not make any appearances during her first year on the team but she could see an increased role as a playmaker on the back line. In high school Ambrose finished with the fifth most assists by a defender. She was also a member of the Minnesota All-State team and a state champion so this experience could come in handy for the sophomore. M Sydney Panek Senior Panek has only played in one game over three years at Northwestern with her sole appearance coming against SIUE. Three years under Moynihan’s tutelage should have resonated though and Panek will look to provide some veteran leadership if her number is called. D Charis Toney Sophomore Toney did not see the field in her first season as a Wildcat but she could prove a helpful addition to the Northwestern defense. The sophomore was the No. 15 defender in her high school class and the teachings of new assistant coach Jennie Clark could help her become even more lockdown. F Elyse DeSchryver Senior The fourth-year out of Michigan has not played since the 2021 season but she’ll likely be a valuable depth piece up top. Over three years at Forest Hills Northern High School DeSchryver scored 57 goals. This scoring ability could add to the already impressive numbers put up by Northwestern strikers. M Alisha Ware Sophomore Like her teammate Newman Ware appeared in 12 games during her first season in Evanston. The Brit featured in 169 minutes over the first 13 games of the 2022 season. Ware also boasts an impressive pedigree from back home across the pond. She played for England’s youth national team (U15-U19) while also being a member of Southhampton’s first team. This experience can make Ware a force to be reckoned with in her sophomore season.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story When David Braun first stepped on campus in January he thought he was joining the staff of one of the longest-tenured head coaches in college football and had strong job stability. However a mere six months later Braun has been thrust into the spotlight being named the ‘Cats’ interim head coach after Pat Fitzgerald was terminated in early July. Embattled in a hazing scandal that has sent shockwaves through collegiate athletics Braun inherits a program that needs a complete rebuild both on and off the field. The Wildcats are 4-20 over their last two seasons and have not won a game on American soil in 661 days. In three of its last four seasons Northwestern has emerged victorious in three or fewer games. To put it frankly the Wildcats have been abysmal on the field and now have to contend with their names in the headlines for all the wrong reasons.  As Braun put it at Big Ten Media Day “I never could have imagined nor did I desire to become a head coach under these types of circumstances.” Whether he thought his big break would happen like this Braun has the chance to lead the ‘Cats at a tipping point in program history. His first-ever FBS game will be as the head coach of a Big Ten program and for Braun’s squad the expectations are low. However if the Wildcats can exceed expectations he could land himself the permanent gig. The goals for NU cover a wide variety but here are some that Braun should hone in on for the 2023 season. Be Transparent  In a team embroiled in a massive scandal Northwestern has been less than open about what is going on inside its athletic department. It has still yet to release the original hazing report from Maggie Hickey where 11 former players said that sexual hazing occurred inside the program and both Michael Schill and Derrick Gragg have taken very few questions from the media. Now none of this has been Braun’s fault but transparency will go a long way in regaining the trust of players recruits alumni students fans and the media.  Under Coach Fitzgerald Northwestern was known to be tight-lipped about everything. The Wildcats never released a depth chart and refused to acknowledge injuries; in fact Ryan Hilinski’s knee injury has never been confirmed by NU even though the gunslinger posted a photo of himself having surgery a few days after being carted off in Minneapolis. Fitz also spoke a lot in coach speak opting to be cliché instead of giving answers that gave insight into Northwestern’s plan of attack. Unlike men’s basketball head coach Chris Collins who will sit at the podium for 30 minutes and explain everything in great detail Northwestern football has always been quiet. Doing these basic things and allowing more access and insight into the program will help rebuild the trust between the football team and the community. I think Braun is already off to a good start with this opening practice up to the media for the next three Wednesdays and allowing parts of practice to be filmed — something that never happened under Fitzgerald.  Braun will have to contend with a media circus for the beginning of his tenure with almost no questions being about actual football. I am aware that he cannot comment on pending litigation but answering all other questions honestly and openly throughout the entire season will not only endear him to fans but also help restore trust that he has a grip on the program and ensure that things are being done properly. Build a resemblance of a recruiting class This may be the hardest thing Braun has to do. Due to all of the uncertainty surrounding the program and Fitz’s popularity amongst recruits being high Northwestern has seen a mass exodus of 2024 recruits since Fitzgerald was terminated with 6 players de-committing from Northwestern. Right now the Wildcats still have nine players committed to joining the program in 2024 but that is well below the 20 NU brought in this past recruiting cycle. It will be Braun’s job to convince these recruits to come to Evanston despite not knowing whether or not he will still be employed by the time this class steps on campus.  It is an uncertainty that recruits hate because the coach that recruited them may not be the coach they play for meaning that players will have to win over a different staff to see the field. Furthermore due to the nature of the hazing allegations Braun will have to convince parents that Northwestern is a great place to send their son and that they will be taken care of by the program. Right now Northwestern football’s reputation is in the gutter and Braun is at the forefront of the rebuild. He will have to show recruits that NU can not only be great on the field but also off the field. Braun can tout academics and playing in the Big Ten all he wants but he will have to convince recruits that Northwestern is the best place for them whether he is there or not. That is a tall task because recruits normally want to play for the coach who recruited them but if the Wildcats can bring in 10 more solid recruits and fill their class you have to consider the 2024 cycle a win for Braun. Bring the defense back ""Let’s talk some football. When Braun was originally hired in January he intended to replace Jim O’Neil as the Wildcats’ defensive coordinator. Under O’Neil the ‘Cats defense was bad looking like the exact opposite of a team that won games due to their punishing defense.  Northwestern gave up more than 28 points a game on average and finished in the bottom half of the FBS in team defense in both seasons. That is a far cry from the 2020 season where NU finished fifth in the nation in team defense. O’Neils’ scheme often created unfavorable matchups for his defense forcing interior players to cover skill positions on the outside. NU also struggled to stop the run giving up nearly 200 yards a game on the ground in 2022. All in all from the moment Kenneth Walker took it 75 yards to score just 13 seconds into O’Neils’ tenure at NU it was a horrid two-year stretch for the Wildcat defense."" Braun’s defenses at North Dakota State have been the exact opposite of horrid finishing as one of the best defenses in the FCS each season. In Braun’s first season in Fargo  the Bisons led the FCS in both points and yards allowed on their way to a national championship. As one of their players told me it was not the scheme that made the defense work but Braun’s ability to tailor the scheme to the players’ strengths. In fact NDSU’s defense was so stifling that Braun was named the 2021 FCS coordinator of the year by Footballscoop. Braun’s defensive prowess is widely regarded around college football and it is the reason Northwestern originally hired him. Braun’s motto of play free play fast allows players to not think while they are on the field something Fitzgerald said hindered the team under O’Neil. As Braun said at media day “I think I have a skill for identifying what our players do well and then really leaning into that.”  If Braun truly wants to allow his players to play freely his scheme will play to the skillset of the Wildcats which means having an extra defensive back on the field so Bryce Gallagher never has to guard a spread tight end and allowing the ‘Cats’ traditional Big Ten linebackers to play downhill and help in run support. No one is expecting a dramatic turnaround overnight for this defense especially with the key losses it faced over the offseason but to have a defense that keeps games competitive is all Braun could ask for this season. It felt at times that NU had no chance in a game because the defense could not find an answer but if Braun sets the players up to use their skillset the Wildcats will not be searching for answers mid-game. Braun has the impossible task of trying to lead this team on and off the field all while worrying about his own future in a position he never imagined being in saying “I’ve never been this far outside my comfort zone before.” While the expectations for this team are low Braun has a chance to pull NU from the mud and begin to put it back on the right trajectory. Will he be able to do it? We have no idea but if he can meet a few of these goals the Wildcats will set themselves up for success down the line. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

What next? Share this story Northwestern surprised pundits across the collegiate soccer landscape in 2022 as it started the season unranked in the coaches poll only to finish the year ranked No. 11. A major contributor to the ‘Cats’ success was defender Emma Phillips. She saw her minutes increase and her usage expand from 2021 to 2022. Now heading into her junior season and on a team that’s currently ranked No. 18 in the nation Phillips has plenty to live up to. Who she is Junior; defender; 5-foot-11; from Munster In.; member of the 2018 U15 U.S. Soccer National Team pool and a 2017 ECNL National Championship Finalist. Career Stats 80.1 minutes per game; three goals; two assists; 44.4% shots on goal; statistics for defenders are hard to keep track of so these figures don’t give Phillips a fair showing. 2022-2023 review Phillips got off to a good start in the 2022 campaign as she and the rest of the backline let up only three goals in the first nine games of the season. More than that the Indiana native and her teammates made it unbelievably tough for opposing attackers to get a shot on goal.  In the ‘Cats’ first-ranked win of the season Phillips and Co. allowed only No. 19 Xavier to get off four shots on goal. That was the trend of the season. A few weeks later against a Big Ten foe in Wisconsin the rapid pressure applied by the unit was enough to limit the Badgers to one shot on goal in the entire first half. Despite her best efforts on defense Phillips’ claim to fame in 2022 was a go-ahead bicycle kick goal against Kansas State which clinched both a comeback win and thousands of views across social media. The gravity-defying knock demonstrates Phillips’ ability to contribute on both ends of the pitch. Tallying eight points on the year Phillips didn’t cross midfield much. But when she did she was as good as any other defender at pushing the ball and finding the back of the net. Phillips nabbed a Second Team All-Big Ten selection at the end of the season as recognition for her acrobatic goals and aggressive defensive tactics. Expectations Phillips has developed the way that every coach prays for when they recruit a player out of high school. In her freshman year she showed well in practice earning her start in 14 of the 17 games played that season. In her sophomore outing she started 20 of 21 games she appeared in.  The defender also saw a slight uptick in her minutes across her first two seasons averaging about 77 minutes per contest in 2021 and a bit over 80 minutes per game in 2022. Last season was also Phillips’ first in which she scored a collegiate goal or nabbed an assist. Head coach Michael Moynihan is clearly interested in loosening the reins on his All-Big Ten defender letting her cross the midfield line more and more as she’s developed. What does this mean for 2023? Well expect Phillips’ playing time to stay about the same given there are only so many minutes she can play without rest. However assuming nothing goes catastrophically awry she’ll get the start in every game she’s healthy. It wouldn’t be surprising to see Moynihan continue letting his defender creep up the field especially in crunch time. A utility player is never a bad thing to have in sports and as Phillips gains seniority on the team it makes sense that the coaching staff might want her to take the lead in as many departments as possible. Her defensive production shows no sign of stopping and considering NU’s elite goal protection last season there isn’t much room to improve. Still having a ball-hawking scrappy veteran defender like Phillips can only help a team that has high expectations heading into the season. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story As fans prepare for field hockey to return they anxiously await to see how the new talent on Northwestern’s team fits in and who on the roster will step up. Amidst the change they’ll find great comfort in seeing familiar proven talent on the field. Alia Marshall is as familiar with Northwestern field hockey as anyone and in her fifth season she brings knowledge leadership experience and a great deal of talent to the roster.  Who is she? Graduate student; midfield/back; from Rehoboth Beach De.; U.S. Women’s National Team Member Career Stats 3733 minutes over 85 games; seven goals; 38 points; 80 SOG%. 2022 Review Marshall has been essential to the ‘Cats over her career playing midfield and helping to anchor the defense. The Women’s National Team member’s contributions and role in Northwestern’s success really materialized in her senior season in which she started all 24 games.  The defensive middie is not necessarily in a position to score many goals — though she did tally two — but that didn’t keep her from having the second-most assists on the team. Marshall was Tracy Fuchs’ go-to inserter for corners and it’s easy to see why given her 13 assists and 17 points. Many of these came in big moments with the Delaware native notching assists in the Big 10 quarterfinals semifinals the NCAA quarterfinals the Final Four and the championship. She’s a player with a great ability to manage the field whether that be helping the ‘Cats defend or score goals.  Expectations  Marshall choosing to stay for a fifth season is nothing short of a blessing. Having played 20 games as a freshman her significance to the program over her tenure is evident. Now given the departures of Kayla Blas and Shannon Daley it’s crucial to have such an experienced player lead the backs. Fuchs’ has a roster with lots of experience but that is very much a feature of the offense. Filling in for Blas and Daley will likely be sophomore Maja Zivojnovic and junior Lauren Hunter. Zivojnovic got off to a great start in 2022 starting the first 11 games of the year before suffering a season-ending injury and Hunter has garnered up a decent amount of playing time but not at the starting position. Marshall will be expected to lead the backs and hold together the team in front of Annabel Skubisz.  Along with being held to a high defensive standard Fuchs will look to Marshall to continue a trend of gathering many assists and helping the team finish on corners. Given her skill set Marshall may top off her team in points and minutes played this season.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story As we continue to prepare for the 2023 season today we look at arguably the most important position in football the offensive line. Amidst heavy turnover the ‘Cats will have multiple new faces in the trenches this season. Overview Returning Starters: Josh Priebe (Sr.) Caleb Tiernan (R-So.) Key Losses: Peter Skoronski Vincent Picozzi Ethan Wiederkehr Charlie Schmidt Conrad Rowley Returning members:  Josh Thompson (R-So.) Dom D’Antonio (R-Sr.) Jackson Carsello (R- So.) Braeden Edwards (R-So.) Ben Wrather (Sr.) Deuce McGuire (R-Fy.) Nick Herzog (R-Fy.) Luka Trifunovic (R-Sr.) Zachary Franks (R-Sr.) New Additions: Jordan Knox (Fy.) Anthony Birsa (Fy.) Alexander Doost (Fy.) Flashback to opening day a year ago only one of these names was on the field when the ‘Cats played in Dublin. Now there is a strong possibility that NU will have five new players across the O-line when it takes the field in Piscataway this September. The ‘Cats lost multiple stalwarts among their protection unit with unanimous All-American Peter Skoronski sixth-year Ethan Wiederkehr and center Charlie Schmidt all leaving the program after the 2022 campaign. The trio barely missed a snap all season playing in all 12 games and combining for 2614 snaps. The only returning member of the position group to start in Week Zero last year was Priebe who slotted in at left guard. Priebe held down the position for half the season before he was carted off with a knee injury presumably a torn ACL against Maryland. His status for Week One is unknown as interim head coach David Braun declined to speak on specific injuries at the Big Ten Media Days. Right now there seems to be an open competition for every spot on the line especially on the interior where the center and both guard jobs are up for grabs. NU will have to rely upon unproven members of the position group to make the offense work.  Key Player G/T Josh Priebe If what former head coach Pat Fitzgerald said in the spring remains true under Coach Braun the expectation is that Priebe will bump outside to protect the blindside and play left tackle. For the last four years left tackle has been NU’s best position on the field. The ‘Cats have produced back-to-back top-15 picks with Skoronski and Rashawn Slater holding down the fort. In the last four seasons NU’s blindside protectors have only given up five sacks so the pressure on Priebe to perform is immense. Even though the rising senior has performed well on the interior kicking out to tackle is a whole different beast. Priebe will no longer be contending with defensive tackles who use their power to overwhelm opponents but with the premier edge rushers of the Big Ten. He will have to cover more ground and will be left on an island and expected to win — not as easy as having a double-team assignment with the center. In addition to learning a new position Priebe will still be working his way back from a significant knee injury. Sure he can test it in practice but it is difficult to recreate the adrenaline and speed of a live game. Priebe will be expected to generate a large amount of power from his legs to kick in his pass set putting exorbitant pressure on his knees. Knee injuries can be very difficult for offensive linemen to recover from so whether Priebe can make a full-season comeback remains to be seen. ""No one is expecting or even asking Priebe to be as good as his two predecessors but if he can be a solid tackle it will go a long way in supporting the Wildcats offense. No. 68 is a phenomenal puller and moves very well for an offensive lineman. With this ability to block in the open field Northwestern will use him as a lead blocker on counters and on sweeps. Furthermore with presumed starting quarterback Ben Bryant being right-handed it will be Priebe’s job to block his blindside. If the rising senior can keep Bryant upright it will allow the sixth-year quarterback time to look downfield and find the open receiver. With the struggles the QB room has had over the past two seasons giving Bryant time to go through his reads is crucial if NU’s offense wants to succeed in 2023."" Big Question Who starts on the interior? Schmidt Weiderkehr Picozzi and Rowley took nearly all the snaps last season on the inside of the offensive line and none of them will don the purple and white in 2023. So the question is who will replace them? Assuming the tackle position is filled by Priebe and Tiernan that leaves the other three positions void. The only other person who took snaps at center last season was Wrather but he only had 11 plays at the position so it feels safe to assume that the job is anybody’s to win. At the guard spot Wrather saw 159 snaps the most among the reserves and no other player on the 2023 roster had more than 11 snaps at either guard slot.  The answer is that no one knows who will be in the huddle come early September and training camp will be extremely important to try and forecast who will take the field for the Wildcats against Rutgers. These jobs are for the taking even for first-year players like Jordan Knox. There is so much uncertainty surrounding the position group and offensive line coach Kurt Anderson will have to whip his five into shape quickly during camp if Northwestern wants to mount a comeback season. \nDepth Chart (via ourlads.com)\n  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After the departure of Utah Arizona and Arizona State to the Big 12 it was announced on Friday that Washington and Oregon would be joining the Big Ten. After the additions of USC and UCLA the conference now stands at 18 programs and is a true national grouping spanning from Seattle and Los Angeles to Piscataway and College Park. The announcement rattled the college sports landscape like a West Coast earthquake and with a few dominoes still left to fall it remains to be seen just how widespread the ramifications will be. Ultimately this move is not the “death of college sports” like some pundits claim but the situation is complex and unsurprisingly motivated by money. For starters the days of conferences being regional entities are gone. The Big Ten covers coast to coast the new Big 12 stretches from Orlando to Salt Lake City and rumors of Cal and Stanford joining the ACC would destroy the “Atlantic Coast” element of the “Atlantic Coast Conference.”  One of the biggest draws to college football was how each conference and each region had it’s own distinct style of play. The Big Ten was run-first physical and gritty while the Big 12 featured high-flying offenses and exorbitant point totals. That is no longer the case. In a few years it’s possible that nobody will care about regional identities as they continue to tune into exciting Oregon-Michigan matchups but for diehard college football plans this loss is notable. Traditional rivalries also become a casualty of the new conference structure. Although both schools have indicated they intend to keep state rivalries intact the loss of Oregon-Oregon State and Washington-Washington State on the conference schedule matchups that have faced off 126 and 114 times respectively is a major blow. Instead we will get matchups like Oregon-Maryland and Oregon-Rutgers who have never played each other in program history. Even Washington-Penn State which seems exciting on paper will not draw the same fervent passion as the annual Apple Cup and the geographic rivalry that those two schools have built. In terms of logistics the Big Ten now clearly a mega-conference could realistically field as many as five playoff teams in the expanded 12-team playoff format which will begin in 2024 — the same year all four West Coast teams will join the conference.  The conference’s 2024 and 2025 schedule which had already been announced will have to be revised to account for the two new additions. The current “flex protect plus” model which allowed for each team to have up to three protected rivals and guaranteed that each team would play a home and away matchup against every program in a four-year span no longer works.  The Big Ten may have to implement a plan that gives each team one protected rival to play every season. The remaining sixteen teams would be split into two with eight more games each year to fill out the nine-game conference gauntlet. This would still allow for each team to host every other opponent in the conference once every four years ensuring matchups once every two seasons. However this would take away annual rivalries such as Michigan-Michigan State with only Michigan-Ohio State being able to be protected. The schedule-makers will have to find a format that maintains rivalries limits the amount of cross-country trips and ensures that teams will play one another with some regularity.  It is possible that the conference could re-implement some sort of division structure. Although the new model was supposed to strip the conference of the West and East divisions especially if the conference continues to expand it may make logistical sense to create a West Coast division to cut down on travel and keep those rivalries in place.  For Northwestern specifically Washington and Oregon’s arrival only further crowds the competitive field. The ‘Cats won their only meeting in program history against the Ducks but are 0-3 all-time against the Huskies. Without being able to rely on a historically weaker West Division the Wildcats face an uphill battle to be one of the two best teams in an 18-team conference — what it’ll take to have the chance to play for a conference championship. Oregon and Washington are consistent powerhouses and despite USC and UCLA typically being recognized as the biggest brands of the conference formerly known as the Pac-12 (technically it is still alive as the Pac-4 or something) Oregon and Washington were the only teams to represent the conference in the CFP. Years down the line eyeballs will still be glued to Ohio State-USC matchups on the gridiron as TV contracts continue to get more and more lucrative. The Pac-12 may be talked about the way sports hipsters discuss the USFL Southwest Conference or Montreal Expos. The basketball will probably be fun and exciting too. The biggest negative impact will be felt by the dozens of sports that don’t get quite as much exposure. Washington and Oregon’s addition upends the athletic programs for both schools from top to bottom. Several softball athletes from Pac-12 schools have spoken up about conference realignment pointing out the failure of the NCAA to protect all athletes: Several softball players who compete for schools that are leaving the Pac-12 have spoken out against the latest round of conference realignment.They cited mental health and further distances for their families to travel for road games. pic.twitter.com/jeURfGGqjC These claims are completely justified. Will student-athletes at one of the West Coast schools have to make double-digit trips to the Midwest each season? As University of Michigan regent Jordan Acker explained in a thread of tweets (X’s?) that I highly recommend reading it would take less time for non-chartered travel from Ann Arbor to London than from Ann Arbor to Eugene for a matchup with Oregon. Ultimately this decision was dictated by money. Television dollars and profit were front of mind and as a result football was prioritized above all else creating a trickle down effect that adversely affects every other sport while killing the Pac-12 in the process.  In those other sports Northwestern faces a similar crowding issue as in football with the introduction of two more competitive programs. Historically Oregon has fielded strong teams in women’s basketball track and field baseball and golf. Washington boasts competitive teams in golf rowing men’s soccer and softball. At Big Ten Media Days the commissioner and several football coaches discussed how the transfer portal is the single biggest issue in college football yet in the past calendar year we have seen the programs themselves participate in their own version of the transfer portal hopping from conference to conference in search of the most profitable arrangement. How fair is it to condemn athletes for attempting to do the same? Finally on a lighter note: Washington Huskies you’ve been warned. Don’t think you can waltz into the Big Ten late to the party and be the primary purple-wearing team of the conference. That crown belongs to Northwestern. Although you may actually reside in the Northwest of the United States WE are Northwestern and purple belongs to us. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Correction: An earlier version of this article said that Doucette averaged 55 minutes per game last season. That figure is her career average and in 2022 she played about 86 minutes per game. The article has been corrected to account for that difference. Northwestern’s defense was one of the main reasons the ‘Cats managed to finish the 2022 season at No. 11 in the coaches poll. Fielding 10 shutouts in 23 games players like Emma Phillips and Danika Austin proved pivotal to the team’s success. Nicole Doucette was another starter on the unit and heading into her senior season she still has more to prove. Who is she? Senior; defender; 5-foot-5; from Lake Bluff Ill.; played on the No. 4 club team in the country in 2019 and majors in Communication Studies. Career Stats 55.4 minutes per game; one goal; two assists; 21.4% shots on goal; statistics for defenders are hard to keep track of so these figures don’t give Doucette a fair showing. 2022-2023 review There is a flurry of positions across sports that lack the glamorizing statistics that so easily entrance fans yet are vital to the success of any team. Defenders in soccer are one of those units. On the statsheet Nicole Doucette’s 2022 campaign didn’t impress via an evident goal-scoring prowess or an unselfish knack for assists. But head coach Michael Moynihan saw in the Lake Bluff native what she offered on the grittier part of the pitch — the ‘Cats’ side of the halfway line. Doucette started all 23 games for NU last season contributing to double-digit shutouts. Her high-energy burst-heavy methods translated into a persistent counterattack against attacking opponents. Despite these impressive efforts what will serve as Doucette’s claim to fame in the pantheon of Northwestern sports is her game-winning goal against Rutgers in the Big Ten Tournament Semifinal. The defender was entrusted by Moynihan and Co. to attack more in the postseason. Expectations Now entering her senior season expect Doucette’s role in Northwestern’s gameplan to face a critical fork in the road. While Phillips and Danika Austin the other defensive stalwart in NU’s scheme flex a career average of playing more than 80 minutes per game Doucette only ascended to that level last year when she averaged over 86 minutes per game. That isn’t to say Doucette isn’t an asset to the team. Rather her role as a starter isn’t as cemented. First-year Keira Wagner is set to arrive on campus in the fall meaning there will be new blood to challenge the senior for minutes. Seniority will be on Doucette’s side but with a more crowded position room and two starting spots already locked up how much action she sees will remain a mystery until a few games into the year. All this to say that Doucette might see a dip in minutes this year along with her fellow veteran teammates. Of course she won’t be subjugated to the bench after starting and playing north of 86 minutes a game last year. Wagner and reserves on the defense could easily appear to need more time to develop leaving Doucette the clear front-runner for the field action. In any case the ‘Cats will look forward to her stifling contributions in 2023. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Update: Inside NU learned that Medina Garcia will not return to Northwestern for the 2023 season.  With the field hockey season less than three weeks away from officially beginning Wildcats’ fans are ready for a quick retool and reload. While stars of last year’s squad like Bente Baekers and Kayla Blas are gone there are still plenty of reasons to believe that Northwestern can continue to contend. One of those reasons is Ana Medina Garcia the fifth year who started every game for the Wildcats last year. In her fifth year she should serve as both a key source of offense and leadership. Who is she? Medina Garcia is a graduate student midfielder (although she played anywhere from center back to center forward last year) from Madrid Spain. Career Stats 58 games 2912 minutes 15 goals 10 assists 40 points 58% SOG eight game-winning goals. 2022 Review The fifth-year midfielder is a premier example of how hard work and tenacity lead to results. She’s developed from not playing at all in her freshman year to starting every contest last season.  Medina Garcia has been a Swiss army knife for the Wildcats being used in a multitude of situations and she fulfilled that role with aplomb last season She finished third on the team in minutes and goals and also tied for fifth in assists. She always shined bright in the biggest moments scoring goals against No. 18 Duke No. 9 Virginia and No. 21 Ohio State. She was also able to show off her passing skill against Richmond garnering a pair of assists. However Medina Garcia’s best talent was the ability to finish games off. She garnered four goals that qualified as game-winning all of them in different ways. Her first-half goal against Duke set the tone for a 2-0 victory. Furthermore against Michigan State she gave the Wildcats the lead for well less than four minutes into the fourth quarter. Her winner against Ohio State in overtime was a wonderful goal as well but she saved her best for last. Against Iowa in the second round of the NCAA tournament the Wildcats hope for a repeat seemed dim. They needed a late goal from Baekers to even force overtime and couldn’t score in either extra period leading to a stroke-off. With the stroke-off tied at 3 goals apiece Medina Garcia powered home a goal. After Iowa couldn’t convert its next opportunity Northwestern was back to the final four. Expectations Any time a player with nearly 3000 career minutes chooses to come back for a fifth year it’s a major boost for a team and Medina Garcia is no different. Her 58 games include 16 appearances in either the Big Ten or NCAA tournaments so she is no stranger to big moments. That experience is likely to prove useful for the offense. With Baekers and Blas (responsible for 77 total points) gone some of the returners will need to step up their games and Medina Garcia is a likely candidate. She’ll also almost certainly be the one in control late in games considering her penchant for late-game heroics. While fellow fifth-year Alia Marshall will likely control the distributing duties it is Medina Garcia and grad student Peyton Halsey who will see their scoring responsibilities increased.  Of course the minutes will continue to stay high. Medina Garcia was third on the team last year behind only goalkeeper Annabel Skubisz and the departed Blas. There’s a chance she’ll play more minutes than anyone not named Skubisz this year. If everything breaks right for Northwestern some of those minutes may once again be in the national championship game.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Following a hazing scandal that led to the firing of Pat Fitzgerald — and which captured national headlines for weeks — Northwestern football held its first open training camp practice and media session on Wednesday. In addition to hearing from Wildcat players since the timeline began on July 7 reporters were also granted access to a 50-minute window of team drills. Below are several of the major takeaways of NU’s first of three August media availabilities. Northwestern coaches spark controversy with Fitzgerald-supportive shirts Many would have figured that NU’s first practice with media in attendance would serve as a bridge back into coverage of more football as opposed to the off-the-field issues that have swamped the program and university for the last month. However even that goal did not come to fruition. Multiple Wildcat coaches and staffers including offensive coordinator Mike Bajakian were seen wearing “Cats Against the World” shirts. These shirts also contained No. 51 which belonged to Fitzgerald when he played in Evanston. Below are two pictures of the shirts being worn on Hutcheson Field. Several Northwestern coaches/staffers including OC Mike Bajakian are donning ""Cats Against the World"" shirts with No. 51 — Pat Fitzgerald\s old jersey number — on them. pic.twitter.com/ZFQ3tNU1Vv A clear shot of the ""Cats Against the World"" shirt that some Northwestern coaches/staff members were wearing at practice with Pat Fitzgerald\s old jersey #51 on them (as @Bradley_Locker first noted)@cbschicago pic.twitter.com/3fvnc0GEND Naturally the images and news spread rapidly on social media with fans and media members alike expressing frustration anger and even sadness regarding the staff’s lack of contrition for the severe hazing allegations. Some even indicated the decision to wear the shirts somewhat of a tribute to Fitzgerald might push them to cancel tickets for the upcoming year. When asked about the apparel in his post-practice press conference interim head coach David Braun suggested that his duty was not to intervene regarding someone’s wardrobe. “My intentionality is going to be solely based on supporting these young men supporting this staff” Braun said. “Certainly isn’t my business to censor anyone’s free speech.” Likewise receiver Bryce Kirtz mentioned that the shirts serve as “a reminder to stick together.” Conversely Northwestern athletic director Derrick Gragg put forth a radically different perspective. Gragg who was seen on the sidelines watching the team’s practice condemned the shirts as “inappropriate offensive and tone deaf.” Gragg also noted that he was not aware that the shirts were in coaches’ possession. Northwestern athletic director Derrick Gragg releases a statement expressing disappointment in the “tone deaf” T-shirts worn by coaches at today’s practice. pic.twitter.com/A6Rrc4FcrU Several Northwestern players including quarterback Brendan Sullivan had posted images and links to purchase the merchandise since July 14. When asked multiple times about players’ or team members’ involvement in their store Davison Michigan-based company Hilton Screeners Inc. declined to provide concrete details. In the short term it’s probable that the shirts will not make further appearances in Evanston — at least not via coaches and not in media members’ presence. Whether any additional disciplinary action is taken by Gragg remains to be seen. NU players decline to answer hazing questions focus solely on season opener in presser On July 25 the day before Big Ten Media Days Kirtz Bryce Gallagher and Rod Heard II issued a statement revealing that they would not be in attendance in Indianapolis. Over two weeks later reporters and fans were finally granted the chance to hear player perspective on Aug. 9. From the jump all three emphasized that hazing would not be a topic of conversation; multiple questions were met with the reiterated response “We’re not here today to talk about any hazing allegations.” Even questions peripherally related to hazing were effectively shot down. For instance the players were asked about hazing’s role in sports to which Heard replied “I don’t think we want to comment on that.” In terms of the events of the last month Gallagher said that the team was “devastated” when Fitzgerald was fired. Yet all three posited that such a situation enabled players to foster closer relationships. “We’ve really just stuck together through all of this” Gallagher said. “Checking in on each other… Especially the younger guys.” Later Gallagher added “The only people that we need are the people in this facility.” Heard echoed the sentiments sharing “They don’t know what’s going on. They can have their opinion.” Further the players reinforced their support for Braun indicating their “full belief” in the first-year head coach. They highlighted that their focus is on preparing to play Rutgers on Sept. 3 and not what transpired from July onward. “I think we’ve just done a great job of moving forward” Heard said. “Looking forward to all the opportunities that we have to go out there on the field.” Wildcats’ QB battle takes shape Wednesday didn’t just provide another critical opportunity to hear from Northwestern’s head coach and players following the development of the team’s hazing scandal. It also enabled reporters to get first glimpses at the 2023 Wildcats as a team. The focal position for NU is unequivocally quarterback — especially in light of very poor play under center since 2020. Braun noted an open quarterback competition at Big Ten Media Days and practice reps furthered that sentiment. Sullivan was the first quarterback to participate in each drill from throwing on the run to screen training to deep ball accuracy to even end zone fades. From there Cincinnati transfer Ben Bryant followed suit with Ryan Hilinski Cole Freeman Jack Lausch and first-year Aidan Gray partaking. Based on their pecking order share of reps and working with top receivers it was apparent that Sullivan and Bryant are the team’s top two quarterbacks. That shouldn’t come as much of a surprise especially given Hilinski’s past struggles — which also manifested themselves in training camp as the grad student’s accuracy was inconsistent. Bajakian and new senior offensive analyst Sean Gleeson watched every dropback and throw of quarterback drills while receivers coach Armon Binns provided pointers to the catchers of such passes including about curl routes ins the scissors concept and fades. Right now Braun seems to be taking somewhat of a hands-off approach to the team’s QB competition entrusting Bajakian with distributing reps. The coach mentioned he’s seen “really good things” from Sullivan and Bryant. Northwestern fans shouldn’t expect to have a starter named until at least late August which has become a familiar refrain. Nonetheless Braun noted that “Whoever earns that starting role is going to be the best version of himself because he’s been pushed to compete.” Positive injury news Following a season-ending leg injury at Minnesota on Nov. 12 2022 Hilinski was able to participate in practice with a leg sleeve on. That’s definitely good news especially considering he was unable to do so in the spring. Additionally defensive back Coco Azema and defensive lineman Jaylen Pate engaged in drills subsequent to suffering injuries that cut their 2022 seasons short. Regarding recent injuries first-year tight end Camp Magee did not participate in Wednesday’s practice riding a bike and tossing around ropes on the sideline. Moreover sophomore running back Joseph Himon II received attention on his left ankle missing several drills. All in all Braun and the Wildcats are likely very content with the health of the team in the early stages of camp. New faces/schemes getting acclimated In an offseason of tremendous turbulence Northwestern’s own roster is dotted with some unfamiliar names to Wildcat fans. At receiver NU added Michigan’s A.J. Henning and Arizona State’s Cam Johnson following several departures at wideout. Kirtz one of few veteran returners shared his experience with both newcomers. “It’s been great having them in the room” Kirtz said. “We’ve definitely helped each other out on the field.” The senior specified working together in blocking and route-running. It can be easy to forget but Braun himself is a newcomer — including to the FBS/Power Five level. With the former North Dakota State DC now Northwestern’s head coach and defensive coordinator he’ll implement a new system by which veteran ‘Cat defenders seem to feel encouraged. “There’s definitely similarities and differences [to the past]” Gallagher said. “We’re really excited to keep mastering that during training camp.” Heard added “I think he’s done a great job of trying to create more opportunities for the players.” \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story What’s missing for NMSOC to win? Northwestern men’s soccer has all the tools to be a competitive program and fight for a top seed in the Big Ten. Yet this season could mark the 10th consecutive season in which the program has failed to reach the NCAA Tournament a grim record the ‘Cats want to eclipse. Fresh off a victory at the CONCACAF Nations League where he served as an assistant coach for the USMNT head coach Russell Payne will be eager to instill a winning mentality to his players. Here are some of the main questions Northwestern will have to answer this season:  Third time the charm? As mentioned in the intro it’s been a very long time since NU made the NCAA Tournament. When Russell Payne was announced as the new head coach in 2021 there is no doubt the school had in mind this tournament drought which has been plaguing the program for years.  This fall will mark Payne’s third season as head coach and many will hope that this is the year the school can compete in the most prestigious collegiate soccer competition. There have been some positives in his first two seasons with Northwestern making it to the semifinal of the Big Ten Tournament in 2021 after a surprise upset against two-seeded Maryland. That same Maryland team took out the ‘Cats last season in what seems to have become an annual rivalry.  Payne has now had the time to implement his system and create a distinct playing style. Previously the head coach at West Point it took Payne four seasons for his team to boast a winning record and many hope he’ll be able to replicate his success in Evanston in even quicker fashion.  However small steps are needed for this to happen. After struggling yet again with an overall 3-5-2 record (only one win in the Big Ten) it is mandatory for the team to win more conference games. A pleasing spring season including a win against UIC and a full preseason with new recruits can lead to a few more wins and a possible NCAA Tournament berth. Who’s going to step up to the challenge? With three exhibition games (at Marquette Aug. 11 vs. IUPUI Aug. 13 and vs. Western Michigan Aug. 18) Payne will have ample time to decide on his first 11 for the season opener against St. Thomas. With about 10 players from last season’s roster leaving the program major decisions will have to be made and every player will have the opportunity to showcase to their coach why they deserve to be on the team sheet come Aug. 24. Some of the most notable departures are that of Ethan Dudley Vicente Castro and Bardia Kimiavi.  Dudley arrived as a graduate student last season and the center back made an instant impact notching four goals (the most on the team) and starting in all 17 games. NU will heavily rely on sophomore center back Nigel Prince to lead in defense. His possible center-back partner Henri Richter will also look to leave his mark on the team having not played his first year.  Castro was Northwestern’s main creative outlet for the past three years. The Chilean has tallied an impressive 16 assists and five goals over his NU career. Payne can turn to Jayvin Van Deventer to succeed Castro in his role. Van Deventer a four-star recruit will be a sophomore but accumulated a lot of playing time last season logging 682 minutes and starting the ‘Cats’ last three games.  Kimiavi has been a standout player during his collegiate career with Northwestern. The tricky winger has played 79 times over five seasons. His experience and leadership will be missed in the locker room as well as his impact on the field. There are a few players that can use his departure as an opportunity to step up such as Paul Son who started four games last season. Forward Christopher Taggard will also hope to impress in the preseason and find a spot in Payne’s plans having started five games (one goal) last year.  The rising sophomore will also be competing for a spot with forwards Joe Arena and Justin Weiss who will both be established seniors. A lot depends on Payne’s choice of formation which points to be either a 4-4-2 or 4-2-3-1. Can the new recruits make an instant impact? A total of 14 players will join Northwestern in the fall a hefty number of arrivals to compensate for the loss of almost a dozen players. It will be interesting to see how they fit into Payne’s system during preseason and the three exhibition games.  A battle for the starting keeper spot has already begun. Jackson Weymann an Evanston local made his way back to E-Town as a graduate student after playing for Marquette and University of South Florida. Having already been with he team during spring season he is already acclimated to the squad and has the upper hand for the starting goalkeeper position. He will be competing with Rafael Ponce de León who could very well impress in preseason and get his hands on that No. 1 spot. Coming from Villanova where he did not see any gametime Ponce de León swapped one Wildcat for another and will look to see some minutes on the field at NU. An alite prospect coming out of high school he was named MLS Next Best Goalkeeper 2020-2021 and All-American Best XI 2021-2022.  Some other interesting recruits include 6-foot-4 freshman goalkeeper Jude Bosshardt. In defense a pair of brothers in Reese and Bryant Mayer are joining the ‘Cats along with Fritz Volmar and Owen Noverr.  In midfield new additions include Hungarian midfielder Peter Riesz Glencoe native James Spatzek and three-star recruit Tyler Glassberg.  Finally three incoming first-years will join the team up front. The first is Kai Reis who won the MLS Next Conference Championships with LA Galaxy Academy in 2021 and 2022. He’ll be joined by Italo Addimandi who last featured for Inter Miami II and Gregory Cook who won a national championship with New England Revolution U19.  Additionally graduate student Ugo Achara Jr. will return to the program. He played for the Wildcats as a freshman and sophomore before joining Louisville for two seasons. Achara who hopes to add to his seven goals for the ‘Cats will add much needed experience to the team and can mentor a large group of freshman forwards. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story As we continue to prepare for the 2023 season today we’ll examine Northwestern’s defensive line which struggled last year — and looks radically different for the year ahead. Returning Starters: Sean McLaughlin (Sr.) Aidan Hubbard (Jr.) Key Losses: Adetomiwa Adebawore (NFL Draft Indianapolis Colts) Henrik Barndt (graduation) Ryan Johnson (graduation) Devin O’Rourke (graduation) Taishan Holmes (UDFA) Jordan Butler (transfer portal) Jason Gold Jr. (transfer Texas State) Austin Firestone (transfer Missouri) Returners: Najee Story (Jr.) P.J. Spencer (Sr.) Jaiden Cameron (Sr.) Carmine Bastone (Jr.) Peyton Warford (So.) Jaylen Pate (Gr.) Anto Saka (So.) Brendan Flakes (So.) Newcomers: Richie Hagarty (Grad transfer Southern Illinois) Matthew Lawson (Grad transfer Fresno State) Reginald Pearson (Grad transfer Bethune-Cookman) Tyler Gant (Fy.) Michael Kilbane (Fy.) Dylan Roberts (Fy.) Whew that’s a lot of names... Especially in that second section. It makes it easy to see that this unit’s turnover appears to be its biggest challenge heading into 2023. Not only did the D-line get hit harder than any other position group on the team when it came to outgoing transfers and graduates it also lost its coach in Marty Long. Christian Smith and David Braun will fill the shoes of Long and former defensive coordinator Jim O’Neil who were both fired last November. The new crop of D-linemen that Smith and Braun are tasked with developing have its work cut out for them. Looking at nearly every metric Northwestern struggled mightily against the run in 2022. And that was with a star player in Adebawore who was the team’s best defensive player last year.  The grad transfers — particularly Hagarty and Lawson — will almost certainly be very key to any success the defense enjoys. In order for the line to improve those two will need to take on a ton of snaps and give McLaughlin some support up front. That’ll make it a little easier for linemen whose snap counts could take massive jumps to transition into larger roles. Key Player Najee Story Story who played in every game last year is the beacon of continuity for a group that needs it. Whether that means a lot or a little it’s definitely a positive that Northwestern has someone stepping into a starting role who has seen the field extensively already. Beyond that Story’s a versatile player and his athleticism has allowed him to play from a couple of different spots up front. Chances are that the rising junior moves inside in 2023 given he bulked up from at least 250 pounds to 285 since last fall according to Northwestern’s spring roster. Plus assuming Braun sticks with the 4-3 scheme he ran at North Dakota State the exodus of nose tackles leaves a spot open next to Lawson.  With fewer players in front of him on the depth chart Story will have to maintain that versatility while also generating a consistent three-down push on bigger guards and centers. If he can that could free up McLaughlin and others in a variety of ways and set the defensive line up for a little bit of success. Story should easily play enough to best his 25-tackle mark from 2022 but that can’t be the only sign of improvement as he transitions into an every-down role. Big Question How much of an impact will Richie Hagarty and Matt Lawson make from the jump? I wrote it above and I’ll write it again: the grad transfers could determine how far the D-line goes more than any returning players will. It’s relatively inexperienced when it comes to playing time and Lawson and Hagarty have played in a combined 50 games by themselves. For Braun who’s helping younger returners adapt to a new scheme after they studied O’Neil’s for years (even though Braun’s maintaining some of JON’s elements) it’s critical to have players with on-field experience who can soften the learning curve.  Obviously relying on grad transfers to secure starting roles isn’t new for Northwestern; Ryan Johnson and Taishan Holmes were in Hagarty and Lawson’s shoes last year. However with much less depth across the line both inside and outside the 2023 additions could need to spearhead the pass rush and the run defense alongside McLaughlin. Hagarty played on the edge at SIU and racked up 6.5 sacks for the Salukis last year. Lawson is likely set to work on the interior. There’s a decent shot both players take on the most snaps in those areas out of everyone besides McLaughlin and Hubbard. For NU to generate early in-game momentum defensively — something it almost always failed to do even in the games that were close — Hagarty and Lawson have to play huge roles in driving the change from the moment Northwestern touches down in Piscataway. Both will likely have the early opportunities to but it will be intriguing to see how they take on what will be an accelerated transition to Big Ten competition. \nDepth Chart (according to ourlads.com)\n \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Continuing our way through player previews for the Northwestern women’s soccer team we find ourselves taking a look at Ingrid Falls. The forward out of Lake Forest Illinois is entering her fourth year with the team and fresh off a career high in games played in 2022 she seems ready to attack the latest campaign. Who she is Senior; forward; 5-foot-7; from Lake Forest Illinois; played on the No. 4 club team in the country in 2019 played with Bridget Mitchell and Nicole Doucette since U8 team. Career Stats 30.4 minutes per game; four goals; one assist; nine points; 70.6% shots on goal. 2022-2023 review Falls’ 2022 campaign was one headlined by career highs. She notched personal records in minutes assists shots and games played.  Falls boasted a near full-game appearance against SIUE in the NCAA Tournament tallying 87 minutes and a goal in the process. The then-junior also fired off three shots in the same postseason game — tied for the most in a single match in her time at NU. In 22 games Falls averaged just under 28 minutes a contest. She used her time on the field to tally two goals and an assist good for five points. Often coming off the bench Falls packed a punch when it mattered. Her sole assist on the year catalyzed the game-winning goal against Vanderbilt in the second leg of the NCAA Tourney. Expectations Heading into what could be her final season — depending on whether or not she opts in for a grad year — Falls has a stage set for success. Having not seen the field in her freshman year the forward hasn’t had the chance to max out her potential like some of her teammates. She’s seen her usage hover around 30 minutes per game in the last two seasons and seniority coupled with another offseason of training leaves the door open for that figure to climb in 2023. Falls earned the starting badge in a total of nine games over the last two years signaling that there’s plenty of belief in her potential among the team’s coaching staff. Falls joined the team as a first-year in 2020 a member of a COVID-19-impacted recruiting class that now flexes an abundance of team staples. As she embarks on what could be her final season in Evanston there’s no telling what Falls could do. She’s experienced limited playing time in the past but has demonstrated a knack for the ball when she’s near it. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Following the conclusion of a dreary 10-40 season Northwestern baseball’s offseason has been fraught with continued chaos. That turmoil has only grown further in the last week. According to multiple sources close to the Northwestern baseball program including current and recent former players athletic director Derrick Gragg met with acting head coach Brian Anderson on Monday and informed the assistant coach that he would not be NU’s head coach for the 2024 season — and that an external national search for candidates would occur. One source that spoke to Inside NU was told the news directly by Anderson himself. Moreover these sources shared that Gragg or any other member of Northwestern’s athletic department never disseminated the news of not hiring Anderson to the team. In fact the players that were contacted by Anderson himself relayed the information to teammates in a group text chat in an effort to spread the message. According to two players the team indicated its support of Anderson to be Northwestern’s next head coach in a July 17 meeting — the first after the “indefinite suspension” of Jim Foster — with one noting it was “just about unanimously” in favor of Anderson. A player shared that NU’s athletic department was “having us operating under the assumption” that Anderson would be the head coach for 2024. “He’s a guy who’s been around” a player said of Anderson. “He’s a guy who we know. He would be a fantastic coach. And we know he has our backs. We know that he’s somebody who we can trust.” Another current player who was recruited by Anderson echoed similar sentiments expressing his desire for Anderson to be the head coach because he “seems like a great leader who wants to get the program going in the right direction.” It is unclear whether Anderson will remain with the Wildcats in any coaching capacity. Multiple sources revealed that Gragg sent an email to players on Aug. 3 in which the AD wrote to “check on you given all that has been going on in Wildcat Nation.” Despite other scandals at Northwestern Gragg affirmed that he has “still been able to focus on our baseball program and other areas” despite “unforeseen events that have required a lot of my attention” adding that he would “look forward to sharing more news soon.” Inside NU obtained a picture of this email with one player mentioning it was the last he had heard from Gragg. Players discussed their ongoing anger at little messaging from athletic administration despite efforts to get in contact with leadership. “They ignore calls ignore emails texts” a current player said adding that the department is “functioning right now with the sole purpose of keeping mouths shut.” When asked about the mood from players regarding the athletic department a recent former player referred to it as “complete uncertainty.” In the wake of Foster’s “indefinite suspension” on July 13 Gragg announced that Anderson “will take leadership of the program.” Anderson a former first-round MLB Draft pick was first hired by the Wildcats on March 28 after two prior assistants had departed the team following the start of the 2023 season. One current player called the language utilized by Gragg in the announcement of Anderson’s initial promotion as “slimy and intentional” with Anderson never technically being referred to as the team’s interim head coach. Inside NU reached out to Northwestern for comment about the decision not to hire Anderson as well as not informing players through leadership but did not hear back at the time of publication. Editor’s Note: Several hours after publishing this story university spokesperson Jon Yates shared a statement with Inside NU noting that Northwestern’s athletic department “provides updates as appropriate.” Yates also verified the date and contents of the aforementioned email from Gragg. Regarding Anderson Yates said that the coach will “remain in charge...during this transitional period.” In that July 17 meeting players noted that an emphasis was placed on “transparency” with regard to the program’s search for a head coach and that Gragg would defer to the team’s desires for its new leader. “He [Gragg] went on to assure us that we’ve been heard” a current player said. After players were notified of the decision not to move forward with Anderson via their teammates they were “caught off guard” and “sick of being misled.” “It’s not so much ‘Oh we wish this guy was head coach and this guy wasn’t’ a player said. “It’s more of just ‘This mistreatment from the administration is getting insanely old.’” Including the upcoming 2024 campaign Northwestern will now have had four head baseball coaches in the last four seasons. When asked if they trust the university’s leadership to pick a competent and qualified head coach two players expressed doubt. “Absolutely not” a current player said underscoring the very late nature of the hiring cycle. The recent former player noted that he would feel confident in the athletic department’s vetting process in “normal circumstances” but that “it doesn’t seem like they’re thinking about baseball at all.” As for what the players would like to see Gragg and the university do two indicated that hiring Anderson even for one year is in the program’s best interest. “It takes more than just half a summer to get somebody to uproot their life and come to Chicago” the former player said. “You’re probably not going to find the best candidate or most qualified coach. We kind of saw that happen last year.” “I think they would have to take BA at this point” a current player stressed. “How can we be okay with letting that go with hopes of potentially finding someone a little bit better? That doesn’t really make much sense to a lot of us.” Despite players’ wishes it appears that Northwestern will indeed hire an outside head coach before the start of the 2024 season. Per reports from MLB Network’s J.P. Morosi NU has interest in head coaching candidates with ties to the school including former New York Yankees and Philadelphia Phillies manager Joe Girardi former Chicago Cubs bench coach Mark Loretta and Chicago White Sox Director of Youth Baseball Mike Huff. Other names to have been floated by Morosi are White Sox assistant general manager Chris Getz Michigan associate head coach Ben Greenspan Pepperdine assistant Danny Worth and Washburn pitching coach Shaun Marcum. As for compiling a new staff in August a source close to the team deemed the decision not to hire Anderson a “joke” adding “Admin is just tying one arm behind our backs and hoping we can be successful.” \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Two weeks away from its season opener in Hawaii Northwestern volleyball will look very different from the last time it took the court. The ‘Cats lost seven of their last eight to close out the 2022 season knocking them out of contention to make the NCAA Tournament. NU also finished 7-13 in Big Ten play for the second year in a row which is tied for its best Big Ten season under head coach Shane Davis. The Wildcats suffered heavy losses this offseason losing three prominent figures in Desiree Becker Hanna Lesiak and All-American Temi Thomas-Ailara. To replenish its losses Northwestern brought in seven new faces to round out its squad.  The pressure is mounting on Davis who was named in a lawsuit over hazing allegations which were corroborated by multiple former players to Inside NU. Davis who had tremendous success with the men’s volleyball program at Loyola Chicago has yet to show he can be a successful Big Ten women’s volleyball coach. The ‘Cats have yet to get over the hump with Davis at the helm and will have to prove that their reloaded roster is up to the gauntlet of a Big Ten schedule. Right now there are many questions surrounding NU Volleyball and here are three that should define the Wildcats 2023 season. Where does the offense come from? For the past four seasons every time the Wildcats stepped onto the floor it was Temi time. Thomas-Ailara was as dominant as any player in the country and singlehandedly kept the ‘Cats in games or willed them to victory. In 2022 she led the entire Big Ten with 502 kills and her 1546 career kills puts her fifth in Northwestern history. She was completely dominant with opposing teams having no answer when a ball came off No. 12’s hands. Alongside TTA Lesiak was second with nearly 300 kills and Becker added another 177 kills of her own. The trio combined for roughly 62% of NU’s kills on the season so making up for all of that firepower has to be priority 1A for the Wildcats during the preseason. With so much of the offense gone who steps up for the Wildcats will be the deciding factor in how their season goes. Former Ohio Gatorade Player of the Year Kathryn Randorf will be at the forefront of the revamped Wildcats’ attack.  Randorf who had 256 kills last year and was named to the All-Big Ten Freshman Team is expected to slide into the starting lineup this season and continue to develop into one of the conference’s top attackers.   Sophomore Averie Hernandez will also see an increase in minutes this season as she looks to find her footing at the collegiate level. Hernandez only played in 13 matches but showed her offense prowess in high school notching over 1000 kills. Furthermore expect Leilani Dotson and transfers Maddie Chinn Julia Sangiacomo and Rylen Reid to chip in and help the ‘Cats score this upcoming season. Replacing TTA is nearly impossible but if NU can get contributions from across the board it can be competitive against top Big Ten opponents. Can the ‘Cats limit the number of mistakes? Watching Northwestern last year it felt like the Wildcats were often shooting themselves in the foot. NU had numerous unforced errors each game. Whether it was a serve into the net or an errant pass Northwestern seemed to gift its opponents points every match. The Wildcats had about 70 more attacking errors than their opponents. In close games against superior teams the ‘Cats need to play clean volleyball if it wants to pull off upsets. Northwestern also had more ball-handling errors and reception errors than its opponents. These mistakes would often allow opponents to go on long scoring streaks and put sets away before the Wildcats even had a chance to make it competitive so halting these long streaks is something the ‘Cats need to do more often this upcoming season. The way to do it is to stop gifting opponents points and make them earn each set. If Northwestern can play clean matches this season it has the talent to compete in the Big Ten. How will an influx of new talent affect Northwestern? ""With NU bringing in seven new players including five transfers the ‘Cats will have to mesh and find their rhythm playing together. Players will have to learn how to communicate what everyones strengths are and in general how to play together. Sure it is easy to do in practice; however it is much harder when the bullets are flying at game speed. "" Furthermore the Wildcats need their new faces to make an instant impact on the team in order to have a successful season. If last season showed anything is that depth is needed. At the end of the season NU was playing without a setter due to injuries to Alexa Rousseau and Sienna Noordermeer so Davis brought in Lauren Carter from Denver to ensure that injuries could not derail a season again. The ‘Cats brought in multiple outside hitters to round out their attack but each of them will have to adapt to how the ball comes out of Rousseau’s Noordermeer’s and Carter’s hands. With Megan Miller gone first-year Gigi Navarrete will have to be ready to go in and dig out balls firing off some of the best attackers in the nation which will not an easy adjustment from high school. Northwestern will need all six women to play significant sets if the ‘Cats finally want to get over the hump and make it to the NCAA Tournament. The pressure is immense but Northwestern has the pieces to be a good team. Now it just has to put it all together. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1

Share this story As we inch closer to Northwestern’s season opener against Rutgers on Sept. 3 today we shine a light on the cornerstones of the Wildcats’ defense: the linebackers. Overview Returning Starters: Bryce Gallagher (R-Sr.) Xander Mueller (R-Jr.) Greyson Metz (R- Jr.) Key Losses: Wendell Davis Jr. Declan Carr Khalid Jones Returning members: Braydon Brus (R-Fy.) Kenny Soares Jr. (R-Fy.) Mac Uihlein (R-So.) Jason Reynolds II (R-Fy.) Cullen Coleman (R-Jr.) Owen Bergin (R-Jr.) Miles Crutchley (R-Fy.) New additions: None (First-years Justin Cryer and Nigel Glover transferred after the termination of Pat Fitzgerald) Northwestern returns its entire starting linebacker group from last season bringing a heavy amount of experience at the helm of the ‘Cats’ defense. Gallagher and Mueller led the squad in tackles last year racking up a combined 187 total tackles on the year. The tandem additionally created four turnovers. The duo made up two of the few bright spots on Jim O’Neil’s defense in 2022 and should continue to thrive under David Braun. The ‘Cats will run Braun’s 4-3 defense this season meaning three linebackers will be on the field. Based on the snap count from last season Metz would be the odds-on favorite to be the final linebacker in the starting trio; however Uihlein showed some flashes last season and if he has a strong camp could compete for the starting job. Braun has talked about using a defensive back in the box instead of a third linebacker to alleviate the linebackers’ responsibility in pass coverage and allow them to play more downhill in the run game an area in which the ‘Cats’ backers thrive.  For Northwestern its linebackers can only be as successful as its defensive line allows them to be. The Wildcats’ D-line will need to eat blocks and ensure that the linebackers remain free to plug gaps and make plays on the ball carriers. Gallagher and Mueller understand run fits extremely well but none of that matters if opposing offensive linemen are getting free passes to the second level and getting their hands on the linebackers either forcing the backers to take a bad angle or completely washing them out of the play. Key Player Bryce Gallagher Not surprising that NU’s starting mike linebacker leading tackler and captain would be the player to watch out of the group. Gallagher was one of the three Wildcats to be named All-Big Ten last season joining NFL draft picks Peter Skoronski and Adetomiwa Adebawore. No. 32 was all over the field for Northwestern in 2022 being the only player to reach triple-digit tackles. Five of his tackles went for losses and he also added 1.5 sacks to his accolades as well. According to PFF he added a QB hit and six hurries too.  While Gallagher was good in the run defense and pass rush he was horrid in coverage. He earned a meager 46.2 PFF pass coverage grade. He allowed completions on over two-thirds of targets giving up over 16 yards per reception. The Wildcats’ captain struggled to play sideline to sideline and could not keep up with the speed of the running backs and spread tight ends he was asked to cover.  He is the definition of an old-school Big Ten linebacker still wearing a neck roll as he tries to blow up the hole. He is a battering ram flying downhill with no regard for human life and hits with tenacity. He is a tremendous run stopper but needs to improve drastically against the pass if he wants to become a complete player. Gallagher told Big Ten Network that he has lost a few pounds and feels more fluid playing from sideline to sideline so he has already taken steps to improve in the area of need. Furthermore Gallagher will be responsible for leading and communicating a new defensive scheme on the field. As a middle linebacker it is his responsibility to make sure the D-Line is aligned correctly before the snap and relay the call to his teammates in the back end. Coach Braun has complimented Bryce’s leadership skills multiple times this offseason so expect the rising senior to be at the forefront as the Wildcats try to emerge from a nightmare of an offseason. Key Question  Can the ‘Cats defend against the pass? If you watched any Northwestern game last season it seemed that opposing tight ends and running backs had free rein over the field. Jim O’Neil’s scheme left the Wildcats with unfavorable matchups every week and pitted the linebackers against players who were blatantly more athletic than them in open space. It was less than ideal for the Wildcats. The starting trio allowed nearly 78% of passes to be completed for over 10 yards a catch. With David Braun now at the helm of the ‘Cats’ defense the question remains: What will NU do to fix this issue? It would be irresponsible to assume that in nine months both Gallagher and Mueller have made significant improvement in this area and will now be lockdown when the ball is in the air. Northwestern will have to limit the number of snaps that both players have to leave the box and cover swing backs or athletic tight ends in space but taking them off the field seems like a risky option. While Braun’s base system is a 4-3 it is safe to assume that the ‘Cats will use a nickel package and bring an extra defensive back onto the field hoping to tighten the coverage in obvious passing situations. If the Wildcats decide to use a nickel corner it allows the linebackers to engage more in the pass rush where NU definitely needs help without a bonafide edge rusher.  During training camp Northwestern will have to come up with a game plan to not leave its linebackers on an island or else the Wildcats will face the same problem that created deficits they could not overcome in 2022. \nDepth Chart (according to ourlads.com)\n      \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The rising senior accumulated an incredible amount of playing experience over her first three seasons and has proven time after time her ability to rise to and shine in the most pressure-packed situations.  Who is she? Senior; goalkeeper; from Houston Texas Career Stats 3629 minutes over 61 games; 244 saves; 69 goals allowed allows 1.14 goals on average; .780 save percentage; 10 shutouts; 45-15 win-loss record.   2022 Review Experience longevity talent — Annabel Skubisz embodies all of these. She quickly made a name for herself in 2020 playing in 16 of 18 games and starting 14 while posting 65 saves and four shutouts. Then in her sophomore season Skubisz led the ‘Cats to a national title and her role in the program’s first-ever championship can’t be overstated. She started 20 games and had the second-most minutes on the team but being an underclassman seemed to have no effect on her even on the game’s biggest stage. Across the four NCAA games against North Carolina Iowa Harvard and Liberty she recorded nine saves and allowed only one goal to Harvard in the semifinals.  ""In the 2022 season she was of course stellar once again leading NU to its second consecutive championship game. She had the most minutes of not just any Wildcat but of anything goalkeeper in the nation also totaling 111 saves — the most by a NU keeper since 2008 and 43 more than in her previous season. Skubiszs talent especially was clear in her five shoutouts with four coming against top 20 teams in No. 18 Duke No. 14 Boston College and No. 11 Liberty and No. 6 Michigan. "" While Northwestern didn’t hoist the trophy at the end of the season Skubisz had noteworthy NCAA outings that shouldn’t go ignored— perhaps a product of her tournament experience or just because she is that good. The first two games of the tournament went into shootouts with Skubisz allowing just one goal in each and recording five saves against No. 25 Miami Ohio and four against No. 11 Iowa. Against the RedHawks the Texan even forced three missed penalty shots.  In the Final Four she had five saves against No. 2 Maryland and allowed one goal. North Carolina may have come out on top in the final minute to claim the championship but it was one of Skubisz’s best performances. She surrendered only two goals to one of the most storied programs in field hockey —not to mention the final shot coming from none other than Erin Matson arguably the best field hockey player ever — and put up seven saves one of which came off a Matson penalty stroke.  Expectations  For a goalie of this caliber Skubisz is quite honestly underrated. She’s as good if not better than any other goalie in the nation. With such a talented team especially one featuring Bente Baekers the keeper position may go overlooked but Skubisz can be the difference and often has. Especially last season when Northwestern got behind early or went into overtime Skubisz was a crucial piece in giving the Wildcats a fighting chance. That will continue into this year. If Skubisz is solid the ‘Cats are solid. She has two straight seasons that ended in a title game and she’s started every NCAA game that she’s seen as a Wildcat. She’ll be defending the goal in just about every game for as long as possible given that health permits and the game is stowed away. Maybe the best way to sum up the expectations for Skubisz is to say that she’ll probably be slotting her name into the Northwestern record book a few times this season. In some ways it seems Annabel Skubisz may be the heart of this team.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hampton on the outside a little easier. Share this story We continue our overviews of each Northwestern football position group with one of the deeper ones: the defensive backs. With its top two cornerbacks now gone the Sky Team is a group in transition. But it’s an experienced one. Overview Returning starters: Coco Azema (Sr.) Rod Heard II (Sr.) Key losses: Cameron Mitchell (NFL Cleveland Browns) A.J. Hampton Jr. (Transfer portal Tulane) Jeremiah Lewis (Transfer portal Duke) Trent Carrington (Graduation) Tyler Haskins (Transfer portal Bryant) Returners: Jaheem Joseph (Sr.) Garnett Hollis Jr. (Sr.) Theran Johnson (Jr.) Devin Turner (So.) Nigel Williams (Sr.) Ore Adeyi (Jr.) Garner Wallace (Jr.) Robert Fitzgerald (So.) Joe DeHaan (Sr.) Evan Smith (So.) Jack Oyola (Sr.) Braden Turner (So.) Newcomers: Damon Walters (Fy.) Joshua Fussell (Fy.) J.J. Lewis (Fy.) Cole Shivers (Fy.) Most of Northwestern’s position rooms are either undergoing a massive reset (i.e. defensive line) or returning the bulk of its 2022 starting core (see: the linebackers). The DBs fall somewhere in the middle. On one hand the Wildcats will get 2021 starting safety Coco Azema back from injury after he played only three games last year. Azema may be the best — and most versatile — player on the entire team and Rod Heard II stepped up late in the 2022 season as a solid slot corner. However Northwestern is going to lose its top three defensive backs in Cameron Mitchell A.J. Hampton and Jeremiah Lewis. That’s never easy especially considering that Mitchell and Hampton started on the outside for not one but two seasons.  It’s not like this group is inexperienced though. Jaheem Joseph Garnett Hollis Jr. Devin Turner and Theran Johnson have all made spot starts at one point or another. With some more upperclassmen in the fold the secondary could still end up being one of the team’s deepest position groups despite losing so many key pieces. Experience means little without production though. Ultimately this year’s secondary will be less talented than the 2022 group which finished a very respectable 47th nationally in defensive estimated points added (EPA) per pass. With NFL-bound cornerbacks coach Ryan Smith out and LaMarcus Hicks in — not to mention the installation of David Braun’s defense — there are brand-new schematic and technical elements that the corners need to master. They’ll have to do so quickly to set a tone for a defense that’s in need of dynamic playmakers at all three levels. Key Player Rod Heard II Heard did it all last season from taking snaps at safety to serving as an extra linebacker at times. That Swiss Army knife role could remain similar only this time with Heard as a centerpiece of the entire secondary. In one world he could be Northwestern’s undisputed CB1 this fall. In another the rising senior could function as Braun’s rover. Maybe he’ll be both of those things depending on the package. No matter how Braun chooses to deploy Heard his success in adapting to an even bigger role will be a decent indicator of how the entire defense will fare. In 2021 when Heard’s snap count took its first massive jump after he became a starting cornerback he struggled early and eventually lost his spot. Fortunately this wasn’t the case in 2022 as he started every game and improved as the season went on. Heard has proven that he can excel against anyone; one can argue that his best game last season came against Ohio State when he racked up six tackles and a pass breakup. He flashed his physicality in coverage against elite Buckeye receivers which also highlighted the quality that makes him a strong run defender. If Heard can showcase that versatility from the jump NU will have a player who can plug in multiple holes seamlessly.  Given that Azema also thrives against the run Heard could also allow Braun to get very creative in dialing up looks with two defensive backs who can line up inside the box. Should Heard slot in as a linebacker he could also help take stress off Bryce Gallagher Xander Mueller and Grayson Metz in intermediate coverage. Jim O’Neil was about as good at doing that in 2022 as Charlie Brown is at kicking a football. Ultimately for a defense that is severely lacking in depth at most spots Heard’s skillset could be invaluable if he proves to be a capable starter at multiple positions. Big Question Who will start at safety opposite Coco Azema? Six weeks ago this question didn’t exist. In fact the apparent certainty of Azema and Jeremiah Lewis forming a safety duo was among Northwestern’s biggest strengths. Then Pat Fitzgerald got fired and Lewis transferred back to Duke where he played the first four seasons of his collegiate career. Of course Lewis’s decision leaves a massive hole next to Azema that is now up for grabs.  Heard started at safety a few times last year but Braun may need him to fill a more important position depending on how everything else shakes out. That likely leaves Devin Turner and Jaheem Joseph as the prime candidates to start. Joseph was projected to fill that role in 2022 but he only played in two games before suffering a season-ending injury. On the other hand Turner started three games and played in eight last year as a true first-year. Turner is also a pretty versatile player who can take snaps in the slot and outside so this may boil down to how healthy NU remains down the stretch to maintain its depth. The injury bug ravaged Northwestern last September as Hampton Joseph and Azema all got hurt early on. If Braun can start Turner at safety without having to plug new holes elsewhere then the competition for the starting role should only last until Sept. 3. However if Northwestern’s injury luck doesn’t improve — or if whoever the starter is bears the brunt of a difficult September schedule — then players like Ore Adeyi and Garner Wallace could come into the mix a little more than expected. \nDepth Chart (per ourlads.com)\n \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story As we inch further and further into August sports fans everywhere can feel it coming. Everyone knows that the sweltering heat of summer is about to give way to something different something that will bring us immense joy but also frustrate us immensely. Mark your calendars for three weeks from today because that’s when we shift from summer not to fall but to football season as Northwestern kicks off against Rutgers. Heading into the 2023 campaign the ‘Cats’ roster looks a lot different than it did last year. Despite being a bottom feeder in the Big Ten NU lost a lot of talent to the NFL Draft. Leading rusher and team leader Evan Hull is gone. So is first-round pick Peter Skoronski who anchored the left side of Northwestern’s offensive line. The defense lost Adetomiwa Adebawore and Cameron Mitchell to the pros as well. The transfer portal also shaped this roster. The ‘Cats added talent at receiver and quarterback in presumptive starters A.J. Henning and Ben Bryant. But they also lost Malik Washington A.J. Hampton and others in the portal. Today we’re going to take a look at the players still in Evanston who were most impacted by this transfer season and who have to step up this year as a result. WR Bryce Kirtz Kirtz had 19 receptions in 2022 for 212 yards and no touchdowns. These numbers remained similar to his totals from 2021. The lack of statistical improvement isn’t necessarily his fault though. Remember who was throwing him the ball. The Northwestern passing attack was abysmal and Kirtz was stuck behind Washington and Donny Navarro III on the depth chart.  Washington’s departure for UVA should give Kirtz an opportunity to show improvement. Yes the ‘Cats brought in Cam Johnson and A.J. Henning but neither are clear heirs to Washington’s production. With a competent passer at the helm Kirtz will be right in the mix. Johnson and Henning are real threats and there are other names on the receiver depth chart like Preston Bacon who could be factors in this offense. But Kirtz has been in Evanston the longest and seems poised to have an increased target share. CB Garnett Hollis Jr. Hollis Jr. saw the field plenty in 2022 and was especially impressive against Duke after injuries pressed him into service but Hampton and Cameron Mitchell were both entrenched starters. This year the Nashville native will likely start games for the ‘Cats and get a chance to show everyone what he’s capable of. Hollis is a former three star recruit with size and length who played basketball in high school. According to his 247Sports page his ball skills are also a strength. If Hampton had stayed with the program there would have been a lot of guys fighting for Mitchell’s spot. Now with two spots open Hollis has a golden opportunity to solidify himself as a power five starter in 2023. On the flip side his leash will be short. The cornerback position is in extreme flux right now and should Hollis struggle at any point he will have to watch his back. Names like Theran Johnson Ore Adeyi and Devin Turner will all be competing for snaps. QB Brendan Sullivan Incoming transfers can also put pressure on returning players. Sullivan likely would have started for the ‘Cats this year if Ben Bryant had not entered the picture. It’s a difficult break for Sully who struggled at times as a starter but showed off his rushing ability and some swagger in 2022. In some ways Bryant’s arrival takes the pressure off of Sullivan. He gets another year to sit watch absorb and learn. If the junior wants to start for this program down the road then coaches have to see him improving as a passer. We saw last year that Sullivan is not a Big Ten quality thrower of the football at the moment. He needs to improve and while Bryant’s presence hurts him in the immediate there is a path for Sully to prove something this season internally. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Continuing our way through player previews for the Northwestern women’s soccer team we’ll move on to Meg Boade. On Aug. 11 United Soccer Coaches released their 2023 Midfielders to Watch list; unsurprisingly Boade was included. A rising senior No. 34 will look to build off a successful junior year as the ‘Cats attempt to make it to the Elite Eight for the first time in program history. Who is she? Senior; midfielder; from Lone Tree Colorado 2022 First Team All-Big Ten and United Soccer Coaches All-North Region honoree Career Stats 48 games played 34 starts; eight goals; three assists; 19 points 2022 Review 2022 was a breakout year for Boade as she scored seven goals and notched two assists en route to the ‘Cats journey to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2018. After playing just 959 minutes over her first two seasons in Evanston Boade entered 2023 as a bonafide starter making the XI in all 23 contests. She was everywhere on the pitch in those appearances whether it be dropping back to stymie a counter attack or dancing through the opponent’s eighteen with the ball practically glued to her feet. No passing lane was safe from Boade’s aggressive defending. Having her on the ball inspired confidence in the Northwestern attack as the potential for something great was always tangible. Despite lower counting statistics than others around the conference Boade’s commanding presence as a quintessential central midfielder earned her First Team All-Big Ten accolades. Her prowess on both sides of the ball also earned the respect of United Soccer Coaches who named her to their All-North Region team. Boade’s stellar season was highlighted by a brace in a come-from-behind victory against Nebraska and a one goal one assist performance against Purdue. Expectations If the Wildcats are to have any success this year Boade will be at the forefront. Her veteran leadership in the midfield will be especially important following the departure of Rowan Lapi. It will be up to Boade to head up that unit and facilitate chemistry between returners like Caterina Regazzoni and newcomers like grad transfer Jaelyn Eisenhart. Her NCAA tournament experience will allow her to push the team toward their ultimate goal because one taste of the postseason is never enough. It will be hard for Boade to improve upon 2022 but increasing her goal contributions could elevate her even further. She put shots on goal 58.6% of the time but converted less than half of those going 7-for-17. Dialing in her finishing would allow Boade to become more lethal for the Wildcats making an already potent offense even more dangerous. A strong fourth season would place Boade in the upper echelon of Wildcat footballers especially if she pushes Northwestern to a Big Ten Championship or a deep NCAA run.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Overview Returners: Jack Olsen (Sr.) Hunter Renner (Sr.) Will Halkyard (Sr.) Jacob Tabibian (Jr.) Luke Akers Newcomers: A.J. Henning (Jr. transfer Michigan) Don’t discount the importance of special teams especially for a roster that is going to need every advantage it can get. Three of the four slots here are filled by returning Wildcats with the exception being Michigan transfer A.J. Henning and the ceiling is high for the Illinois native returning to his home state. Olsen should be the first-string kicker heading into 2023. Injuries hampered his 2022 season and he has only one career attempted field goal in college but he’s primed to step into the starting role. The hope is that his leg will allow Northwestern to attempt longer tries this season after constantly shying away last year.  At punter Akers returns coming off a strong season but Renner was also effective (albeit in a smaller sample size). The two will continue to joust for the starting job but the winner should be a punter capable of dramatically impacting the field position battle. Halkyard will also return as the long snapper. Key player A.J. Henning ""Kicking and punting are arguably more important this year. The ‘Cats could really benefit from steady special teams play especially in a season when the roster seemingly lacks game-breaking playmakers to put points on the scoreboard... but it might have one."" Henning is super fast and undeniably effective in the return game. While it remains to be seen what kind of production he will provide as a wideout (his role will be more significant than it was in Ann Arbor) NU is getting a guy who is electric on kickoffs and punts.  Henning returned a punt 61 yards for a touchdown last year against UConn and said after the game that he knew he was going to score. He’s a confident player with all the tools in the world to produce at a high level. Northwestern is hoping he blossoms at receiver but is relying on him to be a game-breaker returning kicks. Big Question  What will Jack Olsen provide? We just haven’t seen much of Olsen so far because of his injury. Last year Northwestern did not attempt a kick from more than 40 yards out. It should this season. The ‘Cats need Olsen to be accurate and they need him to be able to make kicks from long range. Coach Braun and his staff will take any points they can get in 2023 as they try to scratch and claw their way to a few wins. ""If this offense is able to push into their opponents side of the field Olsen has to be able to convert for three should the drive stall. There’s likely to be a lot of drives that never get to that point so they have to put points on the board when they have a chance."" 2023 Special Teams Depth Chart Kicker: Jack Olsen Jacob Tabibian Punter: Luke Akers Hunter Renner Long Snapper: Will Halkyard Return Specialist: A.J.

Share this story As kickoff to the 2023 Northwestern football season is less than 20 days away Inside NU will have opponent previews for all 12 teams the Wildcats face off against this season. Starting off with NU’s opening opponent: Rutgers.  The Scarlet Knights found themselves in the bottom of the Big Ten once again finishing 1-8 in conference play and 4-8 overall. Since joining the Big Ten Rutgers has a 13- 66 record in conference play. With Greg Schiano at the helm the Scarlet Knights look to finally prove they belong in an ever-expanding conference full of perennial powerhouses of college football. Forced to play Michigan Penn State and Ohio State every season RU faces an arduous journey to be bowl contenders but has shown it is possible under Schiano in the past. The Scarlet Knights should be one of the more winnable game on the ‘Cats’ schedule but let’s take a deeper dive into the squad NU will see in under three weeks. The Basics Returning production: 73% (73% offense 72 % defense) 2022 record: 4-8 (1-8 B1G) Head Coach: Greg Schiano The Stats The following metrics are courtesy of Bill Connelly and ESPN. You can read more about the rankings and theory behind them here. 2023 SP+  Overall: 73rd 2023 SP+ Offense: 95th 2023 SP+  Defense:  50th 2022 Capsule The 2022 season started off hot for the Scarlet Knights winning their first three games of the year. Rutgers kicked off its season with a last-second upset winning 22-21 at Boston College to pick up its first victory of the season and followed it up with a 66-7 thrashing of Wagner College. The Scarlet Knights finished off their non-conference schedule with a 16-14 victory at Temple. Despite flying high after non-conference play RU came crashing back down to earth at the hands of the Iowa Hawkeyes. Despite having 300 passing yards and 20 first downs two Iowa defensive scores put the game out of reach for the Scarlet Knights. It did not get better for Rutgers as it was blown out 49-10 by the Ohio State Buckeyes. After losing by a point to Nebraska RU got back into the winning column with a homecoming victory against Indiana its only Big Ten win of the season. The home stretch of the season was abysmal for the Scarlet Knights with Rutgers being outscored 202-48 in its final five games of 2022. Rutgers’ offensive output which was the second-worst in the Big Ten (I think you can guess whose was worse) and in the bottom five in the nation forced Schiano to make a change. Rutgers parted ways with offensive coordinator Sean Gleeson who later joined Northwestern’s staff as an offensive analyst. Offensive Overview  It would be difficult to be worse on offense than Rutgers was in 2022 so expect to see improvement this year. Under new offensive coordinator Kirk Ciarrocca Rutgers will try to recreate its success under Ciarrocca from 2009-2010. Ciarrocca has bounced all over the Big Ten recently serving as the offensive coordinator for both Penn State and Minnesota. Both of those squads rely heavily on the run game to power their offense so expect the Scarlet Knights to establish the ground game early against the Wildcats.   RU turns to junior Gavin Wimsatt as its signal caller for the season. Wimsatt saw snaps in eight games and started in six. The Kentucky native threw for 757 yards and five touchdowns but had seven interceptions as well. He has shown the ability to use his legs as well breaking off a 48-yard run against BC. Wimsatt has not proven himself to be a serious threat to opposing defenses and will need to take a big leap forward if the Scarlet Knights want to be anything more than a bottom Big Ten team. Defensive Overview With how poorly its offense played there was a lot of pressure on Rutgers’ defense to keep it in games; however it was not great on that side of the ball either. The Scarlet Knights gave up 29.3 points per game the second-worst in the Big Ten. RU lacked a dominant pass rusher with no individual player recording four or more sacks. Furthermore Rutgers struggled to create turnovers. The Scarlet Knights only had 14 takeaways on the entire season putting them in the bottom 20% of college football. There is a lot of room for improvement on Joe Harasymiak’s defense in 2023. In the second year of his system look for the Scarlet Knights to play better defensively understand the system and communicate with everyone on the field. They already took positive steps forward in 2022 but now they will have to take a major leap to contend with Big Ten offenses. Three Players to Watch Edge Rusher Aaron Lewis Lewis was named Third-Team All-Big Ten last season and has been named to the Bednarik Award — given to the best defensive player in the nation — watchlist for the upcoming season. Standing at 6-foot-5 Lewis’ length gives him an advantage against blockers with his reach allowing him to create separation and make plays. The rising junior had multiple double-digit tackle games last season and also recorded eight tackles for loss.  While he has been good against the run the next step in Lewis’ game needs to be getting to the quarterback. For an edge rusher he only recorded 1.5 sacks in 2022. If he can put it all together he has a chance to be a premier edge rusher in the Big Ten. Wide Receiver Naseim Brantley Schiano dipped into the transfer portal and brought Brantley in after spending his college career at Western Illinois and Sacred Heart. During his lone year at Western Illinois Brantley had multiple 100-yard games and finished second in yards in the MVFC. At 6-foot-2 Brantley will provide a big target for Wimsatt this season but will have to prove he can compete at the Big Ten level. Running Back Kyle Monangai Monangai looks to join the lineage of successful running backs from Rutgers. Starting eleven games last year the rising junior ran for 445 yards on 105 carries including 162 yards against Michigan State. He has shown good burst but still needs to develop his game to become an every-down back. The rising junior only had six catches for 31 yards and found the end zone twice in 12 games last season.  He will need to demonstrate those skills if he wants to help the offense reach its potential this season.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you buy something from an SB Nation link Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Share this story When Pat Fitzgerald was suspended two weeks following Maggie Hickey’s investigation confirming that hazing occurred in the Northwestern football program most figured that the head coach would simply be away from the team’s facilities during a recruiting dead period and would return July 21. Little consideration was granted to the fact that David Braun was the Wildcats’ acting head coach to say the least. However only three days after news of Fitzgerald’s suspension the present reality for Northwestern changed exponentially with the 17-year head coach being fired for allegations of hazing racism and permitting a toxic culture. In one fell swoop Braun went from a first-time FBS coach to the head man at a Big Ten institution. Officially the former North Dakota State defensive coordinator was named the ‘Cats’ interim head coach on July 14 — under six months after he arrived in Evanston. The role of interim head coach in any sport presents a myriad of challenges and not just because of the actual word preceding someone’s title. Such coaches must recognize the limited timespan of their opportunities to lead while frequently being promoted with little prior notice. Further programs and teams often enter seasons ahead with the intentions to hire someone more experienced and tailored to long-term goals. Braun endures all of the challenges outlined above compounded with a team and school that has been the subject of continued negative reactions and headlines plus deep-seated questions about its culture practices and values. He’ll also become the first non-Fitzgerald head coach for Northwestern since Dec. 30 2005.  The circumstances are certainly not in Braun’s favor as is typical for any interim head coach. At the same time there have been definite success stories for temporary leaders turned full-fledged national championship-winning coaches. Below are five of the more noteworthy coaches who started with the interim tag and ultimately achieved tremendously at their schools. Dabo Swinney Clemson Swinney has grown into one of the more iconic and legendary coaches in college football primarily due to his achievements with the Tigers. He boasts an astonishing 161-39 record two national titles eight ACC crowns and 13 end-of-season AP Top 25 rankings. However Swinney was not entirely a high-profile assistant hand-picked by Clemson to be its next head coach before the start of a fresh slate. Following the resignation of Tommy Bowden on Oct. 13 2008 Swinney — then the team’s wide receivers coach — took over. Under Swinney’s guidance the Tigers went 4-2 in the regular season earning a spot in the Gator Bowl (but falling to Nebraska). Swinney was officially named Clemson’s full-time head coach on Dec. 1 2008. Since that promotion Clemson has remained a continual powerhouse producing 17 first-round NFL Draft picks and losing more than five games just once in Swinney’s 14-year tenure. Ed Orgeron LSU On Sept. 25 2016 LSU coach Les Miles was fired by the school following an 18-13 loss to Auburn which dropped the Tigers to 2-2. At that point Orgeron the team’s defensive line coach became the interim head coach. Over the remainder of that season LSU went 5-2 in the regular season with ranked victories over Ole Miss and Texas A&M. Orgeron had the interim tag removed on Nov. 26 prior to the team’s bowl game. The No. 19 Tigers closed the year with a dominating 29-9 Citrus Bowl win over No. 15 Louisville. In Baton Rouge Orgeron went 71-51 claiming the 2019 national title with one of the greatest teams in college football history. The Tigers won eight or more games four times from 2016 to 2021 when Orgeron was let go. Clay Helton USC Helton worked as the Trojans’ offensive coordinator in 2013 when he was named the team’s interim before its Las Vegas Bowl win over Fresno State. Two years later he became a more permanent interim when head coach Steve Sarkisian was fired for “erratic behavior” on Oct. 12 2015. In the final seven games of the 2015 regular season Helton led USC to a 5-2 mark including taking down No. 3 Utah. The school discarded the interim tag for Helton on Nov. 30 subsequent to a 40-21 win over rival No. 22 UCLA. Helton’s Trojans made the PAC-12 Championship but lost to No. 7 Stanford; the team also was defeated in the Holiday Bowl. Helton served as USC’s full-time head guide for six seasons thereafter accumulating a 40-20 mark a Rose Bowl trophy and conference championship and two consensus All-Americans. He’s now the coach at Georgia Southern which went 6-7 and lost the Camellia Bowl in Helton’s first year at the helm. Ryan Day Ohio State Day joined Ohio State in 2017 as the team’s co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. One year later he was elevated to full-time offensive coordinator. Yet in August 2018 Day was named OSU’s interim head coach as Urban Meyer was placed on administrative leave following an investigation about his knowledge of domestic abuse committed by assistant coach Zach Smith. Meyer was suspended for three games on Aug 22 2018 after the school’s investigation determined that Meyer and AD Gene Smith “failed to take sufficient management action relating to Zach Smith’s misconduct and retained an Assistant Coach who was not performing as an appropriate role model for OSU student-athletes.” In Meyer’s absence Day won the first three games of the 2018 campaign outscoring opponents — including No. 15 TCU — a ludicrous 169-62. Meyer returned in Week Four at which point the top-five Buckeyes started 7-0 and finished Big Ten and Rose Bowl champions. On Dec. 4 2018 Day was deemed Ohio State’s full-time leader after Meyer’s retirement. While he was not named head coach after an interrupted reign as interim per se Day still serves as an example of a part-time head coach garnering a job — in part due to his success as temporary leader. Since Day’s ultimate ascendance the Buckeyes have gone 42-6 making three of the last four College Football Playoffs winning two Big Ten titles and producing nine top-15 draft picks. Brent Key Georgia Tech Nine interim coaches led programs during the regular season in 2022 — including Key who became the Yellow Jackets’ interim on Sept. 26. Georgia Tech won its first two games with Key calling the shots including besting No. 24 Pitt on the road in his debut. The team finished 4-4 under its former offensive line coach with highlights including a road victory over No. 13 North Carolina. While only a .500 record the four conference wins were the most by Tech since 2018. Key was promoted to permanent head coach on Nov. 29 three days after the conclusion of the 2022 season. He’ll lead a Yellow Jackets team projected to finish 12th in the ACC and which loses quarterback Jeff Sims and second-round pick Keion White. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story The old adage says something along the lines of “Experience is the greatest teacher.” In the case of Northwestern soccer’s Ella Hase that utterance has rung true. The senior broke onto the scene in 2022 nabbing her first career goal and assist in 23 starts. Now she has plenty to set her sights on in her upcoming campaign. Who she is Senior; forward; 5-foot-5; from Orland Park Ill.; all-conference and all-state honoree in 2019 high school season Career Stats 79.6 minutes per game; four goals; seven assists; 15 points; 48.9% shots on goal. 2022 review Consider 2022 Ella Hase’s breakout campaign. Though she played major minutes in her freshman and sophomore seasons starting 13 games in each year her junior outing was her most prolific. Hase notched her first career goal against SIUE in the waning days of August. She proceeded to tally an assist and seven shots within the week at DePaul. Head coach Michael Moynihan observed the undeniable talent in the Illinois native and gave her the start in all 23 games of the season — as opposed to 2021 when he beckoned her off the bench four times. Among a flurry of big-time bin finders one of Hase’s most pivotal contributions in 2022 was an assist on the go-ahead goal against No. 20 Rutgers in the Big Ten Quarterfinal. After spending the year prior in flux between coming off the bench and starting on the pitch Hase solidified her role as a foundational part of the ‘Cats’ program in her junior season. She shined because of her ability to attack the box and employ her sharp game IQ which she used to make the smart pass time and time again. Expectations Going 23-for-23 in games started sets the bar pretty high. Setting career highs in goals assists shots and shots on goal set the bar even higher. Hase mowed down a gauntlet of objectives last year establishing her role as a game-in and game-out starter. Expect that to stay the same heading into 2023. Though the arrival of high school phenom Megan Norkett will crowd the forward room Hase has proven that she deserves a near-permanent spot on the field. In what could be her last season in Evanston Hase will doubtlessly continue to attack the goal. There’s a reasonable chance we see an increase in her shot total which sat at 35 at the end of 2022. Already savvy in the assist department it wouldn’t shock anybody to see the senior continue to spread the ball well on the attacking end of the pitch. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Eleven more days until Rutgers Week and 11 more teams for us to break down. We’ll keep on moving down Northwestern’s schedule with the first non-conference opponent on the docket: the UTEP Miners. The Basics Returning Production: 65% overall (67% percent of offense 63% of defense) (55/133 overall) 2022 Record: 5-7 (3-5 C-USA) Coach: Dana Dimel The Stats (via ESPN’s Bill Connelly) 2022 SP+ Overall: 98th 2022 SP+ Offense: 95th 2022 SP+ Defense: 92nd 2022 Capsule UTEP was coming off a seven-win season in 2021 which ended a seven-year bowl game drought that included a 2-34 stretch. With 71% of their production set to return the following year it seemed like there was a good chance the Miners could keep the fun going in 2022.  They came a win short of making that happen partially due to some inexplicable losses. After starting 0-2 with losses to North Texas and Oklahoma UTEP beat New Mexico State and headed to New Mexico for a chance to reach .500. Instead it lost by 17 points to a team that would go on to finish 2-10.  Quarterback Gavin Hardison and the offense caught fire in the next two games to take down Charlotte and a 10-win Boise State squad only to follow that up with a 41-31 loss to 3-9 Louisiana Tech. That bumpy rhythm only got rougher through the final couple weeks; the highs were nice but the lows plunged remarkably low. Hardison suffered a season-ending injury with three games to play and a loss to Middle Tennessee cast bowl game chances into doubt. Yet with just 38 minutes left in its regular season UTEP seemed to have steadied the rollercoaster. It had routed FIU for its fifth win a week earlier and led 24-0 on the road against a UTSA team that would go on to notch 11 wins. The Miners were on track for their first victory against their rivals in six seasons. Even better it would give them the chance to secure consecutive six-win seasons for the first time in almost two decades. UTSA didn’t even need the fourth quarter to make that all come crashing down. A 70-yard touchdown pass evened the score at 31 the ensuing UTEP drive ended in a red zone interception and the Roadrunners completed the comeback with a field goal as time expired.  It was one game but a microcosm of the season nonetheless. Dana Dimel’s team flashed signs that indicated it would sustain its 2021 success but couldn’t perform consistently enough to position itself in the upper half of Conference USA. With three All-C-USA Second Team players Hardison and his leading receiver in Tyrin Smith set to return the Miners still have a chance to make that happen in 2023. Offensive Overview Outside of Smith who racked up 1000 receiving yards UTEP’s offense wasn’t awesome last season. Hardison who will be a senior this year slightly regressed in almost every statistical category compared to 2021. The team finished second-to-last in the conference with 24.4 points per game and ranked near the bottom in offensive efficiency and touchdowns. While Hardison and Smith will return the offense could suffer due to the loss of All-Conference First Team right tackle Jeremiah Byers. He transferred to Florida State this offseason which could hurt the run game drastically. Further the Miners will lose Ronald Awatt — the leading rusher of their two-back committee — leaving Deion Hankins as the undisputed lead tailback. Even with limited carries Hankins was an All-C-USA Second Team honoree in 2022 so unleashing him as the bell cow could do wonders. Whether UTEP throws the ball a ton or continues to be multidimensional it will have to sustain consistency through the air. That’s not just from game-to-game but from play-to-play; Hardison completed just 52.1% of his throws. No quarterback in the entire FBS who tossed more than 300 passes last season had a lower completion percentage. Having his top pass catcher back — who transferred to Texas A&M and then back again in the same offseason — can’t hurt. Dimel will also have a new offensive coordinator in Scotty Ohara. The former receivers coach got promoted after Dave Warner retired following his two years with the staff.  Defensive Overview The Miners will lose a little more talent on the other side of the ball. Their two-leading sack-getters from last year Jadrian Taylor and Cal Wallerstedt had stellar senior seasons. Wallerstedt in particular had a remarkably impressive breakout with 95 tackles 14.5 tackles-for-loss and eight sacks after barely seeing the field in his first few seasons in El Paso. As for the positives fellow linebacker Tyrice Knight will be back. He’s already started nearly three full seasons for UTEP and has excelled both against the run and the pass. Knight is widely projected as an All-C-USA First Team lock and he was even selected to the Nagurski and Butkus Award Watch Lists earlier this month. Cornerback Ilijah Johnson and lineman Praise Amaewhule should also spearhead a Miner defense that surrendered the fewest yards per game in the conference. Kobe Hylton who totaled 10 TFLs and two forced fumbles as a corner should add even more depth to the secondary. If UTEP can end up on the right side of turnover luck — it only forced five interceptions in 12 games in 2022 — some more one-score wins (potentially including one in Evanston...) could be on the way. Three Players to Know WR Tyrin Smith As mentioned above Smith was an 1000-yard receiver in 2022 as well as the C-USA’s third leading pass-catcher in that category. Standing at 5-foot-7 the rising senior was  the slot machine who could bring home Texas-sized jackpots for the Miners on every play. He’s a constant deep threat and can also utilize his speed to turn bubble screens and short routes inside into big plays. Smith transferred to Texas A&M in January but then decided to return to UTEP in June after participating in spring practice with the Aggies. Newly-minted offensive coordinator Scotty Ohara should be thrilled to have the centerpiece of his receiving corps back as his primary weapon. The nation has taken notice of Smith too; he was named to the Biletnikoff Watch List earlier in the month.  Northwestern’s secondary is one of the team’s best position groups but it will be interesting to see how it will stop Smith. Wisconsin’s Chimere Dike — albeit six inches taller than Smith — had somewhat of a similar skillset inside the numbers and he ate the ‘Cats alive with big plays last October. Obviously David Braun can’t let that happen for NU to secure one of the most winnable games on its schedule. LB Tyrice Knight By most accounts Knight is UTEP’s best player. The accolades above don’t lie and neither do his numbers. Knight just missed out on his second straight 100-tackle season with 95 in 2022 put up five pass defenses and forced two fumbles. While his sack total may not have shown it the linebacker is a strong pass rusher on the outside. He could get some more opportunities to pressure quarterbacks since Wallerstedt and Taylor are both gone now. Knight should be a good test for Northwestern’s offensive line regardless of whether he lines up on the edge or at the second level. Given UTEP lost the bulk of its pass-rushing corps the Wildcats will be in a good position to win on Sept. 9 if they can take him out of the equation. OG Elijah Klein Playing next to arguably the best tackle in the conference means it’s almost impossible to stand out. That’s been the case for Klein who started at right guard next to the FSU-bound Byers. But now he’ll be the face of UTEP’s offensive line.  Klein has started the last 33 games for the Miners and he’s earned All-Conference USA Honorable Mentions in 2021 and 2022. The California native was a really great run-blocker last year especially as he helped UTEP record an average time of possession of 33:34 per game. That was good enough to rank 18th in the nation and UTEP’s 1.46 sacks allowed per contest came in at 21st in 2022. Klein is one of the most experienced linemen in the NCAA with 44 games already under his belt which isn’t great news for a Northwestern front that lost a ton of its pieces this offseason. According to the spring rosters he has at least 35 pounds on every NU defensive lineman besides P.J. Spencer Reginald Pearson Dylan Roberts and Carmine Bastone. It’s not too likely that any of those four guys will start out of the gate which makes it all the more important that Northwestern gets off to a quick start in Week Two to prevent Klein from dominating in the run game. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Home is where the heart is. It’s a saying we’ve all heard before. In the case of Northwestern forward Bridget Mitchell home is also where the team is. The senior from Lake Forest just north of Evanston saw lots of action in the NCAA tournament last season. This year she’ll try to make her presence felt throughout the season. Who she is Senior; forward; 5-foot-5; from Lake Forest Ill.; went undefeated in club play in 2019 with the #4 team in the country Career Stats 13.7 minutes per game; six games; 1 goal; 2 points; 1 shot on goal; 100% shots on goal. 2022 Review Despite a prolific high school career and time on the Olympic Development Regional Team as a middle schooler Mitchell rarely saw action during her first two years at Northwestern. Prior to her junior year she appeared in just one game making a nine-minute cameo in a 2-0 loss to North Carolina in 2021. 2022 appeared to be heading in the same direction. as Mitchell only saw nine minutes of regular season action appearing on September 29 in a draw with Rutgers. However her key contributions would come under the bright lights of the post season. Her appearance against Penn State in the Big Ten semifinal saw a career-high at the time 15 minutes but the ‘Cats came up short falling 2-0 to the Nittany Lions. At the NCAA tournament Mitchell’s contributions proved indispensable. After just three minutes in a blowout of SIUE she would get seven minutes against Vanderbilt. Even with limited minutes she made the most of her time on the pitch redirecting a saved Josie Aulicino shot in the 81st minute to provide the ‘Cats’ go-ahead goal in a 2-1 victory. It was her first shot in her colligate career and sent Northwestern to the Sweet 16 for just the third time in program history.  Expectations While the 2022 season would end against UCLA in the Sweet 16 Mitchell played well off the bench in a career-high 39 minutes. Big minutes off the bench appear like the best-case scenario for her this season as well given that the forward room already has players like Ella Hase Ingrid Falls Aurea del Carmen and freshman phenom Megan Norkett.  However there’s no shame in contributions off the bench as Mitchell proved against Vanderbilt last year. She showed that she’s unafraid in the big moments and willing to take a big shot if the opportunity presents itself. Assuming her playing time improves on last year it’s unlikely she’ll keep her mark of 100% shooting but she will have a lot more chances to put a ball in the back of the net this year.    \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Last year Northwestern spent almost the entire first half of the season in a goalkeeper by committee approach. In the second half of games second team All-Big Ten goalie Mia Raben would protect the net. The first halves however were for freshman Reiley Fitzpatrick. Raben as a graduate transfer is gone now but Fitzpatrick is still here hoping to keep the goalkeeper job all to herself. Who she is Sophomore; goalkeeper; 5-foot-10; from Ashburn Va.; Virginia Class 5 Female Athlete of the Year in high school Career Stats 44.8 minutes per game; 11 starts; 493 total minutes; 4 goals allowed; 5 saves; 55.6% save percentage; 28 shots faced; 6-0-1 record. 2022 Review Fitzpatrick committed to Northwestern back in November of 2021 eight months before Raben joined the team as a graduate transfer. Despite Raben’s arrival it was Fitzpatrick who got the start when the Wildcats opened their season against Kansas State. She did give up a goal against the other purple Wildcats but then did not allow a goal over her next three games. That stretch included the first save of her career against Kansas and the first credited win of her career against SIUE. As the calendar turned to September Fitzpatrick continued to improve. She made another save in the win of Xavier then another against Butler a week later. From September 4 through September 18 over a four-game span Fitzpatrick did not allow a single goal. She made two saves (against Xavier and Butler) and compiled a 4-0 record. Unfortunately for Fitzpatrick that was the high point of her season and some of her last action. While she earned another win against Purdue she gave up a pair of goals against Nebraska and watched from the sideline as Raben made eight second-half saves. In what would prove to be Fitzpatrick’s last appearance of the year she had the best performance of her career making two saves in the September 25 win over Minnesota.  Expectations As mentioned in the opening paragraph Raben was in her last year of eligibility. She and Fitzpatrick formed a formidable one-two punch at goalkeeper combining to hold Northwestern’s opponents scoreless for nearly 450 minutes the sixth-longest streak in program history. With Raben gone Fitzpatrick who was never credited with a loss last year should be the favorite to win the job. However there will likely be some complications. Gina Muzi a graduate transfer from St. John’s who compiled 42 saves and a 7-5-5 record is here this year. So is CJ Roy a freshman from the Washington DC area. Fitzpatrick has the most Northwestern experience of the trio but that might not be the deciding factor in who the starter is at the end of the season. If that starter is Fitzpatrick then the ideal season for her would probably involve a similar performance but in 90-minute increments instead of 45. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Danika Austin was a four-year starter for the Wildcats. In 2023 she’ll add a fifth year to that tally. The Third Team All-Big Ten defender is returning to the team to build on the success that Northwestern found last season. We preview her one last ride in purple and white. Who is she? Graduate student; defender; from Jenison Michigan; 2022 Third Team All-Big Ten; has played in and started all but one game in her college career Career Stats 87.2 minutes per game; 70 games played; 70 starts; 6102 minutes; two goals; eight assists; 12 points 2022 Review Alongside Emma Phillips Austin was the cornerstone of a Wildcat defense that only allowed 18 goals over 23 games. Her leadership on the backline kept opposing offenses in check but Austin herself contributed to some Wildcat scoring. She tied her career high in points (five) adding one goal and three assists to the Northwestern offense.  Austin was also disciplined earning only one yellow card. This clean play allowed her to play the full 90 in 21 of the ‘Cats 23 games providing stability to one of the most vital units on the pitch. Her 2054 minutes played were the most on the team and she was the only Wildcat to register over 2000 minutes. Expectations Austin has been a consistent and steadfast presence in the Wildcat defense for the past four years and her return for a fifth year greatly increases Northwestern’s chances at success. She’ll slot in on the backline next to Emma Phillips and Nicole Doucette and their experience should help cover the loss of Rowan Lapi. Austin’s four-year pedigree will also give confidence to the goalkeeper whether it be transfer Gina Muzi or returning sophomore Reiley Fitzpatrick. No. 29 will need to be a vocal leader on the pitch in order to mesh the familiar faces with the new crop of ‘Cats. Austin will serve as a role model for the newcomers as to what it means to be a Northwestern Women’s Soccer player and she will need to supplement that leadership with consistent play as she has done for the past four seasons. Her biggest responsibility will be forging the connection between the defense and the midfield turning both into one coherent unit that allows opposing offenses zero space to create. With Austin back at the helm coach Michael Moynihan’s defense remains in good hands. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Navigating one’s freshman year of college tends to be pretty difficult. Unless of course your name is Caterina Reggazoni. Reggazoni tore through her freshman season easily winning Big Ten Freshman of the Year and earning a spot on the All-Big Ten Third Team. And oh yeah she also helped Northwestern tie or break eight program records last season. Now it’s time for an encore. Who she is Sophomore; midfielder; 5-foot-10; from Zurich Switzerland; 2022 Third Team All-Big Ten; 2022 Big Ten Freshman of the Year; U20 Fifa Youth Cup Champion; Swiss Cup Champion Career Stats 87.7 minutes per game (22 games); 3 goals; 3 assists; 9 points; 51.3% shots on goal. 2022 Review As stated earlier it is not easy to get your feet under you as a college freshman. Reggazoni however made it look easy taking defenders to school over a month before classes started for the fall quarter. It took her just 64 minutes of collegiate play to score her first career goal against Kansas State which helped spark Northwestern to a 2-1 victory. Reggazoni also played every single minute in 20 of the team’s 22 games last season including each of the last 19. After Kansas State she was held scoreless for over a month until the Nebraska contest on September 22. In that game arguably the best of her career she scored a goal in the eighth minute and added a pair of assists.  The rest of the season was a little quieter for Reggazoni. She added another goal against Michigan and an assist in the NCAA tournament opener against SIUE but those were the only other times she showed up on the scoreboard. However she still finished fifth on the team in points and tied for fifth in assists proving her value to the offense. She was named Big Ten Freshman of the Year for her performance on the pitch. Expectations Needless to say it’s unlikely that either Reggazoni or Northwestern will sneak up on anyone this year. On August 9 Northwestern was ranked 18th in the United Soccer Coaches Preseason Poll the highest preseason rank in school history. On Tuesday the Big Ten released its own soccer preseason poll which had Northwestern second in the conference. Reggazoni is a key factor behind the hype and is also receiving a fair bit of praise herself. She was named a player to watch by the conference one of three Wildcats to receive the honor. Her inaugural season saw her become one of the best players on the team — without having to put the word “freshman” as a qualifier. This year she figures to be just as important if not more so to the team’s hopes. The rising sophomore finished third on the team in shots last year behind only fellow returnees Josie Aucilino and Aurea del Carmen. A big reason for that was her consistency on the field with the Iowa game on October 20 standing as the lone game in which she didn’t participate. Regazzoni was a near-constant presence for the team last year and no matter what happens to her scoring or assist totals she’ll most likely be on the field almost every minute this year. All ‘Cats fans have to do is hope that the sequel to her first year is even better than the original. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Just 10 days to go until Rutgers week which means 10 more teams for us to break down. Next up on the list is Minnesota which will be Northwestern’s first home Big Ten opponent this year. The Basics Returning Production:  58% (59% offense 59% defense) 2022 Record: 9-4 (5-4 B1G Pinstripe Bowl Champions) Coach: P.J. Fleck The Stats (via ESPN’s Bill Connelly) 2023 Preseason SP+ Overall: 104th 2023 Preseason SP+ Offense: 95th 2023 Preseason SP+ Defense: 96th 2022 Capsule After a 9-4 2021 that ended with a three-game winning streak and a victory in the Guaranteed Rate Bowl P.J. Fleck and Minnesota looked to continue building on that momentum in 2022.  At the start of the season it certainly looked like that would be the case. The Golden Gophers ran through September like a hot knife through butter going 4-0 with a total scoreline of 183-24. That stretch culminated in a 34-7 domination of Michigan State who had gone 11-2 the year before and saw Minnesota reach a ranking of No. 21 in the AP Poll. However that would be the high point of the season for Minnesota. In a 20-10 loss to Purdue on Oct. 1 sixth-year quarterback Tanner Morgan threw a trio of interceptions and no touchdowns. Two weeks later against Illinois Morgan was injured on a fourth quarter run forcing untested freshman Athan Kaliakmanis into action. Kaliakmanis went 2-for-6 to close out the loss then went 9-for-22 in a 28-point blowout at the hands of Penn State. Morgan returned for a shutout victory over Rutgers snapping a three-game losing streak. However he was relieved by Kaliakmanis after being injured again in the first half against Nebraska a game that the Golden Gophers would come back to win. With Kaliakmanis at the reins Minnesota flattened Northwestern 31-3 then took a tough last-second loss to Iowa. Kaliakmanis bounced back nicely in the season finale against Wisconsin completing 19-for-29 passes with a pair of touchdowns setting career highs in all three marks. Against Syracuse in their bowl game Kaliakmanis got the start and played most of the first half then got injured himself. That gave way to Morgan who threw a pair of touchdowns in the victory. At the close of the season it became obvious that Minnesota’s place in the college football hierarchy was right about where it should be. While the Golden Gophers were receiving 50 or more votes in both the AP and Coaches Polls their offensive inconsistency doomed them to a spot in the “receiving votes” only club. Running back Mohamed Ibrahim and center John Michael Schmitz both made the All-Big Ten First Team but the chaotic revolving door at quarterback probably capped the team’s ceiling to be just outside of the top 25. Offensive Overview Speaking of Ibrahim and Schmitz both of them are now gone with Schmitz taken in the second round of the NFL Draft by the New York Giants and Ibrahim joining the Detroit Lions as an undrafted free agent. Morgan the program record-holder for passing yards touchdowns and completion percentage in a season as well as games won by a quarterback is also gone. However the offense which put up over 28 points per game last year should be able to keep its production level at or near last year’s. The reason for that is the experience level catching the ball. Chris Autman-Bell who made All-Big Ten honorable mention at receiver in 2021 missed most of last season with an injury but is back for one last ride. Brevyn Spann-Ford who led the team in receptions from his tight end spot is also back for his final season. Daniel Jackson who led the team in receiving yards and touchdowns last year despite missing two games will also be a player to watch. However the key to this year will be whoever is standing in the backfield. Kaliakmanis who finished last season with a 54% completion percentage and three touchdowns against four interceptions will probably need a dependable run game as the year begins to get his feet under him. Sean Tyler a graduate transfer from Western Michigan who rushed for over 1000 yards last year will help with that. Trey Potts who rushed for 471 yards last season in a backup role will also see a decent amount of action. Defensive Overview  The defense also lost a lot of production even if the producers were slightly lesser-known than their offensive counterparts. Mariano Sori-Marin who led the team in tackles last year is gone as is Jordan Howden who finished third on the team in tackles while adding a pair of interceptions and five pass breakups. Terell Smith put up those same numbers in pass coverage while also adding 4.5 tackles for loss further depleting secondary depth. Despite those departures it’s not all doom and gloom for the Golden Gophers. Danny Striggow the team’s sack leader last year is back to help shore up a defensive line that kept most of its key contributors. Cody Lindenberg who was Honorable Mention All-Big Ten last year also returned a major blessing for a linebacker group trying to replace Sori-Marin’s production.  ""The key to the defense though will be Tyler Nubin. The fifth-year senior made second team All-Big Ten last season after tallying 55 tackles four interceptions and three pass breakups and he’s back for more this year. Hes one of just six players in the Minnesota secondary with more than three years of collegiate experience and the only one to do so without either redshirting or transferring in. Alongside Justin Walley Nubin is the only returning starter in the defensive backfield and he will be the leader of the defense this year."" Three Players to Know WR Chris Autman-Bell Autman-Bell is probably the best receiving talent the Golden Gophers have and arguably has been for the past three seasons. He finished second on the team in receiving yards in 2020 then led the team in 2021 with 506. He was on pace to do so yet again last season but suffered a season-ending injury in the Colorado victory. Autman-Bell made his mark in all three games he played in garnering at least three catches in each. He was especially dangerous in the Western Illinois victory grabbing five passes for a season-high 118 yards. Against Colorado he hauled in his only touchdown of the year from 39 yards out. He’s proven his worth as a deep threat ever since 2020 when he took four receptions against Maryland for 112 total yards. ""With Ibrahim gone (and assuming health) Autman-Bell is the biggest playmaking threat on this Minnesota roster. Hes already ninth all-time on Minnesota leaderboards with 1970 career receiving yards and will almost certainly crack the top 10 in receptions and receiving touchdowns this year. He’s also made a catch in an astounding 41 straight games. In short defensive backs like Coco Azema and Rod Heard II will have their hands full with Autman-Bell all game long."" OT Quinn Carroll After three seasons at Notre Dame that included 12 games in 2021 the Edina Minnesota native returned back home for his final few years of college football. Standing at 6-foot-7 and 315 pounds Carroll started all 13 games at right tackle last year for the Golden Gophers. His play was instrumental for a Minnesota offense that finished 16th in the nation in rushing yards last season.  Carroll was also a major factor in the passing game. Despite all the chaos and injuries in the quarterback room the pocket remained clean all year long. Minnesota allowed just 1.15 sacks per game last year 18th in the nation and second in the Big Ten behind only Ohio State. The team also gave up just 57 tackles for loss last year good for a tie for 20th nationwide. With John Michael Schmitz no longer snapping the ball it’s unlikely Minnesota’s offensive line will be as good as last year’s at least right away. However it’s quite possible Carroll could lead a devastating rushing attack against the Wildcats. Not a single Northwestern defensive lineman weighs more than him and only one (Carmine Bastone) comes within 15 pounds. If Northwestern defenders see No. 77 coming at them on September 23 they better be ready. DB Tyler Nubin The versatile defensive back is arguably the Golden Gophers’ best defensive player and if not he’s at least their best turnover guy. Nubin picked off four passes last year to lead the team and he also forced a fumble. When he’s not forcing turnovers he’s making life miserable for offenses in other ways as his 55 tackles and three pass breakups can attest to that. Minnesota’s secondary picked off 15 passes last year a mark that tied for 14th in the country. They also gave up just eight passing touchdowns all year which means that yes quarterbacks playing against Minnesota last season nearly put up two interceptions for every touchdown they threw. Nubin was a major factor in establishing that no fly zone and the end result was a defense that was seventh nationally in passing efficiency allowed. Against Northwestern Nubin was all over the field. He finished in a tie for second on the team with five tackles helping hold the Wildcats to 3-of-12 on third down. He also picked off Ryan Hilinski’s last pass of the day helping set up a field goal early in the third quarter. Whether it’s Hilinski or someone else like Ben Bryant throwing the ball this year they’ll have to make sure they know where Nubin is — and that he isn’t where they’re throwing it.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story As we inch closer to the start of the 2023 Northwestern football season we continue to break down the faces the Wildcats will see across the field for their campaign. Today we look at NU’s toughest non-conference opponent and arguably a top 25 team in the nation: the Duke Blue Devils. The Basics Returning Production: 71% overall (82% of offense 60% of defense) (32/133 overall) 2022 Record:  9-4 (5-3 ACC) Head Coach: Mike Elko (2nd Season) The Stats The following metrics are courtesy of Bill Connelly and ESPN. You can read more about the rankings and theory behind them here. 2023 SP+ Overall: 50th 2023 SP+ Offense: 45th 2023 SP+ Defense: 54th 2022 Capsule Mike Elko’s first season in Durham could not have gone any better for the Blue Devils. In the first game of Elko’s tenure Duke put up 500 yards of offense and blanked Temple 30-0. The following week Duke headed north to Evanston to take on the Wildcats. The Blue Devils took a commanding 21-0 lead in the first quarter but NU refused to go quietly. Evan Hull’s fumble at the half-yard line with seconds left in the game sealed the victory for Duke lifting them over the ‘Cats for the second year in a row. The Blue Devils cruised to another non-conference victory over North Carolina A&T which set up a battle of undefeateds against 3-0 Kansas. Both sides traded punches throughout the game but the Jayhawks prevailed 35-27 handing Duke its first loss of the season. The following week the Blue Devils earned their first conference victory over Virginia but struggled early in ACC play.  Duke attempted to make a comeback against Georgia Tech scoring with eight seconds left in regulation to force overtime but a Yellow Jacket field goal proved to be the difference maker as the Blue Devils fell short 23-20. The following week Duke was on the receiving end of a last-second score that changed the outcome of the game. With the Blue Devils leading by four North Carolina quarterback Drake Maye found Antoine Green in the endzone with just 16 seconds left sending the Tar Heels home with a 38-35 win over their long-time rival. After back-to-back heartbreaking losses the Blue Devils bounced back with a 45-21 trouncing against Miami and staved off a Boston College comeback to hold on to a 38-31 win. Returning to Durham Duke picked up a 24-7 victory over Virginia Tech putting itself  in contention for the ACC Championship game. However the Blue Devils fell behind to Pitt and a failed two-point conversion with 47 seconds left in the fourth quarter left Duke just short of a comeback. Elko and Co. had lost another one-possession game 28-26. In the final regular season game the Blue Devils once again found themselves locked in a tight contest with Wake Forest. Trailing for most of the final frame Duke finally found itself  on the positive side of a fourth-quarter comeback taking the lead with just over two minutes to play. The defense held on for a 34-31 victory and Duke went bowling for the first time since 2018. In the Military Bowl the Blue Devils took on UCF and dominated as the game went on. They forced two turnovers scored twice in the last two minutes before halftime and cruised to a 30-13 bowl win to close out Elko’s inaugural campaign in Durham. Offensive Overview Returning 82% of its production Duke’s offense will be one of the premier attacking units in the nation. Riley Leonard will once again be under center for the Blue Devils looking to build off a strong 2022 season. Leonard completed 64% of passes last season averaged 228.2 yards per game and tossed 20 touchdowns. The rising junior only threw six interceptions putting him in the top 25 of all quarterbacks in college football. Leonard also added nearly 700 yards and 13 TDs on the ground showing his ability to be a true dual-threat quarterback. To put it frankly Leonard is going to be one of the best quarterbacks in college football this year. He sees the field very well but is also extremely elusive and hard to bring down. As well as bringing its QB back Duke returns both of its top targets from a year ago. Both Jalon Calhoun and Jordan Moore are back in Durham and look to improve from the already impressive numbers in 2022. The duo combined for 122 catches 1529 yards and nine touchdowns Both have tremendous speed and can run the route tree extremely well. All in all the Blue Devils’ receiving corps is a nightmare for opposing secondaries and defensive coaches. Duke also brings back its three-headed monster of a backfield from last season: Jordan Waters Jaylen Coleman and Jaquez Moore. The group combined for 304 touches 1585 yards and 17 touchdowns. It did not matter who had the ball: the Blue Devils were going to move the pile and run the opponents into the ground. With all of its major pieces back Duke’s offense should not miss a beat from where it left off last season. This offense can attack from all areas on the field keeping defenses on their heels for all 60 minutes. If you are a betting person take the Blue Devils over in every game because they can flat-out score. Defensive Overview Although they were led by a defensive-minded head coach the Blue Devils found themselves in multiple shootouts last season. Duke found itself just inside the bottom half of teams in yards allowed but finished inside the top 35 in points allowed in the 2022 season. The Blue Devils got after quarterbacks well last season racking up 36 sacks 29 QB hits and 167 pressures. Duke also had 70 tackles for losses so the Blue Devils were constantly sending opponents backward. The Blue Devils love to get the entire defense involved in the pass rush evidenced by defensive back Brandon Johnson being tied for the most sacks on the team with 5.5.  Duke’s defense also did a phenomenal job of taking away the football. The Blue Devils fell on 16 out of 24 fumbles last season and added 10 interceptions as well putting their total turnovers gained in the nation’s top 10 in the nation. Duke had contributions from top to bottom in creating turnovers with multiple players having takeaways in their stat sheet.  There is still room for improvement for the Blue Devils’ defense but they have the tools to play complimentary football to a dominant offense. If Duke can hold teams to fewer than four scores its offense can carry them over the finish line. Three Players to Watch QB Riley Leonard Leonard is one of the country’s premier dual-threat quarterbacks heading into the 2023 season. He is one of two quarterbacks to have 20+ passing touchdowns and 13+ rushing touchdowns last season joining Oregon’s Bo Nix. For a quarterback No. 13 loves to lower the boom as a runner. He understands the zone scheme but once he gets around the edge and into the open field there is no catching him. However unlike most mobile quarterbacks Leonard has a great pocket presence; he knows when to step up in the pocket and let it rip. He has great touch on the ball and fits throws into tight windows constantly. His footwork is clean and the zip off the ball is phenomenal. The more of his tape I watch the more impressed I am. Leonard is one of my sneaky Heisman candidates for 2023 because he has all the traits to light college football on fire this season. With his entire cast of weapons back and another year of chemistry under their belts Leonard will take a big step forward from an already tremendous 2022 campaign. DL DeWayne Carter  The senior captain for the Blue Devils is a force to be reckoned with in the trenches. Carter was named preseason First-Team All-ACC by a multitude of publications and was named to the Lott IMPACT Trophy Watch List. In his career he has recorded 85 tackles with a quarter going for negative yards and 11 sacks. In 2022 alone he had 11 TFLs and 5.5 sacks leading Duke in both categories. He has forced seven fumbles during his tenure in Durham and recovered three of them. Carter received an 86.3 PFF defensive grade last season. He is an offensive lineman’s nightmare. At 6-foot-3 and 305 pounds he can bully interior linemen with a pure bullrush using his length to create separation and get to the quarterback. Expect No. 90 in blue to see double-teams on most snaps because that is the only way to slow him down. OL Graham Barton When you have such a high-powered offense protection up front is key to being successful. Luckily for Duke it has an absolute star in Barton protecting Leonard’s blind side. He played nearly every snap last season and did not flinch. According to PFF in 896 plays last year Barton only allowed two sacks and eight hurries. His play earned him First-Team All-ACC honors for 2022. It will be tough sledding for pass rushers all season and Leonard will have plenty of time to go through his reads and find the open receiver down the field. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Capping off our player previews of the 2023 Wildcats who are set to begin their season tonight against Marquette at 7 p.m. CT we preview Northwestern’s star junior. Josie Aulicino has been an offensive engine for the ‘Cats from the moment she arrived in Evanston and that shouldn’t change in 2023. Who is she? Senior; midfielder; from Northville Michigan; 2022 Third Team All-Big Ten and United Soccer Coaches Third Team All-North Region; has made an All-Big Ten team all three of her years at NU Career Stats 53 games played 53 starts; 4601 minutes; 16 goals; 21 assists; 53 points 2022 Review Aulicino entered 2022 looking to build off a wildly impressive sophomore season in which she tallied six goals and eight assists. She was successful in that endeavor affirming her status as one of the best midfielders in the Big Ten. Her nine goals and 10 assists placed her within the top five of the Big Ten in shots on goal (first) points (second) assists (third) and goals (T-5th). She also topped the Wildcats in goals assists and points (28) and her 10 assists are second most in program history. In her 23 starts Aulicino terrorized opposing defenses with her well-rounded abilities keeping her as a constant threat. Northwestern never felt out of a game as long as Aulicino was on the field which was a total of 1985 minutes. She had four games with at least one goal and one assist with her high in points coming against SIUE when she notched two goals and an assist. Her production earned her Third Team All-Big Ten and All-North honors both of which seem low to anyone who watched Aulicino in person. Expectations In 2023 Aulicino will look to lead the team in goals and assists for the third straight season on their road to redemption. Expectations are high for the Wildcats and meeting them will rely heavily on Aulicino. She is the most prominent face of the three-headed offensive monster that is herself Aurea del Carmen and Meg Boade and the connection between those three will be critical to Northwestern’s success.  It may seem odd to say considering her 18 assists over the past two years but Aulicino will need to remember that other players on the team can facilitate score and distribute. Recognizing this will make her life easier as she is not the only one who has to get it done and it will also make her more dangerous as there will be too many threats for the opposing defense to keep track of. Aulicino is a near-perfect attacking midfielder and her senior year will allow her to keep showing that to the nation. If Aulicino continues to improve year-over-year Northwestern can end the season with the Big Ten trophy in hand and No. 8 figures to slot in to a spot on the All-Big Ten First Team.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Aurea del Carmen is back and she will lead one of the most experienced front lines in the nation. The All-Big Ten Second Teamer should make a huge impact as a passer and a scorer for Northwestern just as she did last year: Who is she? Graduate student; forward; from Gilroy Calif.; 2022 Second Team All-Big Ten; honored with United Soccer Coaches’ Third Team All-North Region selection last season. Career Stats 43.2 minutes per match (averaged 69.6 in 2022); 70 matches played; 51 starts; 3022 minutes; 12 goals; seven assists; 31 points 2022 Review Aurea del Carmen got off to a great start in 2021 but she typically came on as a sub to start the season. One of those things changed in 2022 and one of them stayed the same. The forward started every one of Northwestern’s 23 matches and put up 12 points before September even ended. Del Carmen made an instant impact both as a passer and a scorer going on a stretch where she recorded a point in seven of 10 contests. She was particularly great in a crucial Big Ten clash on Sept. 29 against No. 10 Rutgers which ended in a 1-1 draw. Not only did del Carmen score Northwestern’s lone goal eight minutes in on a nice header she also served as a constant offensive threat throughout the remainder of the match. She put up four of NU’s six shots on goal that night which marked her career high. From there del Carmen continued to enjoy a breakout season netting a go-ahead second-half goal against Wisconsin and taking on huge minutes as Northwestern approached the NCAA Tournament. Even though she went point-less in her last five matches del Carmen’s presence freed up her teammates; it’s why Michael Moynihan played her for the full 90 against Vanderbilt and UCLA in November.  All in all it was a tremendous season for No. 7. Her 17 points were second on the team behind Josie Aulicino and 10 of those came in Big Ten play. Aulicino was also the only player on the team to put up more shots on goal which is pretty impressive considering many of NU’s starters near the front played around 200 more minutes than del Carmen did.  Expectations With the bulk of Northwestern’s core back this fall del Carmen should see even more opportunities to make game-changing plays both as a facilitator and finisher. The support of Aulicino Meg Boade and Ella Hase in the attacking half guarantees that defenders can’t key in on swarming one player which could open up the field for everybody. This is a group with the experience and talent necessary for a Big Ten title campaign and del Carmen should be at the forefront of that effort as a returning grad student. Even if she doesn’t go on a ridiculous scoring run as she did last September the forward will give NU a huge advantage if she can continue working her way inside the box early in matches to pressure defenders and goalkeepers. If del Carmen can do that as Northwestern takes on the Big Ten and postseason gauntlets then the opportunities will come seamlessly. They may not necessarily show in her statline but the ‘Cats have more than enough weapons to capitalize. Her offensive versatility will be crucial for Northwestern to thrive against the Big Ten’s elite and advance in November again.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story On Wednesday Northwestern fans and media members had the opportunity to hear from head coach David Braun for just the second time since the onset of the Wildcats’ fall camp and the fourth time as head coach. While the team’s practice was initially slated to be open to the media it was closed without explanation. After Braun spoke to reporters transfers QB Ben Bryant WR A.J. Henning and DL Richie Hagarty also talked for the first time after changing to purple and white. Here are four of the major points made by all four in the penultimate media availability of camp. Saturday’s Scrimmage Will be Significant Following his opening statement Braun’s first question was immediately about the team’s starting quarterback. When asked if Bryant would be NU’s QB1 — as many presume — he indicated that the team is still in “open competition” only 17 days away from its opener at Rutgers. Moreover Braun shared that he would make a decision about the Wildcats’ starter subsequent to a scrimmage held on Saturday (which will not be open to the media). It is unclear whether or not that news will be promptly disseminated on social media by parties involved or if we’ll find out at next Wednesday’s media sessions. To little surprise Braun placed Bryant and junior Brendan Sullivan in a similar echelon saying that both are “doing a great job of competing.” For specific praises of each Braun stressed Sullivan’s athleticism and mobility while talking about Bryant’s timing with passes. In terms of ascertaining the team’s starter Braun underscored that the decision will be his but that he will “lean heavily” on offensive coordinator Mike Bajakian. Likewise as he was at Big Ten Media Days on July 26 Braun was emphatic about the role of a premier quarterback with that player needing to inspire the entire sideline and find “a way to rally a football team.” Beyond just gunslinger several other positional hierarchies will likely start to become resolved after the team’s scrimmage. Other spots to watch include along the offensive and defensive lines — more on them in a bit — plus safety and punter. Offensive Defensive Lines Work in Progress Northwestern’s trench units on both sides of the ball were dismal last year and they have only lost considerable faces and talent this offseason. Along the offensive line the ‘Cats will no longer field three veteran starters in LT Peter Skoronski OC Charlie Schmidt and RT/RG Ethan Wiederkehr not to mention transfer guard Vince Picozzi who combined to account for 3267 snaps in 2022. The only returning starters for NU are Josh Priebe who suffered a second straight season-ending leg injury and junior Caleb Tiernan. In light of uncertainty regarding who Northwestern will utilize to protect its quarterback and generate push in its run game Braun alluded to the fact that the unit is not yet where he would like but that he’s expecting gelling to occur throughout the season. In particular Braun praised the depth and “trajectory” of the room. Subsequent to losing 82.2% of its offensive line snaps from last year questions loom about position changes for players like Priebe or interior linemen such as Jackson Carsello Dom D’Antonio and Ben Wrather. Braun suggested that offensive line coach Kurt Anderson has been mixing and matching to generate the best possible lineup. A similar theme can be determined from the Wildcats’ defensive line which suffers the departure of anchor Adetomiwa Adebawore plus veterans Devin O’Rourke and Ryan Johnson. In the spring Braun didn’t hide the fact that the group needed to be bolstered and it was by bringing in transfers Hagarty (Southern Illinois) Matt Lawson (Fresno State) and R.J. Pearson (Bethune-Cookman). Roughly five months later Braun said that the team’s DL group “is not where they need to be at today.” However as with offensive line the head coach was optimistic about depth and development — both over the course of the campaign and even fall camp suggesting that the defensive line “can help us win a football game” in Piscataway New Jersey. Top Transfers Articulate Positive Experiences at NU After venturing to Evanston this spring Bryant (Cincinnati) Henning (Michigan) and Hagarty (Southern Illinois) spoke glowingly about their time at Northwestern thus far. When discussing the ongoing quarterback battle the sixth-year Bryant said that his peers have “welcomed him with open arms” and deemed the room one of the smartest he’s seen. “Since we’ve gotten here it’s been nothing but positive” Bryant said. Regarding whether the transfers have discussed hazing allegations with more long-standing players or coaches Bryant suggested those conversations have not occurred offering “All we know is what we know.” After playing at Miami (Ohio) and Southern Illinois it was easy to glean just how excited Hagarty was to be playing at NU. The 2022 First Team All-MVFC selection emphasized that “everybody can play” at the Big Ten level including third- and fourth-string players and called it a “positive change-up.” As for his role on the team’s defense Hagarty suggested that he’s “integrating as a leader role” due to his experience. Henning won two Big Ten titles and made consecutive College Football Playoff appearances with the Wolverines and is hoping to extrapolate his big-game experience with his new Wildcat teammates. “Bringing that level of intensity in the meeting room; doing the little things right” said Henning about what’s needed to appear in marquee contests adding “I know what it takes to get there.” Fans have wondered how Henning — with only 25 career receptions and 15 total rushes — best projects in the Wildcats’ offense. The Illinois native was very receptive to whatever role Bajakian envisions for him including in the slot on the perimeter or in the backfield. “Anything I’m up for it” Henning said. “I feel like I can affect the game in multiple ways.” It’s possible that Northwestern’s starting quarterback and top two receivers will all be transfers. Despite all arriving from different destinations Bryant noted how he’s been able to build a rapport with pass-catchers. “It’s gotten better and better throughout camp” the quarterback said focusing specifically on constructive conversations after reps and connecting throughout the summer. Wildcats Viewing 2023 Season No Differently Despite Scandals Northwestern was victorious in just one game a season ago its worst win total since 1989. The team has not prevailed on a game in American soil since October 2021 — ironically against Rutgers the opponent against which it will begin a new era. Compounding existing woes are the allegations of severe and coercive hazing that not only led to the firing of Pat Fitzgerald but also have made many wary of the program’s culture. Though NU is in an unprecedented place both Braun and its players earnestly appear to be proceeding full steam ahead with the upcoming season. Henning and Hagarty each shared that the team’s goal is to win the Big Ten Championship. Bryant added that the intention is for Northwestern to “flip the narrative” by performing well on the field. In terms of team bonding activities Braun mentioned that the program has been “very calculated” following its hazing education yet that the goal is still to “find ways to allow this team to build and become cohesive and have fun.” Hagarty and Bryant shared that non-football-related competitions start each day in the team auditorium from playing basketball to racing on Mario Kart. When asked about his team’s possible reception from fans on both sides in SHI Stadium Braun expressed uncertainty. However the defensive coordinator-turned-interim head coach sent a strong message about fan support in Evanston even in the midst of a fractured and divided base. “I certainly hope that this community our alumni all those that are associated with Northwestern University will come out and show full support for 103 young men that have worked their butts off” Braun shared. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After a summer of scandals left and right Northwestern appears to be moving in some form of a new direction. On Friday afternoon the school announced that Ben Greenspan would become its next head baseball coach. Greenspan previously served as the Michigan Wolverines’ associate head coach and recruiting coordinator and was hired in July 2022. Prior to coaching in Ann Arbor Greenspan was an assistant at Cal Poly and worked for Arizona State for seven seasons. In 2023 UM went 28-28 and 13-11 in conference play. Greenspan also coached at Indiana University — where he played — from 2009-14 and is a native of West Point New York. “I am honored and humbled to be selected as the next Head Baseball Coach at Northwestern” Greenspan said in an online release. “My personal and professional beliefs align with the mission and values of Northwestern University where academically oriented student-athletes strive for excellence on the field and in the classroom. My playing and coaching experience in the Big Ten has provided me with a knowledge of the fierce competition and excellence of the Conference. This is a challenge that I welcome.” Northwestern athletic director Derrick Gragg said he was “thrilled” to bring Greenspan to Evanston following an “extensive nationwide search.” “Ben’s experience and coaching prowess quickly set him apart within the candidate pool” Gragg said. “At each of his stops he has consistently showcased his ability to develop both players and programs. With a proven track record of recruiting top talent and fostering growth we’re confident Ben will lead our baseball program to new heights.” Greenspan helped coach MLB players Kyle Schwarber Spencer Torkelson Scott Effross Sam Travis and Alex Dickerson plus No. 18 overall prospect Brooks Lee (Minnesota Twins) New York Yankees No. 5 prospect Drew Thorpe and Pittsburgh Pirates No. 24 overall prospect Alika Williams. A source close to the Northwestern baseball program said he was “very excited for this program and for the players” adding “They’ve earned this.” Greenspan drew similarly positive praise around the country. “His reputation in the industry speaks for itself” Michigan head coach Tracy Smith said in a release. “He is ready for this opportunity! I can’t wait to see the impact he makes at his new school and the Big Ten Conference.” “The Greenspan family will be the perfect fit for the Northwestern Baseball program” Schwarber said. “BG’s knowledge of the game what it takes to win in the Big Ten/national stage and how to get the best performance out of his players are things that he will bring to Northwestern Baseball.” Greenspan’s hire comes on the heels of a 10-40 season for Northwestern in Foster’s lone year in Evanston. After reports of the toxic and abusive culture that Foster cultivated he was placed on “indefinite suspension” on July 13 and assistant coach Brian Anderson would “take leadership of the program.” A week ago Inside NU confirmed with multiple sources that Anderson would not be the team’s next head coach despite strong support from those in and around the program. Moreover those sources indicated that athletic director Derrick Gragg did not notify players of the decision. It is unknown whether or not Gragg told players and support staff prior to making the news public as well as if Anderson will be retained. Northwestern’s potential interest in Greenspan was first reported by MLB Network’s J.P. Morosi. Greenspan will become the fourth head coach in the last four years for NU which is seeking its first Big Ten Tournament appearance since 2017 and has not finished above .500 since 2000.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story In the midst of multiple scandals that have rocked Northwestern Athletics there is still one issue that NU has been facing for the past year: building the new Ryan Field.  The university’s plan to construct a new state-of-the-art facility has faced plenty of backlash from Evanston’s residents but Northwestern will still attempt to complete the $800 million renovation. With the Evanston Land Commission voting on the project in five days the first major hurdle for the renovation to clear here is everything you need to know about the new Ryan Field. The Basics In late September 2022 Northwestern revealed its plans for a new stadium to the public. The university said that the renovation is privately funded including $480 million donated by the Ryan family the largest single-time donation in NU history. While the current Ryan Field can seat 47000 fans the new stadium would reduce capacity to 35000 seats.  Much like the new Welsh-Ryan Arena the new Ryan Field will create a more intimate setting. Northwestern also said that the stadium will have a canopy at the top of the stadium protecting spectators from wind and rain. To pay for the stadium Northwestern originally proposed having 10 full-capacity concerts every year. Although the current stadium does not have permanent lighting the new stadium will be able to host nighttime events all year round. The original proposal also stated that NU could host an unlimited number of events of under 10000 people. In a letter to the Evanston community on Thursday Northwestern president Michael Schill said that the university would only seek six concerts a year and dropped its request for unlimited 10000-people-or-fewer events.  According to the stadium proposal Northwestern will build plazas around the stadium for community events such as holiday markets and movie nights. In his letter on Thursday Schill said NU would limit the number of community events in the Stadium and plaza to 60 days a year. Hoping to gain support from the community Northwestern released a study that said the new stadium will bring in tens of millions of dollars more than the current stadium; furthermore NU says its goal is for 35% of all stadium construction contracts would be awarded to minority and women-owned businesses in Evanston. Why is there pushback? If you ever drive around Evanston it is impossible to miss the ""eNoUgh"" signs planted in yards surrounding the stadium. Residents of Evanston’s seventh ward where the stadium is located and surrounding neighborhoods in Wilmette have attempted to halt the construction of the stadium. Residents are not concerned with the football and lacrosse games but with concert-goers flooding the neighborhood. Neighbors complain of traffic congestion and are worried the noise and light from concerts will keep them up at night. Neighbors were also concerned that Northwestern was not paying its fair share back to the community. Because the stadium was designated for “educational purposes"" Northwestern does not pay tax on the revenue it collects from the stadium. With the university proposing to hold concerts at the new venue residents wanted assurances that the community would see the benefits of the increased revenue. On Thursday Schill laid out NU’s financial plan to help Evanston. He said NU would guarantee $2 million to the city and surcharges on concert tickets will provide $50000 to local Evanston schools. Schill added that NU will host a $250000 event each year “that will benefit our entire community as directed by city leadership.” Furthermore in light of recent allegations of hazing inside the football program and the subsequent termination of Pat Fitzgerald whether NU would move ahead with the new stadium was up in the air. Fitzgerald was a huge part of creating the new stadium as the designs were drawn to his vision. Fitzgerald said that the new stadium would help create a home-field advantage for Northwestern and allow fans to be right on top of the field making a stadium of only 35000 feel much bigger. Fitz was even at the original reveal of the new stadium in September alongside President Schill and was constantly around campus and the community rallying support for the new stadium. With Fitz no longer at the helm of the program Northwestern no longer had a face of the renovation. Also following Fitzgerald’s firing and the hazing allegations over 260 members of Northwestern’s faculty asked the university to not move forward with the new stadium until “this crisis is satisfactorily resolved.”   Northwestern made some concessions on Thursday lowering the number of events it originally asked to hold; however some community organizers are still not satisfied and have concerns. “Northwestern knows it is losing the battle of public opinion” David DeCarlo president of the Most Livable City Association said in a statement. “So they sprung this updated proposal less than a week before the Land Use Commission hearing with their characteristic stealth. Still seeking a radical zoning change and failing to address environmental financial and labor concerns with the stadium rebuild this ‘offer’ is nothing but a fig leaf in NU’s quest to remake entire neighborhoods and disrupt life in Evanston and beyond.” What’s Next? The New Ryan Field is scheduled for its first vote on Aug. 23 in front of the Evanston Land Use Commission. Northwestern will seek to change the zoning of the stadium to a for-profit venue allowing the stadium to host concerts. If the vote passes the stadium would be up for a vote by the Evanston City Council in September. If the council votes to approve the stadium which is still a major if NU can begin demolition of the current stadium and construction of the new facility. It is widely speculated that Northwestern plans to tear down the current stadium at the conclusion of the 2023 football season.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After a 16-5-2 season that saw them make the Sweet 16 not much has changed for the Wildcats. Most of the starters are returning but a few notable departures leave questions going  into 2023. We break down our three biggest here: #1: How do the ‘Cats fill the role of Rowan Lapi? Northwestern is returning a majority of its production from 2022 but one major departure was Rowan Lapi. The midfielder scored six goals while dishing out three assists across 23 starts but this season her cat of choice will be a Nittany Lion rather than a Wildcat. The loss of an All-Big Ten Second Teamer is major so the ‘Cats will need to figure out their strategy going forward. Offensively Northwestern is in good hands (or feet). The ‘Cats are returning four out of their five top goalscorers and 84% of their total goalscoring production so there shouldn’t be much disruption there. The defensive side of the ball is where any transitionary pains may occur. Lapi was a force defensively acting as a sweeper in front of the backline handling all loose balls and dominating aerial duels. Keeping the backline intact should keep Lapi’s departure from being a major issue but the midfield will need to step up. Incoming transfer Jaelyn Eisenhart who is listed as a defender/midfielder should contribute to that cause. They do say that the best defense is a good offense though so that could be a possible workaround as well. That strategy certainly worked in the season opener at Marquette which the ‘Cats won 4-0. #2: Who will be between the sticks? Last season Northwestern’s goal was kept secure by grad transfer Mia Raben but there was always a dwindling timer on that successful relationship. There are two likely replacements for the Wildcats one of whom was already on the roster and one who is following the Raben model. The first option is sophomore Reiley Fitzpatrick who is looking to take over the starting role after featuring heavily in the first half of the 2022 season. In 495 minutes played Fitzpatrick made five saves while allowing four goals on 28 shots faced. She is familiar with the lakeside environment of Martin Stadium and the program as a whole. Her year of experience could give her a leg up in the keeper competition. The second option is graduate transfer Gina Muzi. A Wisconsin native Muzi returns closer to home after time spent at Portland and St. John’s. At St. John’s – her most recent stop – Muzi made 19 starts with 42 saves and 16 goals allowed. If she can mesh with the Northwestern backline as Raben did she has a solid chance at the starting job. If coach Michael Moynihan’s strategy is similar to last year there could be an element of goalkeeping by committee. In 2022 both Raben and Fitzpatrick played the first 11 games of the season before Raben took over full time. This season is off to a similar start. Fitzpatrick received the start going 82 minutes before Muzi came on to finish the game. A definitive answer on this season’s keeper likely won’t come until conference play begins in September. #3: Will there be another breakout first-year? While there were plenty of different reasons for Northwestern’s success last season the emergence of the eventual Big Ten Freshman of the Year was definitely a major factor. Caterina Regazzoni made 22 starts in her first campaign with the Wildcats scoring three goals and delivering three assists. Her abilities were made known from the get-go as she scored the very first goal of the season for the ‘Cats. This production from a first-year who made the All-Big Ten Third and Freshman teams gave Northwestern the opportunity to improve its offensive prowess which worked out well. With only one major gap in the starting lineup will 2023 see another first-year step up? Early signs point toward Holland Carey as a possible candidate. The midfielder got the start in the season opener at Marquette playing 79 minutes and registering an assist. It only took until her first touch to get involved as she played the through ball to Meg Boade that eventually ended up as an Ella Hase first-minute goal. The Marquette game offered a few other options as well. Forward Megan Norkett and defender Keira Wagner both played at least 20 minutes with both first-years recording a shot in their first collegiate appearance. If Northwestern can add another scoring threat or sound defender from this new class the team will be in a good spot not only in 2023 but over the next few years as well. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Basics Returning Production: 65% overall (55% offense 75% defense); T-52nd 2022 Record: 11-2 (7-2 B1G Rose Bowl champions) Head Coach: James Franklin (10th season) The Stats The following metrics are courtesy of Bill Connelly and ESPN. You can read more about the rankings and theory behind them here. 2023 SP+ Overall: 6th 2023 SP+ Offense: 22nd 2023 SP+ Defense: 5th 2022 Capsule After two straight down years in State College the Nittany Lions returned to full-fledged glory in 2022 posting their highest win total since 2019. PSU started the year unranked but following a gritty 35-31 win at Purdue and a trouncing of Ohio it secured a spot in the AP Top 25 that it would not relinquish. The Nittany Lions maintained their hot start with a 41-12 domination of Auburn in Jordan-Hare Stadium and they roared to a 5-0 record subsequent to a sloppy rain-soaked win over Northwestern. Reaching No. 10 in the poll Franklin’s squad ventured to the Big House to take on No. 5 Michigan. In an early test the Wolverines got the best of their East rivals with UM rushing to a gaudy 418 yards and four scores en route to a 41-17 win. Penn State bounced back against Minnesota the next week beating the Golden Gophers handily at 45-17 in the team’s Whiteout game. But another litmus test emerged against the No. 2 Ohio State Buckeyes. Despite a great battle the Nittany Lions fell 44-31 dropping to 6-2. From that point on PSU did not lose a game the rest of the 2022 season garnering wins over Indiana Maryland Rutgers and Michigan State to finish inside the top 10 and earn its first Rose Bowl trip since 2016. Taking on No. 7 Utah in Pasadena freshman Nicholas Singleton rumbled for 120 yards and two scores and an efficient Sean Clifford closed out his college career with Rose Bowl MVP honors going 16-for-21 with 279 yards two touchdowns and no interceptions. PSU won its first Rose Bowl since 1994 and it left many bullish about the team’s future for 2023 and beyond. Offensive Overview Following 51 games played and a team-record 10661 passing yards and 86 touchdowns Clifford will not be under center in blue and white. With Clifford moving on to the NFL it is widely expected that former five-star prospect Drew Allar will take the reins. Allar played in 10 of PSU’s contests last year but threw just 60 passes primarily in relief of Clifford or due to an injury to the starter. The sophomore from Medina Ohio flashed his premier arm talent pocket mobility and athleticism in spurts last year but should have an opportunity to do so on a full-time basis in 2023. In its backfield Penn State boasts two of the better running backs in the conference in Singleton and Kaytron Allen both of whom are only sophomores. The pair combined for 1928 yards and 22 touchdowns the former of which ranked second in the Big Ten — behind only Michigan’s Blake Corum and Donovan Edwards. At receiver PSU loses its top two options from a year ago in Parker Washington and Mitchell Tinsley. However KeAndre Lambert-Smith has generated buzz entering his junior season; the wideout averaged a ridiculous 16.2 yards per catch last year garnering 389 total yards. Additionally transfer Dante Cephas (Kent State) should provide experience with 2139 total receiving yards. At tight end the Nittany Lions saw Brenton Strange depart to the pros but Theo Johnson proved to be a solid receiving option as a backup last year. Along its offensive line the Nittany Lions boast left tackle Olu Fashanu viewed as the top O-lineman in the sport. The yet-to-be 21-year-old did not allow a sack last year and was considered a surefire top-10 pick before electing to return to Happy Valley. In addition to returning Fashanu PSU gets back 2022 starters Sal Wormley Hunter Nourzad and Caedan Wallace. Yet the team must brace the loss of veteran center Juice Scruggs. Defensive Overview Penn State solidified itself as one of the best defenses in the country last year. In Manny Diaz’s first year as defensive coordinator the Nittany Lions allowed only 18.2 points per game — which was 10th-best in the country — ranked 15th in defensive EPA/play and collected 26 takeaways. PSU’s front seven was a force to be reckoned with totaling 321 pressures — the most in the Power Five — plus a conference-best 43 sacks. That dominance should continue in 2023 with the team bringing back sack leader Abdul Carter Chop Robinson Adisa Isaac and Dani Dennis-Sutton. At linebacker Diaz retains standout Curtis Jacobs who posted four sacks and 7.5 tackles for loss a year ago. Jacobs and Carter will be joined by Kobe King who earned a career-best 79.3 Pro Football Focus grade in the Rose Bowl. PSU will lose Joey Porter Jr. in its secondary who went 32nd overall in this year’s NFL Draft plus longtime playmaker Ji’Ayir Brown at safety. However there’s no shortage of talent for Diaz in the back-end. Cornerback Kalen King has been touted as a preseason first-round pick and was named to the Bednarik and Thorpe Award watch list. Moreover corner Johnny Dixon safety Keaton Ellis and safety Jaylen Reed provide experience each having played 390+ snaps a year ago. Ultimately five of PSU’s projected starters on defense were named to PFF’s preseason All-Big Ten list and that’s not a coincidence. The unit figures to be one of the most formidable in the nation for a second straight year. Three Players to Watch QB Drew Allar 2023 will undoubtedly provide a changing of the guard for Penn State’s offense without Clifford under center. However that modification could actually prove to be an upgrade. While Clifford was a sage veteran for Franklin having just a 2.2% Turnover-Worthy Play mark in 2022 — tied for 16th-best among QBs to throw 300 or more times last year — he also arguably left points on the field.  Throughout last year fans had clamored to see Allar’s talent especially following miscues or errant throws by Clifford. The most snaps that Allar played in a game was 31 against Indiana but it was easy to glean his potential and poise in a limited window. Allar ranked the 13th-best recruit in PSU history by 247 Sports can legitimately take the Nittany Lions from a stellar team to one contending for the national championship. Having a blue-chip quarterback has tended to align with teams winning the College Football Playoff and Penn State should boast just that in the sophomore. EDGE Chop Robinson Robinson has drawn considerable hype before this year if for nothing but his rugged old-school gameday look with no accoutrements — including no gloves. The Maryland transfer paced the Nittany Lions with 48 pressures a year ago and he collected 10 tackles for loss 5.5 sacks a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. What fuels Robinson’s on-field success is his outrageous athleticism. Robinson ranked ninth on Bruce Feldman’s annual Freaks List reportedly running a 4.47 40-yard dash and broad jumping 10 feet 7 inches at 6-foot-3 250 pounds. Expect Robinson to be the best edge rusher in the Big Ten for a second straight season and to pair with defensive cornerstone King to make plays for the Nittany Lions when they need them most. WR KeAndre Lambert-Smith As mentioned earlier Lambert-Smith was effectively fourth on Clifford’s receiving pecking order last year. However without Washington playing in the Rose Bowl Lambert-Smith put his skill on full display. No. 1 led the victorious Nittany Lions with 124 receiving yards including an 88-yard touchdown strike to begin the fourth quarter — which was the longest touchdown pass in the fabled history of the game. Lambert-Smith has looked the part of a top wideout in offseason workouts with Franklin saying “We need him to be the guy like a true No. 1 not just at Penn State but really in the conference.” If the Nittany Lions want to achieve their CFP-clad goals they’ll need the former four-star to emerge in full force this year. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Next up in Inside NU’s preseason coverage of field hockey is a familiar face. At least she very well should be. Peyton Halsey has played in every game for the Wildcat’s over her last four seasons and Northwestern is unbelievably lucky to return the reigning captain for another year.  Who is she? Graduate student; midfield; from Reading Pa.; 2022 team captain. Career Stats 3281 minutes over 88 games; 23 goals; 57 points; .599 SOG% 2022 Review Peyton Halsey is a member of a very small group of collegiate athletes who have played in every single game of their career. Halsey is the definition of a staple player which was more than evident in her senior season. As if starting all 25 games was not enough she totaled 1283 minutes — the third most on the midfield.  The captain is an incredibly effective player which is why she played such an eye-catching amount of minutes. Her .625 SOG% was the highest of players with at least 20 shots and Halsey’s 13 goals and 30 points were second to only Bente Baekers with no one close behind.  Halsey is an overall dominant player but one area where she is an exceptionally unparalleled talent is on penalty strokes which she recorded five goals off of. The Pennsylvania native had a particular career game against Penn State where she scored two goals in a matter of minutes in the fourth quarter to tie the game before finishing off the comeback in overtime with a penalty stroke. Three other penalty goals came in the postseason: a walk-off against No. 18 Rutgers in the Big 10 quarterfinals along with ones in the Big Ten semifinals against No. 2 Maryland and in the first round of the NCAA’s against Miami (Ohio). If her senior season proved anything it’s that Halsey will dedicate herself to every minute of every game and it’ll pay off.  Expectations So long as she’s healthy 2023 is the season of Peyton Halsey. With no Baekers Halsey is primed to be leading this team in goals and points which should surprise no one. Her last season has the potential to be marked by offensive power.  Halsey will do it all and give it her all as she always has. She may just end up being featured in every single Northwestern field hockey match in the last five years.  There is no doubt that Halsey has meant a lot to this team over her tenure — that was proven by her being named a captain her senior year. To have her return for a fifth year is no small feat; head coach Tracy Fuchs gets to return an immense talent and a proven leader.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story With the season kicking off in under one week Northwestern volleyball will look to change the narrative surrounding the program and prove that it can compete with the powerhouses of Big Ten volleyball. The ‘Cats have reloaded their roster for the upcoming season and will attempt to end a 35-year drought of a winning Big Ten record. The Wildcats have their work cut out losing top talent from their 2022 campaign. Furthermore NU’s offseason was full of controversy highlighted by a lawsuit about alleged hazing by head coach Shane Davis which Inside NU was able to confirm. With the ‘Cats about to return to the floor here is everything you need to know heading into the 2023 season. The Basics 2022 Record: 18-14 (7-13 B1G) Head Coach: Shane Davis (8th season) Setters: Sienna Noordermeer (So.) Alexa Rousseau (Sr) Libero: Ellee Stinson (Jr.)  Middle Blocker: Leilani Dodson (Sr.) Kennedy Hill (So.) Outside Hitter: Natalie Chizzo (Sr.) Averie Hernandez (So.) Ariel Amaya (Jr.) Kathryn Randorf (So.) Key Losses: Temi Thomas-Ailara (Transfer-Wisconsin) Desiree Becker (Transfer-UCLA) Hanna Lesiak (Transfer-Long Beach State) Abryanna Cannon (Transfer-South Alabama) Tatyana Hardwick (Graduated) Megan Miller (Graduated) Olivia Haskins (Graduated) Ella Grbac (Graduated) Charlotte Cronister (Transfer-UNC Wilmington) Grace Reninga (Transfer-Johns Hopkins) New Additions: Gigi Navarrete (Fy.) Drew Wright (Fy.) Ellie Husemann (Minnesota) Maddy Chinn (Purdue) Rylen Reid (Florida Gulf Coast) Julia Sangiacomo (Santa Clara) Lauren Carter (Denver) 2022 Capsule Northwestern fired out of the gates last year finishing 11-1 in non-conference play to start the season. As the ‘Cats began Big Ten play they came to quickly realize that it is much harder to win conference matchups. The Wildcats were swept in their first two conference games of the season before traveling to Minneapolis to take on No. 7 Minnesota. After a back-and-forth match NU captured the fifth set and victory over the Golden Gophers the highest-ranked road win in program history. Following the upset Northwestern lost four out of its five next matches with its lone win against Rutgers. During that stretch Rousseau the team’s prominent setter went down with an injury that sidelined her for the next month. The Wildcats got back on track after the skid winning four straight matches including an upset over No. 12 Purdue. The ‘Cats almost pulled off the biggest upset of program history being just two points away from knocking off national powerhouse Nebraska but eventually fell to the Huskers in five sets.  Furthermore the ‘Cats suffered a loss that impacted their season more than just one game could. In the fifth set Noordermeer who had replaced the injured Rousseau and had a stellar freshman season hit her head on the bleachers diving after a ball concussing herself and ending her season leaving NU without a setter. With the Wildcats still in the mix for an NCAA Tournament berth they would need to stay hot down the stretch to secure their spot; however that did not happen. Northwestern lost its next five matchups effectively ending its postseason hopes. The Wildcats picked up a win against Illinois on Senior Day to close out the 2022 season. Offensive Overview  Northwestern’s offense will have to find its way after suffering heavy losses this offseason. All-American Thomas-Ailara who led the Big Ten in kills last season transferred to Wisconsin this offseason and a multitude of the ‘Cats’ attackers also departed Evanston. Entering 2023 NU has reloaded its roster and will have to find the right combination to score enough points. The Wildcats will turn to their highly rated 2022 recruiting class to take a big step from their first season and carry the ‘Cats to victory. Look for Randorf to be NU’s top attacker and Hernandez and Hill to come into their own in their first season of meaningful minutes. Furthermore Northwestern turned to the transfer portal to replenish its offensive losses. The Wildcats added four attackers including three graduate students. Sangiacomo and Chinn bring veteran experience to the program and will help the ‘Cats attack. Defensive Overview Northwestern lost its two defensive superstars Miller and Becker this offseason so the ‘Cats will need to quickly figure out how to defend against Big Ten attackers. Stinson who had 322 digs last season should slide into the starting lineup this season. Dodson will take over as the Wildcats’ top blocker in 2023 and Purdue transfer Chinn will provide support on the defensive side. Northwestern will have to limit its number of errors to compete this season. NU had 174 receiving errors giving multiple free points to the opponents. If NU can play clean volleyball the Wildcats can compete with the top teams in the Big Ten. Three Players to Watch Setter Alexa Rousseau Healthy for her senior season Rousseau will be a key cog on the floor for the ‘Cats’ season. The setter makes her teammates look good delivering the ball with ease. Despite missing a month last year No. 5 still led the team in assists with 813. In the Wildcats’ upset over the Gophers Rousseau tallied 52 assists. Entering her senior season Rousseau is six assists away from 2000 and she should enter the top ten in Wildcats’ history in assists at the conclusion of the 2023 season. Rousseau will be a leader on and off the floor for the ‘Cats and if she can stay healthy will be a large reason for any success the Wildcats have. Outside Hitter Kathryn Randorf The former Ohio Gatorade Player of the Year made her impact felt instantly in her inaugural season earning a spot on the All-Big Ten Freshman Team. Randorf collected 256 kills in her first year in purple and white including 13 in the ‘Cats’ upset over No. 12 Purdue. Standing 6-foot-1 Randorf’s wingspan allows her to meet the ball at its highest point before slamming it down on her opponents. With TTA moving north to Wisconsin Randorf will need to take a big step forward and score with authority to help the ‘Cats win games. Outside Hitter Julia Sangiacomo Sangiacomo comes to Evanston after spending four years at Santa Clara. She has over 1500 career kills including 475 last season. In 2022 she reached double-digit kills 26 times including eight games of 20+ kills. To be frank she is an offensive weapon. At 6-foot-5 Sangiacomo is able to get to any ball and the ball comes off her palm like a heat-seeking missile. It is safe to assume that the graduate transfer will see plenty of action this season and she will be a huge portion of the Wildcats’ offensive success in 2023.    \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

Share this story Having already taken a deep dive into five of Northwestern’s 2023 opponents let’s keep chugging along with NU’s only FCS opponent this season: Howard. The Basics 2022 Record: 5-6 (4-1 MEAC) Head Coach: Larry Scott (4th season) The Stats The following metrics are courtesy of Bill Connelly’s model. You can read more about the rankings and theory behind them here. 2022 SP+ Overall (FCS): 87th 2022 SP+ Offense (FCS): 86th 2022 SP+ Defense (FCS): 102nd 2022 Capsule Following a 2-8 season in 2021 the Bison looked to bounce back in 2022 under Scott’s second full season in charge. But the season started off poorly with three straight losses to Alabama State Hampton and USF by a combined 96-61 margin. The only close game out of the trio was against Hampton where the Bison trailed 21-6 heading into the final frame before a 22 point stampede made things interesting. Nonetheless Howard couldn’t convert a crucial onside kick late letting Hampton walk away victorious. In their fourth game of the year the Bison found their stride against Morehouse in the HBCU NYC Classic. After a gritty first half ended scoreless Howard exploded for 31 second-half points thanks to a tenacious defensive effort and the connection between QB Quinton Williams and now former WR Antoine Murray who hauled in eight catches for 116 yards and two touchdowns. But even with the dominant win in the rearview mirror Howard found more struggles against Ivy League competition. Trailing by two scores heading into the fourth quarter against Yale the Bison’s 13 points in the fourth weren’t enough to get the job done. Adding insult to injury Howard’s home opener was spoiled after a 24-8 second half push by Harvard killed any hopes of the Bison getting a second tally in the win column. Against MEAC competition though the Bison started to look dangerous. Thanks to 272 yards on the ground Howard beat Delaware St. 35-17 to capture its second win of the season. A game later against Norfolk State the Bison continued to ride their running backs storming for 146 rushing yards en route to a dominant 49-21 win while taking the crown as the only unbeaten team left in MEAC play. Despite the back-to-back wins Howard fell 50-21 against North Carolina Central before closing out the season with two wins against South Carolina State and Morgan State. In the Bison’s last two wins Jarrett Hunter and Williams were standouts with the former tallying 192 all-purpose yards against SC State and the latter tossing two touchdowns rushing for one and catching another against Morgan State. The tandem helped the Bison earn a share of the MEAC regular season title their first championship since 1993. Offensive Overview Last season a balanced offensive attack switching between the run and the pass based on opponents’ strengths was the Bison way. Expect more of the same with Howard’s starting quarterback Williams and second- third- and fourth- most prolific pass catchers in Nah’shawn Hezekiah Kasey Hawthorne and Richie Ilarraza returning. Add in a strong three-headed punch of Jarrett Hunter Eden James and Ian Wheeler in the Bison backfield this season and Howard has three rushers that combined for over 1300 yards on the ground last year. But against Northwestern expect to see more of the pass. With the losses of Cam Mitchell A.J. Hampton and Jeremiah Lewis in the offseason the ‘Cats are much thinner on the back end. Plus with the struggles of linebackers Bryce Gallagher and Xander Mueller in pass coverage the Bison would be smart to move the ball through the air. Specifically look for the Bison to target Hezekiah and Hawthorne. At 6-foot-2 210 pounds Hezekiah has the frame to go up and make plays. Finishing with 26 catches 299 yards and three touchdowns last year look for the South Carolina native to get a fair share of Williams’ red zone targets. Hawthorne a 2023 preseason All-MEAC First Team selection racked up 31 catches 293 yards and a touchdown in 2022. At 5-foot-11 195 pounds Hawthorne’s speed and athleticism provide a nice complement to the length of Hezekiah for Williams through the air. Defensive Overview Defensively Howard struggled last season giving up over 25 points a game good for fourth in the MEAC out of six teams. Plus the defense only mustered 21 sacks in 11 games leaving more to be desired in terms of getting to the quarterback. Howard’s run defense wasn’t much better allowing 4.9 yards on the ground per attempt and 167.5 yards per game. Even without Evan Hull in 2023 the ‘Cats have capable runners in Cam Porter and Anthony Tyus III who’ll look to be effective against Howard’s porous run defense. The good news for the Bison however is they boasted the MEAC’s best pass defense surrendering only 11 touchdowns through the air while holding opposing quarterbacks to just 54.9% accuracy. Plus Howard returns four of its five best tacklers from last season in Kenny Gallop Jr. Terrance Hollon Christian White and Jevin Jackson. Hollon also led the team in interceptions hauling in two from his home at linebacker in the heart of the Bison defense. Three Players to Watch QB Quinton Williams Williams now a graduate student was named an All-MEAC Second Team selection as a senior last season. Playing in 10 games the Maryland native threw for 1906 yards 16 touchdowns and eight interceptions on nearly 65% accuracy. Not only did he throw for 200 yards five times but also had at least two touchdown tosses in six games too. Williams also has the ability to run the football rushing for 172 yards and 4 touchdowns in 2022. A true dual threat signal caller Northwestern will need to keep close tabs on Williams’ versatility under center. DB Kenny Gallop Jr. A star in the making for Howard Gallop Jr. earned a spot on the 2022 Phil Steele FCS All-MEAC First Team and was named to the 2023 Preseason All-MEAC First Team after finishing second in the MEAC last year with 89 total tackles from his spot in the secondary. Gallop has a nose for the football ending 2022 with at least six tackles in every game 7.5 tackles for loss a forced fumble and four pass breakups. Simply said the Virginia native not only does everything but is everywhere for Howard’s defense making him the Bison’s best defensive asset. OT Anim Dankwah Listed at 6-foot-8 362 pounds it’s a little hard not to know who Dankwah is when he’s on the field. Another Preseason All-MEAC First Team selection the behemoth of a left tackle is trying to build off an All-MEAC First Team season in 2022 where he started all 11 games. With excellent size and strength Dankwah is a force in the run game. A people-mover look for Howard to run behind its mammoth left tackle on the ground. In pass protection Dankwah is still raw with his footwork and hand placement but has improved every year of his collegiate career. However don’t be surprised if Northwestern tries to attack him with speed something the Ontario native has struggled with in the past. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story It’s almost fall. The leaves will change color the temperatures will get cooler and yes for many that means football — but at Northwestern it also means it’s time for one of the school’s best programs to take the field. After not having made it past the Final Four in 46 seasons Northwestern won its first championship in 2021 and made it to the final game once again last season. Here are some questions the Wildcats will need to address as they look to continue their streak of success. 1. What does the offense look like without Bente Baekers?  Baekers helped propel Northwestern to a top-10 offense scoring 25 of the team’s 62 goals. The four-time All-American led the nation in goals and ranked second in points. Statistics like that were not just a feature of an experienced player as the Netherlands native had led the ‘Cats in points and goals for the past four seasons. No matter how talented of a pitch Tracey Fuchs fields the absence of Baekers clearly creates a gaping hole — a testament to her talent and becoming well one of the all-time greatest collegiate field hockey players. The answer to how to create another top offense lies in returning players. Peyton Halsey has the potential to be the offensive leader this season. With 13 goals and 30 assists no other player aside from Baekers who led in these categories stands close. While the reigning captain has big expectations waiting for her Lauren Wadas who had six goals in 2022 could step up to become a more frequent scorer. Another player who may have a breakout season and establish herself is Lane Herbert. The junior faced limited minutes last season but still managed four goals in 666 minutes over 25 games.  Northwestern is used to having a top-tier attack and while there are many players who can easily help tally goals Baekers is not easily replaceable. 2. Who will step up on defense? Northwestern’s defense loses two notable players in Shannon Daley and Kayla Blas. The two backs helped anchor the defense in front of Annabel Skubisz along with midfielder Alia Marshall. Having two such experienced players in that position was not something the ‘Cats took for granted in their back-to-back championship appearances. In particular Blas was a player constantly on the field. Her 1548 minutes were second to only Skubisz and were 79 minutes more than Ana Medina Garcia who ranked third last season.  With one of the best goalkeepers in the country returning for her senior year the Wildcats are fortunate but a few backs will step up and face a steep incline in minutes this season. Northwestern does have Marshall a midfield and back returning for her fifth year. She had the second-most assists on the team last season behind Blas and can be expected to log plenty of more. But eyes will be on who is playing exclusively as a back and standing near Skubisz. Lauren Hunter has logged a decent amount of field time albeit not as a starter appearing in every game over her first two seasons. Maja Zivojnovic started off her first year strong starting the first 11 games of the season before getting injured.  Hunter and Zivojnovic will likely claim the starting back positions and as a junior and sophomore it could be nice to have some ‘Cats who are bound to be back garner that experience.  3. Two titles in three seasons? There are lots of expectations for certain players and a standard for the type of field hockey Northwestern is supposed to excel at. But at the end of the day all these intended achievements come down to one thing: the belief that Northwestern can win another championship. Last season ended in heartbreak. North Carolina scored in the second quarter and it wasn’t until there was a minute and 59 seconds left that Baekers delivered the ‘Cats their first goal of the game to even the score. But as the momentum seemed it would change for NU the opposite happened and Erin Matson delivered the game-winner — the season winner — less than a minute later. Teams can’t live in the past but this chip on the Wildcats’ shoulders isn’t going anywhere. With a combination of pure talent and determination to avenge last season a second championship in three years is what this team is aiming for.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Despite having been at the school since 2018 the hometown hero had still failed to put forth a winning record. Unfortunately for Frost it ended up being never. Despite a promising performance from transfer quarterback Casey Thompson Nebraska blew a pair of double-digit leads to Northwestern in Ireland in a 31-28 loss. The game was arguably the best single-game characterization of Frost’s tenure at the school and its momentum flipped to Northwestern after a mind-numbingly disastrous onside kick attempt from the Cornhuskers. Three weeks later after a 45-42 loss to Sun Belt team Georgia Southern (in which the Nebraska defense gave up 642 total yards) Frost was canned. He was replaced by another former Nebraska quarterback wide receivers coach Mickey Joseph. After getting blown out by Oklahoma the Cornhuskers rebounded under Joseph winning games against Indiana and Rutgers.  The defense’s issues would continue to plague the Cornhuskers though with Purdue and Illinois dropping a combined 69 points on Nebraska to drop Big Red to 3-4 entering November. The losing streak would stretch to five games after a blowout loss to Michigan was sandwiched in between two close grueling losses to Minnesota and Wisconsin. Despite all of that the Cornhuskers ended the season on a high note. On November 25 they stunned the Iowa Hawkeyes in Iowa defeating their border rivals for the first time since 2014. Thompson threw for 278 yards and three touchdowns and Trey Palmer was responsible for 165 of those en route to setting a school record for receiving yards in a season. The next day Nebraska officially hired Matt Rhule as head coach. The Rhule hiring was probably the most consequential coaching decision the school had made since firing Frank Solich back in 2003. Rhule compiled a pair of 10-win seasons at Temple then won 11 games and a Big 12 division title at Baylor in 2019 before becoming the head coach of the Carolina Panthers. While he flamed out after three years in the NFL with an 11-27 record he has a history of turning around troubled programs in college. Cornhusker fans are hoping their program is next. Offensive Overview One thing’s for sure: Rhule will have his work cut out for him. Casey Thompson the team’s leading passer departed for FAU in the transfer portal. Anthony Grant last year’s leading rusher was suspended for the start of spring practice. Trey Palmer the first-ever Nebraska receiver to crack the 1000-yard barrier is now making a name for himself in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ preseason. Marcus Washington the team’s second-leading receiver last year only began practicing fully two weeks ago after a summer hand injury. However some new faces will likely help the Huskers stay on their feet offensively. Jeff Sims the new quarterback transferred in from Georgia Tech in the offseason. Sims started seven games last year for the Yellow Jackets before a season-ending injury and tallied over 1400 total yards and six touchdowns. Some of the receivers he’ll be throwing to include Billy Kemp IV who totaled over 1770 receiving yards in his Virginia career and Arik Gilbert who joins Nebraska after winning two national titles with Georgia.  Despite the new additions there are also plenty of familiar faces especially in the running back room. Grant is back and is joined by Rahmir Johnson who rushed for 495 yards in 2021 and Gabe Ervin Jr. who has shown flashes in two injury-plagued seasons. On Saturday Rhule said that Ervin will be the lead back assuming he can stay healthy. For a team that finished 100th in the country in rushing yardage last season continuity will be key in setting up a consistent ground attack. Defensive Overview The defense is also going to struggle with replacing talent especially on the line. Garrett Nelson a team captain and second-team All-Big Ten player last year is now on the Miami Dolphins. Ochuan Mathis is now on the Rams and Colton Feist who finished third on the line in tackles with 46 did not return to the team. The best returning defensive lineman Ty Robinson finished last season with 24 tackles and a pair of sacks. He’ll be key in helping the younger players and transfers get used to the new 3-4 formation that defensive coordinator Tony White brings over from Syracuse.  The linebackers bring back a few more key returners. Luke Reimer and Nick Henrich were starters last year and they’ll be starters again this year. The duo looks to combine for even more tackles than the mark of 123 they put up last year. Some of the other linebackers like John Bullock or Grant Tagge do have game experience but it’s primarily on special teams.  In the defensive backfield room the ‘Huskers return a slew of talent. Marques Buford Jr. and Malcolm Hartzog the only Cornhuskers with multiple interceptions last year are back as is Quinton Newsome who had 44 tackles and 10 pass breakups last season. Senior Omar Brown and junior Deshon Singleton also saw plenty of action in 2022 and with all that returning talent there’s an argument that defensive back is Nebraska’s deepest position this year. Three Players to Know QB Jeff Sims As Sims goes so go the Huskers. The Georgia Tech transfer is arguably a top-five quarterback in the conference but there is no guarantee that he’ll light the world on fire. He is after all learning a new system and coming off of an injury. The bigger problem for Sims though is turnovers. In his three seasons of action at Georgia Tech Sims threw for 30 touchdowns — but also 23 interceptions. In his abbreviated 2022 season the ratio was just 5-to-3. His freshman year 2020 was even wilder as he finished 3rd in the NCAA with 13 interceptions. Despite concerns over protecting the football the Cornhusker offense appears to be in capable hands with Sims. According to DC Tony White who faced off against Sims while at Syracuse the quarterback is better than ever and has a dual-threat ability that can confound defenses. While Sims may not always break the 300-yard barrier just by throwing the ball his mobility could push him over that edge by total yardage especially if an experienced offensive line gets better as the season goes on. OL Teddy Prochazka Prochazka is a Nebraska kid and was the No. 73 overall prospect in the Class of 2020. He also had offers from schools like Michigan and Iowa off the heels of consecutive all-state seasons and a runner-up finish at the Nebraska football state tournament. With a pedigree like that it’s no wonder Prochazka was the 16th true freshman to play on the Cornhusker offensive line. And he did more than just play. In the 2021 63-7 humiliation of Northwestern he became the seventh true freshman in the modern era of Nebraska football to start on the offensive line when he earned the starting left tackle spot. In that game the Cornhuskers totaled 427 rushing yards and Prochazka was key in that. A game later he earned the start against ninth-ranked Michigan but suffered a season-ending injury in that contest. In 2022 Prochazka was a Day 1 starter. He kept that job all season — well all of his season. He suffered a second consecutive season-ending injury in the Georgia Southern game just the third game of the year. He’s once again likely to take the starting left tackle job especially if his body manages to not betray him for a third straight year. If he does stay healthy then defensive linemen better be careful lest they find themselves getting pancaked by the 6’10” 320-pound Nebraskan mountain. LB Luke Reimer The main man on the defense last year Reimer will be at the forefront of the Nebraska defense this year as well. Last year the linebacker made his second consecutive all-Big Ten honorable mention after leading the team with 83 tackles. He reached that mark despite missing a pair of games. Had Reimer been healthy the number could have been closer to his 2021 mark of 108 tackles. He currently sits at 15th in Nebraska history with 245 career tackles and could see that number shoot way up this year. He’s not just a tackler though. Reimer garnered five pass breakups in 2021 and six in 2022 showcasing his smarts and his nose for the ball. He also can beat offensive linemen with regularity as his 9.5 tackles for loss over the last two years showcase.  Aside from being a leading tackler Reimer is also a leader. He was one of the first four Cornhuskers to earn a single-digit number (Reimer chose No.4) which Rhule gives out to players who “exemplify what it means to be a Cornhusker.” The honor was voted on by Reimer’s teammates but there was no doubt that the man who’s played in 38 collegiate games would earn it. He’ll probably be slightly less popular with offenses if they can’t account for him this season.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story A 16-5-2 record with a Sweet 16 appearance is nothing to balk at but that was last year. It is on to a new campaign for Northwestern women’s soccer and with it comes new players and new challenges. Repeating 2022’s success is possible and these keys to success can help the ‘Cats achieve that goal. Dominate possession Last season Northwestern was able to have a dangerous offense and a stout defense simultaneously. The reason for that aside from the obvious quality of the players on the pitch was the Wildcat’s domination of the possession game. Controlling possession allows Northwestern’s talented offense the opportunity to create and make threatening runs while also preventing the opponent from having any time to develop a coherent attack of their own.  The burden of maintaining and regaining possession usually lies with the midfield. Meg Boade and Caterina Regazzoni have shown their ability to collect loose balls and intercept passes but other midfielders will need to step up to cover the loss of Rowan Lapi. Challenging on 50-50 balls and winning aerial duels will be crucial for the ‘Cats in their effort to control possession. Spread out the scoring This Northwestern offense has a number of capable goalscorers namely Josie Aulicino (nine goals in 2022) and Meg Boade (seven goals in 2022). However they will not be able to do all the scoring alone. In 2022 the Wildcats had 12 different players score goals 10 of whom are still on the team. Spreading out the scoring allows the offense to be a constant threat. If multiple players can score opposing defenses will never know where to look or who to mark.  Distribution will play a major role in allowing plenty of ‘Cats to find the back of the net. Last season Northwestern registered 46 assists on 44 goals. Strong facilitation sets players up for easy scores so through balls and effective wing play will be key. The program record for goals in a season sits at 52 set in the 1997 season. That number could be topped this year but it will take a team effort. Maintain defensive excellence The defense was a calling card for the ‘Cats last season. They allowed 18 goals which was fourth lowest total in the Big Ten. This year the entire back line of Danika Austin Emma Phillips and Nicole Doucette return and they will be bolstered by a new addition on the touchline. Northwestern added Jennie Clark a defensive-minded coach to the staff this offseason affirming a commitment to a strong defense. Clark’s experience in professional soccer will assist the ‘Cats as they seek to improve upon last season’s already impressive defensive showing. There will be a new face in net for the Wildcats this season with sophomore Reiley Fitzpatrick receiving the first start of the season; however it is still an open competition between her and graduate transfer Gina Muzi. Regardless of who is between the sticks it will be their duty to command the defense Use set pieces effectively The set piece when executed correctly can lead to some of the most beautiful goals in soccer. Northwestern fans are familiar with set piece success especially from Phillips. The center back has already scored on a corner this season and she is always a threat to score within the eighteen. Effective set pieces will also help fulfill the goal of getting multiple players involved as anyone can be a threat on a well-placed ball. Corner and free kicks can lead to easy goals; Northwestern just needs to take advantage.  Lay the foundation for lasting success Northwestern proved last season that it can compete in the current Big Ten but the conference is about to get a lot harder thanks to the West Coast invasion. While this season is about repeating that success it is also about gearing up for 2024 and beyond. This will take a team effort especially on the part of the upperclassmen. Those who have been in the program for a while will need to mentor the younger and newer players instilling within them the work ethic and resolve required to build a lasting elite program. Now that the Wildcats have had a taste of consistent top-25 rankings they won’t want to return to mediocrity. Establishing a strong program culture this year will allow Northwestern to remain amongst the blue bloods and become a prominent name for years to come.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After nine months without it Northwestern women’s soccer is finally back. We’ve had quite a bit of preseason coverage the past few weeks here at Inside NU but now it’s time to talk about the real thing. To the pitch! Aug. 17 at Marquette The ‘Cats were getting tired of dawdling and twiddling their thumbs. They wanted to play soccer dang it! Their opportunity finally came Aug. 17 when the Golden Eagles screeched out “Play us!” Marquette would soon come to regret that challenge as Northwestern had its way with its northern neighbors. Eager might be the best description for Northwestern’s play. Ella Hase wasted no time putting the ‘Cats on the board 39 seconds in scoring the second-fastest goal in program history. First-year Holland Carey earned a hockey assist on the play with the first touch of her career while Meg Boade took on the keeper and put through the final ball to find Hase for a sitter. ""First touch of Holland Careys career finds @megboade who slots it through to Ella Hase for the opener.   pic.twitter.com/0PUBzbKuPk"" Three minutes later Boade decided that she needed a goal of her own. When the ball fell to her at the top of the 18 she seized her opportunity rifling one past the keeper into the top right corner. .@meg_boade with a BANGER   pic.twitter.com/4SP0kArLTu A 2-0 lead is nothing to scoff at but why not keep going? Josie Aulicino had that same thought in the fifteenth minute. Lining up at the corner flag Aulicino floated one to the back post. None other than Emma Phillips was there to receive it and she buried a header for what could be the first of many set-piece goals this season. Set. Piece. Magic. @emmanphillips_ pic.twitter.com/mqEg9XSEfb After three goals in the first fifteen minutes the Wildcats continued attacking placing six shots in the final 30 minutes of the first half. None found the back of the net but Northwestern remained on the front foot regardless. It was Aulicino who wanted to score next. She took three shots to start the second half to no avail but her fourth try was the charm. A pass from Hase found Aulicino about 20 yards from the goal which No. 8 absolutely lasered past the goalie. A 4-0 lead 77 minutes in was more than enough and the ‘Cats left Milwaukee 1-0-0. Northwestern out-shot Marquette 19-7 with the Wildcat goalie tandem of Reiley Fitzpatrick and Gina Muzi handling all four of the Golden Eagles’ shots on target. Aug. 20 vs Kansas State After a strong start an hour and a half north Northwestern returned to the lakeside for its home opener. The Wildcats’ opponent? The Wildcats. Kansas State made the trip up to Evanston to see what being a purple feline was all about. While Northwestern was surely able to prove its superiority in all other facets the ‘Cats were unable to do so on the pitch. An early season tie is not the end of the world but it stings to know that a win was attainable. Northwestern attacked early and often taking seven shots in the first 15 minutes. The ‘Cats entered halftime with a 12-0 shot advantage but nothing to show for it on the board. They kept looking for that breakthrough goal but it never came despite a 19-3 shot advantage. Breaking through tough opposing defenses will need to be something Michael Moynihan’s squad needs to figure out going forward. If opposing teams realize that they can just park the bus this season will get boring fast. Does it really count as an undefeated season if you tie every game? (My JV soccer team in high school would say yes – undefeated in 2019 with only one win). For now have faith that this team can and will score but finding that final ball will only become more difficult once Big Ten play begins. One bright spot for the ‘Cats despite the disappointing result was the discipline.  Northwestern only had two fouls to KState’s 14 avoiding any yellow cards for the second game in a row. Committing fewer fouls than the opponent usually works out so it’s a positive sign early. Moving Forward Summertime Chi is a tough place to leave so the ‘Cats (1-0-1) will remain at home for their next contest. Their opponent might take time to visit Wrigley as they’re reeling from the loss of their local MLB team– *Scratch that. I am hearing that Oakland University is NOT in California. Please disregard the previous comment*– Their opponents will be making their way down from Michigan for the second half of a home-and-home that began last season. This matchup ended in a 0-0 tie last year so the ‘Cats will be hungry to take down the Golden Grizzlies (1-1-0). The match is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. CT on Aug. 24. The ‘Cats aren’t able to stay by the better lake forever though. They’ll be heading to Toledo to end the week trading Lake Michigan for the inferior Lake Erie. The Rockets aren’t the most formidable opponent on paper going 2-10-6 last season but Northwestern needs to be sure not to overlook them. The ‘Cats will see if they can take care of business on Aug. 27 at 12:00 p.m. CT. As Northwestern continues on this season be on the lookout for lineup adjustments. In the first two games only one new player featured in the starting XI for the ‘Cats. These next few weeks before Big Ten play will be an opportunity to let the first-years and newcomers on the pitch show what they can do.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story The Basics Returning Production: 64% overall (64% offense 63% defense) 65th overall 2022 Record: 8-5 (4-5 B1G won Duke’s Mayo Bowl) Head Coach: Mike Locksley (5th season) The Stats 2023 SP+ Overall: 41st 2023 SP+ Offense: 44th 2023 SP+ Defense: 30th 2022 Capsule Maryland finished with an 8-5 record last season its best since Mike Locksley took over as head coach in 2019. It’s clear that the Terps are starting to reap the rewards of the Washington D.C. native’s recruiting prowess. The program had five players drafted in the 2022 NFL draft and while that isn’t a foolproof indicator of success (Northwestern had four) it does prove that Maryland is starting to accumulate impact talent. The Terps started 2022 with three straight non-conference victories against Buffalo Charlotte and SMU. Their first loss of the season came in their first conference game against Michigan which was ranked fourth in the nation at the time. Maryland gave Jim Harbaugh’s Wolverines a fight in the early-season matchup falling by just one touchdown in a 34-27 game. The team was competitive despite an inconsistent performance from starting quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa in which he threw two picks and just one TD pass. Tagovailoa would bounce back the following weekend against Michigan State posting a 150.4 quarterback rating and beating the Spartans 27-13. Running back Antwaine Littleton also had 120 yards on the ground with a score. Littleton is part of a formidable backfield along with leading rusher Roman Hemby who posted 989 yards and 10 touchdowns in 2022. Both players will return to the running back room in 2023 as will former four-star Ramon Brown. Maryland fell to 4-2 the next week losing a nail-biter at home against Purdue 31-29. The Terps then rattled off two straight wins against Indiana and Northwestern but both contests were decided by one score or less. That’s probably closer than what Locksley and his staff had hoped for against bottom feeders in the Big Ten.  At 6-2 Maryland hit a brutal stretch in its schedule in which it played Wisconsin Penn State and Ohio State back to back to back. It lost all three in pretty brutal fashion — the worst of which being a 30-0 trouncing at the hands of the Nittany Lions.  But the Terps bounced back to close out the year blowing out Rutgers 37-0 and winning the Duke’s Mayo Bowl against NC State 16-12. Tagovailoa ended his campaign with 3008 yards passing and an 18/8 touchdown to interception ratio. Despite dealing with some nagging injuries the familiar name played in 12 of 13 games and enters his senior season as the Terrapin’s most important piece as they continue to try to compete with the big dogs in the Big Ten East. Offensive Overview This offense will be under the direction of two new “co-OCs” in Kevin Sumlin and Josh Gattis after the unit took somewhat of a step backwards in 2022 resulting in the firing of Dan Enos. But while the coaching turnover is significant it all starts with Tagovailoa. The rising senior was reportedly offered significant NIL money to transfer into the SEC but decided to stay loyal and spend another season in College Park. It’s a good sign for the Terps that he seems committed to improving the program but he should also be personally motivated to improve his NFL draft stock. Right now Tagovailoa is probably a mid-round draft pick. A really impressive 2023 however could change things. In the receiver room the Terps will be somewhat reliant on incoming transfers to produce. Kaden Prather is coming over from West Virginia after posting 501 yards for the Mountaineers and Tyrese Chambers is coming back to his home state of Maryland after a 544-yard junior season at FIU. Tagovailoa will also have returning wide-out talent in the form of last year’s leading receiver Jeshaun Jones and talented junior Corey Dyches. Factoring in the three-headed rushing attack of Hemby Littleton and Brown the weapons are solid. The line however is a bit more of a concern. Reworked through the transfer portal the unit features just one returning starter in tackle Delmar Glaze. A three-star out of high school Glaze is outperforming expectations posting the fourth-best pass block grade in the Big Ten according to PFF in 2022. He seems primed to break out even more for the Terps in 2023. The rest of the line is made up largely of transfer acquisitions including Marcus Dumervil from LSU and Gottlieb Ayedze from Frostburg State. If the unit gels nicely then the talent is there to provide good protection for Tagovailoa. If not then the senior might be on the run more than Locksley and the Terps are hoping. Defensive Overview The defense has been a work in progress under Locksley. It was a middling unit in 2022 giving up the seventh most points per game in the Big Ten at 23.2 and benefiting from shutting out Rutgers. That’s a real improvement for Maryland which has been looking for consistency on defense for a while. It’s still not quite where the Terps would like to be but they’ll look to take even more steps in the upcoming season. Brian Williams was at least somewhat responsible for the improved defense in 2022 and he’ll return for his second season as defensive coordinator. Frankly the expectation seems to be that this unit is capable of turning in a fairly similar result to last year but a massive improvement is unlikely.  The pass rush might be better. Maryland was ninth in the Big Ten in sacks last year but it added talent in the portal. Edge rusher Donnell Brown is in College Park after spending three seasons at St. Francis and winning the Northeast Conference Defensive Player of the Year award in 2022. Jordan Phillips is also joining the interior line after a season at Tennessee in which he barely saw any action — but his talent and power are real. In the secondary the Terps lost some players but the starting safeties are both familiar faces. Returning senior Beau Brade last season’s leading tackler will line up alongside Dante Trader Jr. who had two picks last year as a sophomore. Corey Coley Jr. will likely get starting reps at corner opposite incoming transfer Ja’Quan Sheppard. There may be less experience than last year but the secondary might also be a little more athletic. It could balance out nicely especially if pass rushers are causing problems for opposing QBs. Three players to know DT Tommy Akingbesote Philips will be a factor on the interior defensive line and so will returner Tommy Akingbesote. He played in nine games in 2022 but was really improving as the season went on. This year as a junior he’ll look to take the next step.  A four-star recruit coming out of high school Akingbesote is a local guy from Upper Marlboro MD. At 6’4” he starred as a basketball player in high school before transitioning to football as he grew into his body. He had 14 tackles and two sacks in 2022 but was behind Mosiah Nasili-Kite on the depth chart. This year he’ll have the opportunity to start games for the Terps. According to his 247sports page he needed some development out of high school in terms of diagnosing blocks and understanding how to channel his athleticism. Well now he’s three years into a career at Maryland and it feels like it’s coming along. Watch out for Akingbesote this year on the line of scrimmage. Roman Hemby Hemby is impossible to not put on this list. The Terps are pretty stacked at the running back position but it doesn’t really matter unless Hemby gets hurt. He’s the clearcut number one guy for this offense and his production was fantastic in 2022 finishing with the seventh most rushing yards in the Big Ten. Hemby will look to take the jump into the upper echelon of Big Ten rushers hoping to crack the 1000 yard mark and continue to punch the ball into the end zone for Maryland at a high clip. He was also a factor in the receiving game posting 298 yards and 333 receptions last year. He has the skillset to improve those numbers as well. Should Hemby blossom into a superstar this year significant pressure will be lifted from the shoulders of Tagovailoa. He could really use a bell cow back to anchor the rushing attack and help move the Terrapins up the field. Jaishawn Barham Barham was also a four-star out of high school ranked 130th in the class of 2022 per 247sports. He had 35 tackles and four sacks in his freshman season and will start his sophomore year at the always-important middle linebacker spot. He also played outside linebacker throughout high school so he has positional flexibility that the Terps could take advantage of if the situation presented itself. Barham is a solid tackler who showed good instincts in his first season. He’s a great athlete and his 6’3” 230-pound frame is solid for a linebacker. He was an honorable mention for an All-Big Ten selection last year and opens this season named to the preseason watch list for the Chuck Bednarik Award which is given to the best defensive player in college football. Barham appears to be the real deal for the Terps and his sophomore season will be telling. He’s already shown he can start in the Big Ten and we know he’s an athletic monster with a confident understanding of his position. But with experience comes maturity especially at linebacker. With 2022 under his belt Barham should be able to develop into a leader and captain the defense from his middle linebacker spot. The sky’s the limit for him. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Hawkeyes’ offense was not any better the next week although the team did score its first touchdown of the season. Iowa’s offensive output ended there allowing the Cyclones to pull out a 10-7 win. The Hawkeyes blanked Nevada 27-0 to close out non-conference play and defeated Rutgers 27-10 — aided by two defensive scores — to pick up their first Big Ten win of the season. Despite starting conference play strong Iowa found itself in a hole midway through the year. In their second conference matchup of the season the Hawkeyes fell short of completing a fourth-quarter comeback against Michigan losing 27-14. Iowa did not get on the scoreboard until the final frame. The following week the Hawkeyes were in a battle of defensive titans going up against the Fighting Illini. In a hard-nosed showdown Iowa’s offense continued to flounder and the Hawkeyes fell short 9-6.  As if it could get worse for Iowa it would have to keep up with the high-octane offense of Ohio State the next week. Spoiler it didn’t. The Hawkeyes were boat-raced by the Buckeyes 54-10 and fell to a dismal 3-4 record dropping to 1-3 in Big Ten play. The Hawkeyes got back on track dismantling Northwestern 33-13. For an offense that had been unwatchable all year Iowa imposed its will on the Wildcats tallying a total of nearly 400 yards. The win over the ‘Cats sprung the Hawkeyes to a hot streak. Iowa picked up another easy win the next week beating Purdue 24-3. The Hawkeyes knocked off Wisconsin 24-10 and Minnesota 13-10 for their fourth straight win. In their final game the Hawkeyes lined up against Nebraska. The Huskers jumped out to a 24-0 lead and by the time Iowa found the end zone midway through the third period the deficit was too much to overcome. The Hawkeyes lost 24-17 finishing the regular season 7-5 — good enough to be sent to the TransPerfect Music City Bowl. In the Music City Bowl the Hawkeyes’ offense sputtered against Kentucky after scoring the first points of the game; however two Iowa pick-sixes put the game out of reach and the team went on to win 21-0 taking home the bowl trophy in the process. Offensive Overview ""How bad is your offense when the coordinator has a points incentive in his contract? Well if you’re Iowa it means its horrendous. The Hawkeyes were at the bottom of every major statistical category under Brian Ferentz including landing in the bottom 10 in scoring offense and being second-to-worst in total offense across all 131 FBS teams. If it wasn’t for its admirable defense which at times scored more than the offense Iowa would have faced a similar fate as Northwestern did in 2022. Quarterback Spencer Petras was uninspiring all season with the exception being against Jim O’Neil. He threw for only 1725 yards and five touchdowns in 12 games."" In hopes of turning things around the Hawkeyes brought in Michigan transfer Cade McNamara to guide the offense in 2023. McNamara tore his ACL in 2022 ending his season early but he led the Wolverines to their first appearance in the College Football Playoff. In his lone season as the starter in Ann Arbor McNamara passed for 2576 yards and 15 touchdowns while only tossing six interceptions. McNamara will have a big target to look for in tight end Luke Lachey who was second on the team in receiving yards last season. With Erick All following his quarterback from Ann Arbor to Iowa City the Hawkeyes’ offense will rely heavily on their tight ends to make plays in the passing game. Defensive Overview Let’s be frank: the only reason Iowa was competitive last season was because of its defense. Unlike the offense the Hawkeyes’ defense consistently ranked in the top 10 in many statistical categories. Iowa finished second in total defense the exact opposite of its offensive counterpart and second in points allowed across the entire nation. As Iowa’s defense prevented the opponent from scoring it also found itself scoring often. The Hawkeyes scored 61 points off turnovers last year including multiple games in which they notched two or more defensive scores. ""The Hawkeyes defense had two players selected in the first round of the NFL Draft but they still have a plethora of talent returning for the 2023 season. Led by defensive back Cooper DeJean who had five interceptions eight pass breakups and 75 tackles in 2022 Iowa’s back end will still be one of the best in the nation this upcoming season. The Hawkeyes will take the ball away from opponents — whether their offense can capitalize is still up for discussion."" Three Players to Watch QB Cade McNamara The main reason for Iowa’s offensive struggles last season was its quarterback play. Both Spencer Petras and Alex Padilla were abysmal last year holding the Hawkeyes back from reaching their potential.  Enter McNamara. The former Wolverine is expected to be the missing piece of Brian Ferentz’s offense and get Iowa over the hump. McNamara was solid in his one season at the helm of Michigan’s offense posting a 77.4 PFF offensive grade in 2021. His 2576 passing yards would have put him in the top 15 for a single season in Iowa history. McNamara will attack downfield unleashing nearly 50 passes of 20+ yards. With No. 12 at the helm expect the Hawkeyes to open up the playbook and attack the field vertically. DL Deontae Craig The Hawkeyes had two members of their front seven come off the board in the first round yet Craig may have been the best player on Iowa’s feared pass rush. Craig led Iowa with 10 tackles for losses and was tied for the most sacks with 6.5. At 6-foot-3 Craig uses his length to create separation and bend to beat tackles off the edge. Despite being listed as a second-teamer to start 2022 Craig was one of the most impactful players for the Hawkeyes last season. Now as a first-teamer Craig is expected to be the premiere edge rusher for Iowa terrorizing Big Ten quarterbacks for the entirety of 2023. P Tory Taylor You cannot talk about Iowa without mentioning its best player: punter Tory Taylor. Taylor has a rocket attached to his leg averaging 45 yards a punt. He dropped 38 punts inside the 20 last season allowing the Hawkeyes’ defense to pin offenses deep and flip the field. There’s a reason Taylor was a second-team All-American in 2022 — because he was as dominant as any specialist in the nation. Now is this my special teams bias talking right now? Absolutely. However I find it extremely easy to believe that Iowa would have lost more games last season if it did not have a stud of a punter.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story This past season Northwestern baseball found itself in a position it never should have been. And that’s not even talking about how the Wildcats were on their third coach in three consecutive seasons their 10-40 record after opening the season with 12 straight losses or the fact that the team hasn’t actually had a winning record since 2000. None of that is good but what was avoidable what probably never should have happened was the hiring of Jim Foster. Foster’s hiring led to a transfer exodus and questions of whether Northwestern can field a team this upcoming season.  Yet despite the program hitting an all-time low the hiring of Ben Greenspan as the new head coach may have just restored some hope. For the first time in a long time there are thoughts of a Northwestern baseball future that instead of referencing its demise are about players thriving within the program because of Greenspan at the helm.  Saying Northwestern made a formidable hire is perhaps giving the university too much credit. It shouldn’t be too much of a stretch to realize that a head coaching hire shouldn’t be left to two boosters; regardless Northwestern got that right the second time around hiring global talent advisory firm DHR to lead the search.  Greenspan comes to Evanston with a pretty admirable resume that spotlights his eye for recruiting. Last season he was the Associate Head Coach and Recruiting Coordinator for Michigan where he brought in a 31st-ranked recruiting class by Perfect Game — the previous year the Wolverines’ class was 85th. In 2022 he was at Cal Poly where he coached MLB Pipeline’s No. 18 overall prospect and first-round pick Brooks Lee and Yankees fifth-round pick Drew Thrope. As said Greenspan can recruit and these past two seasons just barely grasp the depth of his talent.  He spent seven seasons at top-tier Arizona State serving as Associate Head Coach for the last four and being part of four NCAA regional berths. At ASU Greenspan headlined five top-10 recruiting classes over just six years and had 33 players get recruited including Spencer Torkelson the first overall pick in the 2020 draft Gavin Lux and Bo Bichette.  He also spent six seasons at Indiana unsurprisingly being named recruiting coordinator in his last. Here he was part of three NCAA tournament appearances a College World Series appearance and the recruitment of players like No. 4 overall pick and two-time All-Star Kyle Schwarber.  On paper Greenspan is a desirable proven coach. However endorsements from Schwarber Torkelson Michigan Head Coach Tracy Smith and none other than Vanderbilt Head Coach Tim Corbin are affirmations that mean a whole more than any record could show. These endorsements display his ability and tenacity — exactly what Northwestern needs.  After Foster’s firing it was thought that assistant coach Brian Anderson would “take leadership of the program.” He received strong support from the players but the school needed to bring in an outsider who was also beyond established as a leader. The program needs to erase all memory of last year’s toxic and abusive culture and given how depleted the roster now is it needed someone who knows how to recruit and build. The future of Wildcat baseball has been an ominous topic in recent years. The program hasn’t been proven to win and it hasn’t been proven to keep players — see losses of key contributors in 2022 in Anthony Calarco Ethan O’Donnell and Sean Sullivan and 15 players after 2023. With each hiring it’s been about who is capable of turning this program around and now on its fourth coach in four years that’s up to Greenspan. With Greenspan the ‘Cats are led by someone who has successfully recruited and coached not just drafted players but players who have undoubtedly made it in the MLB; someone who is known for recruiting at each program he was with; someone who knows how to win.  Part of Greenspan’s statement read: “This program will be built around the student-athletes. My job is to identify recruit and develop young men to reach their highest potential individually and collectively as a team.” Sounds standard sounds cliché but at the same time Greenspan’s entire coaching career points to doing just that. There are many seasons in the making before Northwestern will be where it wants to be and Greenspan has players and staff to win over. But for the first time in a long time it’s worth believing in the future of Northwestern baseball.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Each day we are getting closer to Northwestern Wildcats football and this comes with evaluating the ‘Cats opponents this season. Next up is the “new and improved” Wisconsin Badgers. The Basics Returning Production: 72% overall (75% offense 68% defense) 2022 Record: 7-6 (4-5 B1G) Head Coach: Luke Fickell (1st season) The Stats 2023 SP+ Overall: 19th 2023 SP+ Offense: 41st 2023 SP+ Defense: 7th 2022 Capsule After putting on a defensive clinic in their opening matchup against Illinois State Wisconsin laid an egg in their first real matchup of the 2022 season losing to Washington State in Madison.  After rebounding against inferior New Mexico State the Badgers got battered by Ohio State and Illinois; a defense that was one of the best in the country gave up 86 points in two games. Following its loss to the Fighting Illini Wisconsin relieved head coach Paul Chryst of his duties and named Defensive Coordinator Jim Leonhard as interim head coach for the remainder of the 2022 campaign. Though the Badgers responded to some extent the rest of the season was filled with ups and downs. They were able to beat Purdue and Maryland two high-scoring offenses but lost Paul Bunyan’s axe to Minnesota. Wisconsin finished the regular season with a record of 7-6 and 4-5 in the Big Ten.  The major problem with this team was that quarterback Graham Mertz was never able to turn into the quarterback many thought he could be especially after he threw five touchdowns in 2020 in his collegiate debut. Prior to facing off against Oklahoma State in the Guaranteed Rate Bowl Luke Fickell was hired as the next head coach in Madison. In the final game of the 2022 season Braelon Allen who was the Badgers’ marquee player all season ran for 116 yards and a touchdown to beat the Cowboys. Moreover Wisconsin’s defense was able to stop Oklahoma State all game as OSU did not score over double digits until the fourth quarter but the game was already out of reach. To put it all in one graph: the Badgers had high expectations and never reached them. They want changes and so they made it. The bowl game was a glimpse of what Wisconsin CAN be in 2023. Offensive Overview It was pretty clear that quarterback was the problem for Wisconsin in 2022. Graham Mertz had another below-average season throwing for 2136 yards and 19 touchdowns along with 10 interceptions. As a team the Badgers scored 26.31 points per game going along with 363.6 yards per game. Though they were ranked in the upper half of the Big Ten in total offense their numbers were no match for the conference’s marquee offenses such as Ohio State and Michigan. Rushing is a slightly different story: Braelon Allen is not only one of the top running backs in the conference but the country. In a conference that featured many marquee backs — Blake Corum Donovan Edwards Nick Singleton Chase Brown Evan Hull and Mo Ibrahim — Allen might have been one of the best rushing for 1242 yards. It was the second straight 1200+ yard season for the junior.  Yet again the Big Ten will have big-name running backs and Allen will be at the top of the list. Wisconsin should have one of the top offensive lines in the conference and maybe the country as well. However the biggest change for the Badgers came with the staff and quarterback. It starts with Luke Fickell who comes over to Madison after six years at Cincinnati. Fickell turned the Bearcats into a better program posting a 57-18 record over his time there including a College Football Playoff appearance. This changes Wisconsin from the jump. Moreover the Badgers brought in Phil Longo to be their offensive coordinator. Longo formerly at North Carolina coached some of the top college football quarterbacks in Sam Howell and Drake Maye during his time in Chapel Hill and he brings his extensive resume to the Badgers. Now let’s talk about Wisconsin’s starting quarterback Tanner Mordecai. Mordecai comes over from SMU after throwing for 3524 yards 33 touchdowns and posting a 151.9 passing rating last season. He will be at the center of the offense and hopes he can lead a high-scoring group in a Big Ten full of them. If Mordecai can click with Fickell and Longo’s offensive scheme and Braelon Allen is Braelon Allen sheesh. Watch out for the Badgers. Defensive Overview In 2021 Wisconsin had one of the best defenses in the nation falling just short of top-ranked Georgia.  In 2022 this unit took a step back ranking sixth in the Big Ten in yards per game. The highlight was their rushing defense which was third in the conference — behind Michigan and Illinois — allowing just over 100 yards per game. In ESPN’s rankings of the best college football defenses ahead of the season Wisconsin ranked 10th. Key returners include linebackers Maema Njongmeta and Jordan Turner the two leading tacklers last season. Furthermore Fickell was able to bring in transfers on the defensive side of the ball such as CB Jason Maitre DL Darian Varner DE Jeff Pietrowski and CB Nyzier Fourqurean. The defense will be a mix of some old and new concepts; however Wisconsin’s defense should be better than last year. Three Players to Watch QB Tanner Mordecai As mentioned quarterback has been the problem of the Wisconsin offense for the past few years but Mordecai can change that from day one. With his arm talent mobility and ability to see the field he is already the best quarterback the Badgers have had in a while; however the key here is whether he will fit into Fickell and Longo’s Cincinnati/UNC style offense. Mordecai has the chance to be one of the best quarterbacks in the Big Ten with a talented skill position group around him and a strong offensive line. Don’t be surprised if he becomes a big name early on. LB Maema Njongmeta Njongmeta was Wisconsin’s leading tackler last season and if this defense wants to take a leap from a poor season for Wisconsin standards it starts with him. He will be the captain of the defense and is capable in both the rush and pass. WRs Chimere Dike and C.J. Williams It’s hard to pick just one of the two but the Wisconsin receivers have not gotten enough attention. Dike is going into his fourth year and should start as the Badgers’ top wideout in 2023 racking in 689 yards and six touchdowns last season. With Mordecai at the helm these numbers should rise. Williams is the key here: he was a highlight at spring practice after transferring from Southern Cal making leaping catches over defenders day in and out. He provides natural talent on the outside. He can be a main feature in this wide receiver corps that should be better than last year. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Over the past week Inside NU’s team has looked at each of Northwestern football’s upcoming 2023 opponents. Nearing the end of Northwestern’s Big Ten schedule let’s take a dive into NU’s second-to-last opponent in 2023: the reigning Big Ten West Division champion Purdue Boilermakers. The Basics Returning Production: 51% overall (50% offense 52% defense); 109th Record: 8-6 (6-3 B1G lost in the Big Ten Championship Game and the 2023 Cheez-It Citrus Bowl) Head Coach: Ryan Walters (1st season) The Stats The following metrics are courtesy of Bill Connelly and ESPN. You can read more about the rankings and theory behind them here. 2023 SP+ Overall: 58th 2023 SP+ Offense: 53rd 2023 SP+ Defense: 55th 2022 Capsule Ending 2021 feeling good after a heart-pounding 48-45 victory in the Music City Bowl over Tennessee Purdue had high expectations for 2022. However a Penn State touchdown with just under a minute remaining in the Boilermakers’ season opener at home handed Purdue its first loss of the season. And even after a 56-0 thumping of Indiana State in its second game Purdue surrendered a touchdown with seven seconds left on the road against Syracuse moving to 1-2 early in the 2022 campaign. Yet thanks to a flurry of defensive stops in crunch time against FAU the next week the Boilermakers not only came away with a 28-26 victory but picked up steam heading into the thick of conference play. Against the No. 21 Minnesota Golden Gophers Purdue’s defense led the way intercepting three passes on the way to the Boilermakers’ first victory in Minneapolis since 2007. A week later Purdue’s defense came up big again allowing its offense to compile back-to-back fourth quarter touchdown drives lifting the Boilermakers to a 31-29 victory over Maryland. And against Nebraska at home the offense exploded with QB Aidan O’Connell throwing for four scores and RB Devin Mockobee racking up 178 yards leading Purdue to another one-possession victory over Big Ten Competition. But the next two weeks weren’t so kind to the 5-2 Boilermakers. Although Mockobee and WR Charlie Jones combined for over 200 scrimmage yards against Wisconsin O’Connell’s three interceptions were too much to overcome in the 35-24 loss. And against one of the strongest defenses in the country Purdue’s capable offense was stymied to only three points versus Iowa. Sitting at 5-4 Purdue responded with three convincing wins against No. 21 Illinois Northwestern and Indiana securing a bowl appearance as well as the program’s first ever Big Ten West Division title and trip to the Big Ten Football Championship Game. But a date with No. 2 Michigan in Indianapolis for the Big Ten’s crown was too much for the Boilermakers who after a close first half were unable to find the second half juice to stay with the Wolverines. And without a couple crucial cogs playing on both sides of the football in the 2023 Cheez-It Citrus Bowl Purdue ended its campaign with a 63-7 loss to No. 17 LSU. Offensive Overview Last season Purdue’s offense ranked fifth in the Big Ten in total offense per game second in passing yards per game and 11th in rushing yards per game. Yet without last year’s head coach Jeff Brohm — who’ll coach at his alma mater Louisville in 2023 — and starting quarterback in O’Connell — who after throwing for 3490 yards 22 touchdowns and 13 interceptions in 2022 got drafted by the Las Vegas Raiders — Purdue has big shoes to fill in 2023. The Boilermakers also lost their top two receiving threats in Jones a Cincinnati Bengals draft pick who hauled in 110 catches for 1361 yards and 12 touchdowns and TE Payne Durham who after racking up 101 catches for 1027 yards and 14 touchdowns the past two seasons was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Luckily for the Boilermakers the pieces are in place to find offensive success under new offensive coordinator Graham Harrell. Harrell whose offense at West Virginia last season posted nearly 400 yards and 30.6 points per game ran a balanced attack something that should translate well to Purdue’s personnel with a solid ground game headlined by Mockobee and a capable passing game thanks to Texas transfer Hudson Card. Although the Boilermakers lost Jones and Durham in the offseason they return TJ Sheffield who caught 46 balls for 480 yards and four touchdowns in 2022 and Mershawn Rice who added 23 catches for 283 yards and a touchdown a season ago. Plus 6-foot-3 transfer Jahmal Edrine reeled in 39 catches for 570 yards and six scores for Florida Atlantic last season production that should translate to red zone success for Card through the air. Defensive Overview With new head coach Ryan Walters Illinois’ defensive coordinator from a season ago taking over defense will be a focus in West Lafayette. Under Walters the Fighting Illini led the country in points per game allowed while also finishing second in yards per game allowed. Running a 3-4 scheme Purdue’s outside linebackers are a group to watch. Particularly Kydran Jenkins the senior who’s racked up nine sacks in his last two seasons should be a threat off the edge. Additionally sophomore Nic Scourton has become a name to watch for the Boilermakers after tallying two sacks in 2022 and showcasing his pass-rushing skills in the spring. To beef up the front three Purdue added Malik Langham Isaiah Nichols and Jeffrey M’Ba in the transfer portal alongside corners Salim Turner-Muhammad and Marquis Wilson from Stamford and Penn State to help replace Cory Trice’s departure by way of the NFL Draft. Add in the fact that both of Purdue’s starting safeties — and two of its most talented players — in Sanoussi Kane and Cam Allen are returning and the defense should be just fine in Walters’ first season in charge. Three Players to Watch QB Hudson Card With O’Connell leaving for the NFL Draft in the offseason Purdue dipped into the transfer portal grabbing one of the best options available in the former Texas gunslinger. In five starts over 22 games in his last three seasons in Austin the former four-star recruit posted 1523 passing yards 11 touchdowns and two interceptions on 65.5% accuracy. But more importantly with Texas starter Quinn Ewers going down with injury last season Card stepped up and showed he’s got everything it takes to be a successful starter. With his mix of arm strength and touch from the pocket Card has the chance to be Purdue’s best quarterback since Drew Brees and that means a lot for a program that has seen guys like Kyle Orton Curtis Painter and David Blough come through West Lafayette and start in the NFL. But Card has all the tools: he’s got pocket presence and escapability from pressure the ability to expand the field with his big arm the accuracy to find receivers at any level while being able to scamper the ball forward with his legs. After losing a lot of talent in the offseason Purdue remains competitive in 2023 thanks to Card under center. RB Devin Mockobee The former walk-on was an all around weapon for the Boilermakers last year finishing the season with 968 rushing yards and nine rushing touchdowns alongside 32 catches for 274 yards. And as Purdue’s best returner on offense expect nothing to change in 2023. Listed at 6-foot Mockobee possesses excellent speed whether in the short passing game or as a runner. His ability to break things to the outside stretches defenses but complimented with a mix of toughness and burst Mockobee is effective running in between the tackles in short yardage situations. Elusive in the open field Mockobee’s vision makes him dangerous in open space. Willing to cut away from defenders at a moment’s notice look for the Boilermakers to lean on their bell cow in 2023. DB Cam Allen An honorable mention all-Big Ten selection a season ago Allen has been a huge component to Purdue’s defense in his time in West Lafayette. The Virginia native has 10 interceptions 12 pass deflections four fumble recoveries and 173 total tackles to his name through four seasons and is looking to keep the mojo going in 2023.  With his athleticism and ball-hawking abilities Walters will rely on Allen’s experience and playmaking in the back end of his defense. A true leader for this Purdue squad Allen has NFL talent and is another good campaign away from showing scouts he’s got a legitimate future at the next level. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story With only 10 days remaining until Northwestern football kicks off its 2023 season the Wildcats hosted their third and final media availability on Wednesday following a closed practice. Here’s all of what interim head coach David Braun running back Cam Porter wide receiver Cam Johnson and defensive lineman Sean McLaughlin had to say. Interim head coach David Braun Opening statement: “The heat was good for us today. We certainly needed it as we’re preparing for Sept. 3. Really excited about where this team is at right now. Certainly still have a long way to go but you can tell that this group is really starting to enjoy finding a rhythm and a routine. We just completed what should have felt like a Tuesday of a week we prep. We’ll go into our Wednesday routine tomorrow Thursday routine on Friday. Really just get into a progression moving forward. “Excited about an opportunity for a mock game for our team over at Ryan Field this Saturday — another opportunity to get out on that natural surface and get into a rhythm routine for a coaching staff with a lot of guys on it that this was the first time that they’re embarking on a season at Northwestern. It’ll be a great opportunity for me to get into that rhythm and routine when we return home on Sept. 9. “Certainly a long way to go for this football team still but excited to be in rhythm and routine. Excited to be focused on Rutgers and truly believe that we got a locker room that is poised to have a have a great start to the season.” On if he’s decided on a starting quarterback: “We’ve had talks internally and we’re really excited about the competition in that room and the depth in that room. But some of those decisions that we’ve made we’re we’re choosing to keep keeping in-house at this time.” Elaborating on the quarterback competition: “There’s multiple guys that are still getting a ton of reps. Ben Bryant’s taking a significant amount of reps. Brendan Sullivan’s taking a significant amount of reps. We’re going to find ways to involve Jack Lausch in a lot of different ways with our football team. As we look at the entire roster you look at Jack and you go ‘How can we not consider this guy one of our top athletes one of our top football players?’ We’ve got to find a way to get him involved. “I’ll speak to Ryan Hilinski as well. Ryan is doing an incredible job. Right now in terms of the majority of the reps Ben Bryant and Brendan Sullivan are taking majority of those reps at the quarterback position. Excited about the depth in that room right now.” On if he’ll pivot from a starting quarterback in-game: “That’ll be a conversation that Coach Bajakian and I continue to work through. This team does need a starting quarterback. They need one individual; that’s our starter. If there’s other ways to utilize our skillsets within that room then let’s tap into that. But we need someone that’s our starting quarterback. Entire locker room’s behind that individual and we’re ready to embark on an entire season with that guy as our starter.” On how he views the nature of the competition: “It’s a great problem to have. If people want to speculate or there’s information that starts to get out there about what the anticipated starter is those are things that you can’t always perfectly control. But at the same time as coaches we’re in a business of collecting information. Right now I don’t feel like it’s necessarily my job to come out and openly broadcast what our exact plan is at that position.” On determining captains and the recipient of the No. 1 jersey: “We will name captains; we’ll be doing that very soon. Something that’s been really important to our leadership and myself is just this team the way that they’ve galvanized the way that they’ve embarked on the month of July and the month of August. Intentionally we’ve taken some time to work through that process and really see not just who’s leading on Day One or Day Four but who’s leading as we go through the dog days of camp. I know that there’s gonna be a lot of young men on this roster that gets significant amount of votes. The leadership on this team is strong.” On recent statements from former Northwestern student-athletes that have been released: “Our former football players here have been incredible with their attendance at practice reaching out to our players and just showing unwavering support for young men that are going through what they went through — what it feels like to be a student-athlete at Northwestern. It takes takes a special person to embark on that. The requirements from an education standpoint playing Big Ten football the quarter system. I mean there’s such a unique experience. It’s been really neat for me since I got here in January to get to know a lot of the alumni and share with them what their experiences have been. We’re doing everything in our power to make sure that the experiences this group of young men has is very similar to to what they had. “In terms of some of the things out there in regards to statements I’ll tell you exactly what I told our team today after practice. That stuff is in the rearview. I mean we’re on to Rutgers. We’re looking through the windshield; it’s time for us to look straight ahead. That road right now points to points to New Jersey and that’s where our focus is at right now.” On if alumni have spoken to the team: “I’ll keep those conversations private. What I will say is our staff has been very intentional about making sure that our football team feels supported by that group. It’s one thing through words and text but our alumni’s presence at practice is something that we’ve really really appreciated. We need their presence at games; we need their presence after great games after tough losses whatever it may be. But they have been unwavering in their support for our student-athletes — which is something myself and the rest of the staff really appreciate.” On deciding to practice outside: “At times to me it seems like it’s quite a bit of calculus and things that I’m not trained to go into. But John Mucovich our head AT; Dr. Mjaanes [Director of Intercollegiate and Health Service Sports Medicine and Head Team Physician] We have conversations about that not only today but we had conversations yesterday. How we’re gonna progress; how we’re going to find water breaks in between practice that are certain amount of times. Our guys sponging down; cold towels; water; freeze pops. I mean there is a method to all of it and myself and John are in constant communication as we navigate practice. “The indoor that we have here is incredible. We’ll continue to utilize it in scenarios where the weather is not gonna allow us to get done what we need to get done. If we’re anticipating good weather for our game and there’s poor weather outside well let’s practice in a controlled environment. But we can anticipate heat at Rutgers; we can anticipate heat at Duke — all things that we haven’t experienced very much of as we run through fall camp just because of the mild weather due to the lake. Today was a critical piece for our football team’s preparation to get in that heat keep get in that humidity and really start to prepare for what it’s going to feel like on game day. “About a week ago there was a very windy day that was not ideal for us to be in. To be honest with you at times practice seemed like it was some may consider a waste of time in terms of special teams and the ball blowing all over the place. But we all remember the conditions that we dealt with against Ohio State at home this past season. We have to prepare to win games on Saturday in the fall in the Big Ten. Any opportunity that we have to be in elements if we’re expecting to play in those elements at some point we’re going to take full advantage of.” On becoming acclimated over the last few months: “If you would have told me back in December that this was the story I would have I would have laughed and thought you were crazy. It has been a whirlwind. It’s been surreal in a lot of ways. But what I can tell you is I’m navigating it with faith I’m navigating it with prayer navigating with incredible people. That starts with my wife Kristin and our our three kids at home. They’ve been incredible supports. My mom and dad are an hour and 15 minutes away; they’ve been incredible supports. Kristin’s mom and dad are in town right now helping with the kids. The staff the coaches the support staff alumni people in the community. I mean my wife and I have been blown away with the character of people that are associated with Northwestern with Northwestern Athletics the surrounding community. We’ve it done with faith prayer and incredible people. “I’m just really excited to see this team. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: I’m so excited for this team to have an opportunity to go right write their own story. One thing I’m very confident in is when they look back on on the way that they’ve navigated this they’re gonna be really proud of the way they handled themselves.” On the creation of position groups’ unique decals: “Being very honest with you: I’m not sure. All I know is our equipment staff was having fun with the guys and our guys were fired up about having an opportunity to wear those to fall camp. There’s been some competitive banter. I think some of those logos on the helmet have played into that which is exactly what you want in fall camp.” On Sean McLaughlin: “I think it was just some street cred to be honest with you. I mean I’m really excited about that group. Sean’s been there done that in the Big Ten at a high level. He’s playing his best football right now which only helps right? I think Sean would be the first one to tell you that his production last year and the way they played towards the end of the year he wants more. Not that it was bad but he wants more. We all want more. He’s done an incredible job of setting the tone within that room. It’s been really fun to see.” On managing emotions entering the opener: “I think comes back to what we talked about a few minutes ago: just keeping our focus through the windshield and off the rearview mirror; what we can do to continue to build our preparation that creates confidence. I just talked to our team a few minutes ago about there’s no doubt in my mind that this team is worthy — the character the resolve the resiliency — that this team is worthy of doing something great. But now we have to build confidence. How do you build confidence? Not through saying you’re going to do something. It’s not through others telling you you’re going to do great or all those times you can’t do it and having this big chip on your shoulder. You create confidence by actually preparing to win and taking the proper steps to do that. “This program has done that at a high level especially when the odds have been against them in the past. I fully anticipate that we’ll do that again this year. But today was a start to that. Our guys just pushed through some heat. It’s Rutgers prep a ton of scout looks. It was ugly at times; far from perfect but our guys created some confidence today of pushing through hot humid limited numbers with scouts. It was a great opportunity for us to start that process.” On when he knew this team was “worthy” of succeeding: “It happened the way that they responded in July. They continued to show up and then they chose to stay. The way that they show up every day. This group is worthy of success. Now it’s time for us to go create confidence through our preparation.” On the leadership of McLaughlin and Cam Porter: “It’s a huge part of it. Again it comes back to just that street credibility. They’ve done it. When those guys speak people listen. And neither Sean or Cam overdo it but when they chime in people are listen. What’s the definition of good leadership? People follow. People follow Sean and Cam that’s for sure.” On team morale this late into camp: “It’s been incredible but it would be what you would anticipate any fall camp just from the standpoint of ‘Oh we’re in the thick of it.’ Now that we’re into Rutgers prep you can start to see a bounce in the guys’ step in terms of having a target on someone else other than competing against your own teammates. Our guys have responded. We’ve really pushed this group and they’ve responded well. The morale that you sense in this team meeting room and position meetings as guys are coming and going from the facility it’s not a bunch of talk. This group cares about one another deeply and is really excited about what’s ahead.” RB Cam Porter WR Cam Johnson DL Sean McLaughlin On new faces in the defensive line room (McLaughlin): “All those guys they’re characters. We had an interesting group already but those guys definitely have added some serious characters in the room in the best way possible. I think the D-line has grown tremendously as we have gone over spring ball over camp across everything. I think we’ve done a really good job trying to get better; learn from each other especially knowing those guys have played a lot of football. They’re all older have a lot of experience so we’re trying to learn everything that we can from them and trying to echo that down to the young guys as well.” On interacting with former players at practice (Porter): “It’s been awesome. Since my freshman year since I’ve been here former players always come back. They enjoy coming back. They enjoy giving us knowledge because they’ve been in our shoes. I mean they’ve experienced what we’ve experienced. It’s been great to talk to some of the alums and just catch up with how everything is going. So it’s been good.” On if alumni messaging has changed in light of controversy (Porter): “It really hasn’t changed at all. They’re just supportive of us supportive of the daily grind that we go through as student-athletes. They just continue to lift us up because we got a big season ahead.” On Johnson’s sixth fall camp and the receiver corps: “For one Coach Binns has been awesome. I think that he’s taught me a lot of new things. As a sixth-year guy you might have the attitude that you’ve got it all figured out but I think if you come in ready to learn every day that Coach Binns is gonna be able to really make you a complete receiver. We’ve got a ton of depth in the wide receiver room. So it’s been a competitive fall camp and it’s going to be to be competitive all year. I think there’ll be a lot of guys that’ll make some big plays for us this year.” On Braun’s transition (McLaughlin): “Coach Braun has been a tremendous asset for us. Coming in during spring ball really opened up our eyes to how we can play really good defense playing together and doing everything we need to do to be successful defensive in the Big Ten and even in the country. As he’s transitioning to head coach he’s still been primarily our defensive coordinator. It’s been really nice to see how he’s progressed and really handled the changes as we’ve gone along this course.” On goals for 2023 (McLaughlin): “Obviously the goal is to be the best we possibly can be. We have a lot to learn from going off last year’s tape and what we need to not do again and what we could do better. I think that’s going to help with a lot of guys that we have in the room. We took it on our shoulders to try and be the best position group in the team. I think we’ve done a really good job trying to get better. We’ve just got to keep stacking days and put all this stuff together. As we go throughout this course of the season I think it’ll be really good for us to see how well we stack up against some of the other better defenses in the Big Ten. I think just gotta keep going.” On facing coaching changes in different programs (Johnson): “This is actually my third coaching change. I think for me it’s just sort of understanding that I’ve been through a coaching change before things like that and sort of just being there for the guys who maybe this is their first time. Just trying to make sure that we’re focused on the first game because I think that’s been our message the whole time. We’re here to play football and that we’re going to have a successful season. Just making sure that the young guys would understand that and guys who need help I’m there for.” On Lausch’s abilities (Porter): “Like Coach said he’s a heck of an athlete. Finding different ways we’re going to use him is going to be very big for our offense for our team as well. He’s also a great leader on and off the field. Coach is 100% right. He’s a dynamic athlete that can definitely change the game.” On his role for 2023 (Porter): “It’s a blessing to be in the role that I’m in right now. But to be honest with you nothing changes. I’ve prepared the same way since the beginning. I take this game very serious and it means a lot to me. I think trying to change things could try to cause you to be something you’re not. I’m just gonna continue to try to stay consistent. Just keep being who I am.” On the team being “worthy” of success (McLaughlin): “I think we’ve put in a lot of work over the course of the offseason starting from the winter going through all that grind and then coming out through the summer. I think we put in a lot of work and we’ve just got to play to the best of our abilities and have confidence and conviction with what we do. I know a lot of guys believe that we’re going to have success but we’ve got to act on it and go out there and play like it.” On handling their feelings heading into Week One at Rutgers (McLaughlin): “I think first-game jitters are always a common thing. We’re going into a hostile environment in New Jersey I think that was going to not going to change regardless of anything that happened. I think we’re out there going to try and play the best of our abilities and go out there and try and get a W. I think that hasn’t changed since the minute we stepped on campus in Jan. 1 after the season ended last year. That’s our goal is to go out there and win. I think that’s what we’re going to try and do.” On why they stayed at Northwestern (order of McLaughlin Porter Johnson): “The guys in the locker room without a doubt. Those guys have been there from the minute I stepped on campus my freshman year. I don’t know what I would do with some of those guys that I’ve formed relationships with from guys that have graduated beyond some of the older D-lineman — Joe Spivak Trevor Kent — they’ve taught me some serious things that you can’t take away from any other place. I think the guys in the locker room have made this place special. It’s been that way for a while. I think. I just started to get to know Cam [Johnson] but Cam Porter has been with me over the course of this navigating COVID and everything along those lines. Formed bonds that will last forever I think that’s one of the biggest reasons why I stayed. I don’t know how they feel but that’s how I feel.” “I think for me just having gone through something like this before. The guys in the room in the whole football support staff everybody. The way that we all had conviction that we’re going to get through this together we’re going to make this a successful season regardless. That was something that I hadn’t seen in other schools. Sometimes whenever you go through the coaching changes people splintering and off things like that. Just to echo what he said I think that for any team I’ve been on in my six years this team is as close as as any I’ve been a part of. For me it was a no-brainer to stay and be with these guys and just enjoy my last year.” “I think Cam kind of hit the nail on the head. It was kind of a no-brainer. Like Shawn said as well we came together. We made a decision that we’re gonna make this a special season. We’re gonna come together and we’re gonna fight. We’re gonna try to win football games for this university.” On working with Bryant and Sullivan (Johnson): “I think that we have a lot of talent and depth in our quarterback room top to bottom. I think both of them I have a really good relationship with. Sully was the person that was my official visit host so we’ve been close from that moment. Ben’s gotten here and done an enormous job of getting closer with the guys spending time with us making sure we’re all working. I think that no matter who we go with on Sept. 3 that we’re going to be in good hands and that he’s going to be making great plays for the team.” On utilizing their experience with earlier success (Porter then McLaughlin): “I mean me and Sean were blessed to be a part of that 2020 team. I think the biggest thing with being a part of that is you know what it takes. You’ve been there before. You’ve been under leadership that has taken us to that place. So now that we’re leaders we know and understand what it’s going to take. It’s gonna take a lot of sacrifice a lot of hard work. Those experiences are just going to help us this season help carry us to our goals.” “Being a part of that team we were surrounded by a lot of great leaders. Kind of the same way COVID kind of brought us even closer together. Everything that happened so far we’ve gotten closer. I think we’ve got to come together even more if we’re gonna have a successful season. I think we all have done that so far and we’ve just go to put it into action and get back to where we want to be.”           \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Today we’ll wrap up previewing Northwestern’s final opponent of the 2023 season: the Illinois Fighting Illini. Following a renaissance season in 2022 under Bret Bielema the Illini look to make it consecutive years of producing NFL talent and having on-field success. The Basics Returning Production: 63% overall (64% offense 62% defense); 71st overall 2022 record: 8-5 (5-4 B1G) Head Coach: Bret Bielema (3rd season) The Stats The following metrics are courtesy of Bill Connelly and ESPN. You can read more about the rankings and theory behind them here. 2022 SP+ Overall: 21st 2022 SP+ Offense: 99th 2022 SP+ Defense: 2nd 2022 Capsule After a 2-6 season in 2020 with Lovie Smith at the helm Bielema brought Illinois back to a more competitive product on the field finishing the 2021 season 5-7 overall with a 4-5 record in conference and furthered that upward trend in 2022 as the Illini finished second in the Big Ten West with an 8-5 record. However while Illinois’ 2022 season included many highs there were lows as well. It started out well with a 38-6 victory over Wyoming in Week Zero. Illinois immediately suffered a setback however losing its Big Ten opener 23-20 on the road against Indiana. But the Illini responded quickly and valiantly. They won their last two non-conference games by three scores or more starting with a 24-3 win against eventual ACC cellar-dweller Virginia. Illinois then posted a 31-0 victory over FCS opponent Chattanooga to finish an undefeated non-conference slate. But with that loss to Indiana the Illini were starting the rest of conference play at a slight disadvantage. The Illini had a tough assignment as well playing Wisconsin on the road. Illinois was up to the challenge though claiming a 34-10 victory to notch its first victory over the Badgers in Madison since 2002.  Then in what was probably the sloppiest game of the season Illinois defeated Iowa 9-6 (yes that is a real football score) as the teams mirrored each other perfectly with great defense on either side. Illinois entered the AP Poll at No. 24 after that ugly victory but then defeated Minnesota 26-14 and all of a sudden the Illini had gone undefeated against the top three teams of the 2021 Big Ten West standings. Through seven games Illinois was 6-1 with a 3-1 conference record and entered a road matchup with Nebraska as the No. 17 team in the country. The Illini carried that momentum forward against the Huskers holding their sixth opponent out of eight games to 10 points or less. Bielema’s squad eventually defeated the Cornhuskers 26-9 to improve to 7-1 and No. 14 in the AP poll. Looking ahead Illinois had one extremely tough game left on the schedule a matchup with reigning Big Ten Champions — Michigan — in Ann Arbor. But looking ahead is exactly what the Illini were caught doing.  Defensive back Sydney Brown recorded an interception on the first play of the game against Michigan State but from then on — both in that game and in the season — everything went downhill. MSU which was 3-5 overall and 1-4 in conference heading into the weekend took a 23-7 lead into the fourth quarter; Illinois could not complete the comeback falling 23-15 to the Spartans. And yet everything was still right in front of Illinois. Purdue which was 3-3 in conference headed to Champaign in what proved to be a pivotal showdown in the Big Ten West race. Yet the Boilermakers proved to be Illinois’ kryptonite as Purdue’s Aidan O’Connell completed 62.5% of his passes for 237 yards and three touchdowns with only one interception to lead the Boilermakers to a 31-24 victory. Now in a tie atop the Big Ten West at 4-3 after dropping two games in a row Illinois had to rally to beat Michigan and Northwestern to close out the season and hope the chips fell their way to get to Indianapolis. While the Illini did give No. 3 Michigan its toughest test of the regular season forcing the Wolverines to kick a game-winning field goal with just nine seconds left moral victories were not enough at that point in the year.  Illinois won its season finale 41-3 against Northwestern to finish the season on a high note but unfortunately for the Illini their 5-4 conference record would leave them one game behind Purdue (6-3 in conference) for the opportunity to win the Big Ten West. Illinois drew a tough assignment in bowl season as the Illini matched up with the No. 20 Mississippi State Bulldogs who beat the Illini 19-10 in the ReliaQuest Bowl. Offensive Overview The Illini were weak overall on offense last season but they had one player who consistently made an impact. Lead running back Chase Brown brother of Sydney Brown (more on him later) ran for 1643 yards on 328 attempts. Yet Brown was selected in the fifth round of the 2023 NFL Draft so he will not factor into the 2023 Illinois offense. That is an important loss for the Illini as he ranked fourth among individual FBS rushing leaders despite Illinois ranking 55th in rushing yards per game as a team due to the lack of a real second threat behind Brown. However Illinois does return his backup in Reggie Love III who ran for 316 yards on 70 attempts. While Syracuse transfer Tommy DeVito set the Illinois record for completion percentage (69.6%) in his only year with the Illini in 2022 the Illinois still ranked 92nd with 211.8 passing yards per game just 1.5 yards per game ahead of Northwestern. Illinois also ranked a lowly 95th in FBS with 24.2 points per game. The best method to dealing with the loss of Brown is arguably to come out of the gates more balanced on offense and that is probably what the Illini will do. Another factor influencing the potential of the Illini offense in 2023 shifting its focus is incoming transfer Luke Altmyer. Altmyer was recruited to Ole Miss in the 2021 class where he was ranked as the 21st-best quarterback in the country according to the 247 Sports composite rankings but only saw significant time on the field when Matt Corral suffered an injury in the 2021 Sugar Bowl. Altmyer finished that game 15-for-28 with 174 yards one touchdown and two interceptions but Baylor’s defense was suffocating in 2021 and he was only a freshman. The other potential upside for the Illini is that three of its top four wide receivers — Isaiah Williams Pat Bryant and Casey Washington — as well as their most productive tight end — Tip Reiman — from 2022 are returning. The Illini receiving corps should be in a good spot as a result of those four returning likely allowing Illinois to balance out its offensive production more in 2023. Although the offensive philosophy of being a run-first team still might not change Illinois should be more efficient when they it does turn to its passing game. The play split of runs to passes should be closer to even which in comparison to 57.9% run plays last year would count as becoming less one-dimensional offensively. Defensive Overview Unfortunately for Bielema his biggest challenge might actually be fixing the defense in 2023. Although the Illini finished 2022 second in SP+ defensive rankings a lot of that success was due to Illinois’ stacked secondary. Three players from that unit got drafted in the first three rounds of the 2023 NFL Draft: Devon Witherspoon (No. 5 overall pick) Jartavius Martin (second round No. 47 overall) and Sydney Brown (third round No. 66 overall). That means Illinois is not only looking to replace three open starting spots in the secondary but also three high-level players.  The Fighting Illini defense led the country with 24 interceptions and ranked eighth in passing yards allowed per game (173.8 yards per game). While those numbers are likely not going to be matched by the 2023 squad the passing defense remains a focal point of Illinois’ system and could be a strong suit once again this year. Although the secondary has two transfers projected as starters in FIU transfer Demetrius Hill and JUCO transfer Kaleb Patterson and is replacing a lot of production from the back-end the defense has some quality returners as well. Defensive lineman Jer’Zhan Newton — who led the team with 14 tackles for loss and 5.5 sacks last season — and fellow defensive lineman Keith Randolph Jr. — who ranked second with 13 TFL and 4.5 sacks — are both returning to anchor the defensive line in 2022. The pressure generated by a front seven that also retains three linebackers who ranked in the team’s top ten tacklers in 2022 along with Newton and Randolph will help out with the relatively inexperienced secondary. While Illinois’ passing defense might see some regression the Illini front seven should spearhead what will likely still be one of the better defensive units in the conference. Three Players to Watch QB Luke Altmyer As discussed before Altmyer had limited playing time at Ole Miss after backing up Matt Corral as a freshman and then losing the QB competition in 2022 to USC transfer Jaxson Dart. Just looking at Altmyer’s offer list which included Florida State (who Altmyer originally committed to) Alabama Oregon and LSU among others his talent is apparent. Although things did not look good on paper against Baylor in 2021 that defense was 10th in the nation in points allowed per game (18.3) that year so the circumstances surrounding that game put Altmyer in a very tough spot. Altmyer even showed some flashes in that matchup but the reality is there is not much on-field production to showcase Altmyer’s talent. That is what lands him as the most important player to watch. He was officially named the starter earlier this week and if whatever the Illini coaching staff (as well as 2021 coaches on the recruiting trail) saw shows up on the field as well Illinois could improve offensively in 2023. However if Altmyer struggles out of the gates Illinois would likely have to turn to Ball State transfer John Paddock who threw for 2719 yards and 18 touchdowns in 2022 but also led all of FBS with 14 interceptions. Altmyer’s play under center is going to be the driving force of Illinois’ season no matter how it turns out. DL Jer’Zhan Newton I hinted at Newton’s impact when giving the overview of the Illini defense but it is really important to talk about the importance Newton will have on the 2022 Illini. Newton was named to the All-Big Ten First Team in 2022 and other than Randolph none of Illinois’ five All-Big Ten selections on defense are returning. Teams tried to run on Illinois often to avoid throwing into its secondary in 2022; while there might be fewer opportunities for Newton to match his effectiveness from last year he can be just as if not more productive by impacting the passing game in 2023.  Newton had the opportunity to declare for the 2023 NFL Draft but he decided to return to the Illini for the 2023 season. Newton and Randolph will likely have to put the Illini defense on their collective backs next year by disrupting everything in the trenches. If Newton can recreate his 2022 or somehow improve on his previous season he could easily end up as a first-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft while anchoring a defensive-minded Illinois team. DB Demetrius Hill Hill was an FWAA Freshman All-American in 2022 at FIU. Hill finished 2022 with 95 total tackles 3.5 tackles for loss one sack three pass deflections and three forced fumbles in his redshirt freshman season for the Golden Panthers and will be tasked with filling an important role within Illinois’ defense. In 2023 the Illini will be without 2022 starting safeties Sydney Brown and Kendall Smith and Hill’s role will be to help fill that void by working alongside Matthew Bailey who tallied three interceptions two passes defended and one fumble recovery last year. Bailey is more of a known commodity when it comes to playing in the Big Ten as he appeared in all 13 Illinois games last year as a true freshman but Hill’s adjustment to the better competition in the Big Ten will be key for Illinois. If Bailey can follow up his amazing freshman season with the typical level of improvement from freshman to sophomore seasons he will contend for a spot on one of the All-Big Ten teams and the Illini will continue to have an elite defense in 2023. If Hill struggles with the adjustment though Illinois’ secondary will likely be viewed as a weak point of the defense with so many unknowns.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story The 2023-24 athletic year has already begun for Northwestern with no Wildcat team having dropped a game thus far (sincerely hoping this isn’t a jinx). Following what is likely the wildest and most controversial summer in school history and with NU football returning in only eight days here are our answers to your fall-themed questions. “Which @NUFHCats matchup are you most excited for and why?” -@_kaylacohen Iggy: Thursday the 26th of October. Save the date. Start off your Halloweekend by heading over to Lakeside Field at 3 p.m. to watch the nation’s preseason No. 2 and No. 3 teams — Northwestern and Maryland — face off in their final regular season games. Not only is this a rematch of the national semifinal conference tournament seeding could also very well be on the line. Given that the Big Ten might be more stacked in field hockey than the SEC is in football (FIVE of the nation’s top seven schools come from the B1G) any chance at securing a bye and avoiding an extra match is a golden opportunity. If that’s at stake in two months this one should feel like a playoff atmosphere. All three matches between the Terps and the ‘Cats were decided by a goal in 2022 and the regular season clash should be no different. There should be intriguing matchups all over the pitch; one that stands out to me is how an Alia Marshall-led defense will try to shut down All-American forward Hope Rose and a lethal Maryland attack that ranked third in the NCAA in goals per game last year. Don’t get me wrong there are lots of great games on Northwestern’s schedule — look no further than tomorrow’s opener — but I don’t think it gets any better than this when it comes to regular season action. Bradley: Iggy stole what would have been my answer so I’ll go with NU’s game against Iowa on Oct. 6. Last year the Wildcats and Hawkeyes played two phenomenal contests. In the first matchup Northwestern lost 2-0 but the ‘Cats had 16 shots to Iowa’s three (yes you read that right). A terrific outing by GK Grace McGuire led the visitors to an improbable win. Then the teams squared off in the second round of the NCAA Tournament which proved to be a true thriller. Northwestern prevailed 2-1 edging Iowa 4-3 in a penalty shootout after two overtimes. Expect more fireworks between the preseason No. 2 and No. 7 squads who both figure to be in contention for the Big Ten title in 2023 despite losing some key members. “How is everyone feeling about covering the team? Fully support the team as it currently exists? Conflicted? Not supporting the team just keeping it professional and covering them? (Limiting it to football but expand as you see fit)” -@Cyan220 Bradley: Conflicted would be a good way to describe it for me. As a Northwestern student I want to see my peers (and David Braun) do well and for the school and the surrounding community to experience a successful enjoyable season — especially after the ‘Cats went 4-20 in 2021-22. Heck it’s beneficial if the team does well for even those of us covering it with more energy and optimism unique storylines and even high-stakes games to attend. At the same time it’s impossible for me to view the upcoming season from purely a football lens with all that’s been revealed — with lots of questions lingering about coaches team culture players’ involvement and what we still don’t know. Those emotions might start to dissipate a bit as we move into October and November but this scandal will permeate for several years. It’s natural for people at Northwestern or in the Wildcats’ fanbase to be unsure of how to react and likely will be the case until more healing can be done. Iggy: Having never been through anything like this before I’d be lying if I said I could give you a definitive answer about how I feel right now. What puts this into perspective for me is that there are members of the program who got to Northwestern after January. They dealt with an administration and investigation for a team they weren’t part of. I can’t speak for them of course but I’d bet they in particular have been through much more than we have these past few weeks. Even though you asked more about the coverage side rather than the fandom side I think it’s important to stress that INU is a mix of both to an extent. I’m going to root for this team and I want it to succeed. But as Bradley said there’s so much that hasn’t been uncovered and it won’t be unless the public gets access to the full report. There are a couple of things especially the characterization of this scandal as mere “adversity” that can be put into the past with on-field play and team unity alone that I feel uneasy about. Ultimately though our job isn’t supposed to be easy. This is a team that is a fundamental part of the Northwestern sports community that this site’s audience belongs to and it’s our responsibility to cover it. “Rank the following WR’s by where you expect them to finish the year in yards receiving: Johnson Kirtz Henning Fleurima Covey Gray Gill. Bradley “Inside Sources” Locker didn’t have Fleurima listed anywhere in his WR heirarchy tweets which is a concern.” -@Bklynmarketer Bradley: For one I appreciate the cheeky nickname “Inside Sources” (probably one of my favorite negative things said so far to be honest) but my only real exposure to the team’s practice sessions was via a 45-minute drills period during one day. Rather based on what I project for this receiver room and what Northwestern football has shared on social media there hasn’t been much discussion or footage of Fleurima working with the starters. He was a highly touted recruit for a reason but played only 16 snaps last season. I would say he’s definitively behind at least Johnson Henning Kirtz and Gill if not Covey but there’s certainly a chance he could break onto the scene in a WR corps that doesn’t have solidified depth. In terms of my prediction for receiving yards I’d lean Johnson then Henning Kirtz Gill Covey Gray and Fleurima. I would have put Henning first but my guess is that Northwestern will try to give him considerable touches on sweeps and other run plays which might diminish his receiving total. Also it seems that the team is decently high on Covey so he’s a sleeper to watch. Iggy: Henning Johnson Kirtz Gill Gray Covey Fleurima. I think it’s key to note how heavily Mike Bajakian and his QB room worked the slot last year. Everyone knew that Malik Washington would headline the 2022 room before the season started but I don’t know if anyone predicted that Washington would nearly triple Donny Navarro III’s output. That’s why  I feel like Henning will be the leader with Johnson and Kirtz following closely behind. I’ll slot Gill fourth since he was the biggest deep threat last year of the remaining receivers with Gray Covey and Fleurima being a toss-up depending on who sees the most playing time down the stretch. “What are some fun ideas of non-NUFB things to do on fall Saturdays in Evanston/Chicago?” -@BenChasen_ via Instagram Iggy: The obvious (and best) answer is going to the Evanston Farmers’ Market which runs on Saturday mornings until the beginning of November. I really enjoy the local farmers’ market in my hometown which is how I found out about Evanston’s in freshman year but I would go so far as saying Maple Avenue’s market blows the other one out of the water. Other cool things:  Bradley: To add on to Iggy’s great list checking out some of Chicago’s notable museums is always a great time especially the Field Museum Museum of Science and Industry and even Chicago Sports Museum. Also walking around campus and admiring the changing colors of the leaves (especially in Shakespeare Garden) wouldn’t disappoint. There should be some fun concerts too like 50 Cent Bob Dylan and more. Personally my answer is usually to bask in other college football — we need to savor PAC-12 After Dark while we can and my Student Media Poll top-25 rankings won’t create themselves. “After back-to-back 1-11 seasons and the unmitigated disaster that was this summer Northwestern football has clearly destroyed any sort of momentum their program had built up in the solid 2015-20 stretch. Does this program have a path back to relevance? If so what does that even look like?” -JWoodNU Bradley: The 2023 season might very well be another bleak one but I’d point to November as to what could be a pivotal point in returning to stability and success. At the end of the year the Wildcats will begin evaluating what they want to do at head coach. If David Braun doesn’t steer the ‘Cats to at least four or five wins I’d expect Derrick Gragg (or whoever the athletic director is at the time) and the school’s administration to seek a long-term high-profile candidate to begin to rebuild the team and its values. If Northwestern lands either a well-respected veteran or a flashy up-and-comer that could provide major dividends in recruiting. Just look at how schools with eye-catching new head coaches in the last few years (e.g. Nebraska UCF) have flipped a switch and become destinations for premier talent. In terms of traits that new coach should possess understanding how to utilize the modern framework of college football (namely NIL and the transfer portal) plus implementing a contemporary style of football (with specific focus on offensive creativity) are paramount. Pat Fitzgerald was not highly effective at either and it’s a big reason why NU has been very poor in three of the last four years. At the end of the day the choice for the Wildcats’ next leader after this year will be the most important step in restoring the program and its hopes of contending for a Big Ten title whether that’s Braun or an outsider. It’s not overly outlandish to think that Northwestern could become competitive again as soon as 2024 or 2025 because turnarounds can be swift in college football but that’s largely predicated on hiring the right coach constructing a good staff landing top talent and maximizing existing players’ skills. “The coaches that wore the #51 Cats’ Against The World shirt will they never get a job in the future due to them publicly defending Fitz?” -@JacobBerger2022 Bradley: I wouldn’t say they’ll never get jobs because many of them are still coaches that would be sought after if they left Evanston. In terms of their stances their support of Fitzgerald is one that is probably not rare across the country and on different campuses. I would sincerely doubt that them wearing those shirts — despite the controversy it sparked and it forcing Gragg to call them “inappropriate” and “tone deaf” — would inhibit their future employment as coaches. “Basketball season is still around 2 months away but I haven’t seen anyone talking about it so I’ll speak up about the subject: Is Coach McKeown on the hot seat entering the 2023-24 season? He has been overall a pretty solid head coach at Northwestern but last year was awful and this year doesn’t look much better if I’m not mistaken.” -Purduefan2022 Bradley: McKeown is only under contract for two more seasons including the one ahead. As you mentioned he’s been successful in Evanston and is a widely respected figure in the sport of basketball. I would have a hard time believing that Northwestern would fire McKeown — with one more extra year on his deal — if Gragg didn’t do so with Chris Collins after 2021-22 even if the Wildcats struggle again in 2023-24. The year ahead does look somewhat gloomy minus Sydney Wood and Courtney Shaw but growth from players like Caroline Lau and Hailey Weaver — plus continued production from Caileigh Walsh and Paige Mott — means that NU should experience some upward trends. Iggy: Coincidentally the Big Ten is about as strong as it’s ever been right when Northwestern enters a multi-year rebuilding phase for the first time in about a decade. I agree with Bradley here; I think the ‘Cats would have to be worse than last year for Derrick Gragg to even consider letting go of McKeown before his contract ends. And it’s not like the recruiting pipeline has gone dry either. He’s already gotten Butler College Prep point guard Xamiya Walton ESPN’s No. 53 2024 recruit to commit to Northwestern. This team is still young with a bunch of talented players and it should be competitive again in 2024-25. If it isn’t then I think it’s worth wondering if NU will renew his contract. “What’s the best way to decarbonize the transportation sector?” -Tristan Jung via Instagram Iggy: Limiting this to Northwestern (and Chicago sort of) here’s the plan. My City Council campaign begins now: VERY thankful I’m not enduring the disgusting heat wave in Evanston right now but swimming/paddleboarding/sailing to class through the Lakefill in 100-degree weather would be incredible. If that $480 million for the new Ryan Field happens to go somewhere else go get some sailboats. Better yet let students sail down Lake Michigan from Evanston Campus to Chicago Campus. Even when this campus is frozen over as it tends to be six months a year taking pictures like you’re George Washington crossing the Delaware River will be unforgettable. Carbon emissions from those weekend Ubers and Red Line rides won’t be the only footprint disappearing; that financial footprint will also shrink.  If this doesn’t scream “and is in my DNA” I really don’t know what does. Not to mention that the new tuition bills would hit harder than a windmill — now that’s what I call decarbonization. Bradley: I nominate Iggy to be the next Secretary of Transportation based on that answer alone. “I guess the subject I’d be curious to hear you discuss is what you ask staffers do to get up to speed on NU’s history in order to fully appreciate the context in which their reporting unfolds. I ask as a predicate to asking (with the assumption that you all had previous opinions on stories that pre-dated some or all of your time at Inside NU): Have the current summer’s athletic department scandals in any way changed your perspective on Northwestern’s role in the Rashidi Wheeler tragedy the Kain Colter/CAPA story the Johnny Vassar story or the Hayden Richardson story?” -NU’06er Iggy: This will be long so please bear with me. Honestly this is one of the best questions we’ve ever had. It’s a tough one. Regarding the first part it really depends because everyone’s fan experiences prior to NU widely differ. On one hand we’ve had multiple writers on staff (and even on our executive board currently) from Greater Chicago who weren’t just familiar with Northwestern football before college; they grew up with it. On the other hand you have people like me. I’m from New York City and I wasn’t at all passionate about Northwestern football or really any other college team for that matter going into NU.   Because of that we’ve tended to have a pretty hands-off approach for staffers since I’ve been at INU when it comes to teaching them about the program’s history beyond say five years ago. If someone takes or pitches an article that requires them to incorporate historical knowledge then we’ll expect them to do the research or ask for help but they don’t typically have to encounter hard reporting from the jump (or even at all if they don’t want to) that touches the sensitive stories like Colter’s Wheeler’s or even ones like Randy Walker’s and Mike Polisky’s.  From my experience becoming a managing editor last spring I remember just taking the initiative to read a bunch of stories (and even the comments) here and elsewhere. I distinctly remember reading through Henry Bushnell’s oral history on the 1995 team which might be the best thing this site has ever published. It wasn’t even just so I could feel capable of covering the teams more deeply it was more so because the conversations within exec were at a high enough level where I felt like I needed to do my homework to keep up with everyone else. Typically because the staffers we promote to exec have demonstrated significant interest in NU sports and the site already they’ll take the initiative to learn more themselves. That being said I’m not sure if anything would have prepared me for this summer. It’s worth noting that our executive board did all of the site’s reporting for everything that took place which I think made it easier for everyone to grasp how monumental this was in considering the historical path of the football program.  Of the cases you mentioned I was most familiar with Richardson’s and Wheeler’s before July (North by Northwestern’s 2016 story on Wheeler’s on-campus legacy is a terrific read). Both to differing extents involve administrative officials trying to quell the impact of two horrifying incidents that directly involved higher-ups. The Wheeler tragedy really stands out to me because if you go back and read The Daily Northwestern’s 2003 story on Dr. Mark Gardner admitting he acted alone in burning the records from Wheeler’s physical the Northwestern administrator’s quote tries to detach NU from the situation without showing any sympathy for Wheeler’s parents. The administrator did so even though the university had employed Gardner in 2001 when Wheeler died. No matter what your perspective is on the hazing scandal I think most can agree that Derrick Gragg Michael Schill and the Northwestern administration as a whole have primarily aimed to soften the PR and legal blow for the school as much as possible. Whether the consensus has agreed with them or not — and more often than not it hasn’t — that’s what has happened. Thus this really solidified the view I already had: when it comes to situations involving the transparency of sensitive information higher educational administrations need to be viewed with some skepticism at least initially because they’ve historically put their own self-interest ahead of the best interest of the student-athletes. Bradley: I was a Northwestern fan before I was a student and an INU writer so I felt pretty sound in my understanding of the school and its recent athletic history. But we recommend for all of our new writers to at least be aware of how Wildcat teams have performed in the last five years plus understand program greats and important contexts (e.g. that men’s basketball has only made the NCAA Tournament twice the longstanding success of lacrosse/softball/field hockey or football’s Rose Bowl journey). There aren’t exactly specific articles that we make staffers read or games they have to re-watch (if I were to pick one though I’d probably go with the 2017 MBB win over Michigan) but we expect writers to have baseline knowledge. The events of this summer have definitely opened my eyes to the questionable intentions of Northwestern’s athletic department specifically to minimize the concerns of student-athletes despite large-scale endemic issues. Along those lines what has been uncovered about NU’s hazing incidents in football and volleyball plus how Gragg handled the hiring (and “firing”) of Jim Foster grants credence to the stories of Vassar and Richardson. It’s clear that the university does not have a scot-free past with investigating itself or living up to its deep-seated guidelines which the details from early July onward reinforce. Hopefully we’ll start to see positive change and more concrete support of student-athletes particularly potential victims moving forward — not just in Evanston but everywhere.         \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

Share this story After 229 days without amusing Dr. Pepper commercials eerie mascots galore and the inherent zaniness of the sport college football is officially back with No. 13 Notre Dame and Navy kickstarting the 2023 FBS season in Dublin Ireland (the Irish can only hope to be as successful as Northwestern was there). Boy does it feel good to be back. For fans of the Wildcats the wait is a bit longer stretching until the traditional Week One when the team will travel to Piscataway New Jersey and take on Rutgers. With NU starting to conclude its lengthy fall camp and shift into game week preparation here are notable tidbits about every nook and cranny of the ‘Cats’ 2023 schedule. Week One: at Rutgers (Piscataway New Jersey) This year will mark the fourth straight that Northwestern begins against a Big Ten opponent having beaten Nebraska last year fallen to Michigan State in 2021 and dominated Maryland in 2020. The team hasn’t played against a conference foe to start a season four straight times since 1979-82. As for the day of the game NU hasn’t ever played on a Sunday. All-time the Wildcats are 2-3 against the Scarlet Knights. Of course the program’s last win in America came against RU in Oct. 2021. Northwestern is on a two-game winning streak against Rutgers dating back to 2018 but is 1-2 battling the team in New Jersey. Interestingly enough the ‘Cats have never scored more than 27 points against the Scarlet Knights while Rutgers has averaged only 22 points per game vs. NU — Sept. 3 could very well prove to be another low-scoring affair between the two. Week Two: UTEP Miners (Evanston Illinois) It might come as little surprise to learn that UTEP and Northwestern have never squared off on the gridiron. The Miners play in Conference USA meaning that this will be the Wildcats’ first contest against that conference since beating Rice on Nov. 12 2011. NU’s 2:30 p.m. CT kickoff will mark the latest for a home opener since it began the 2021 season in primetime vs. MSU. More specifically it’s the latest kick for a Saturday beginner since 2020 against the Terrapins. Week Three: at Duke Blue Devils (Durham North Carolina) While the ‘Cats are 10-12 all-time against the Blue Devils the last few years have not been kind to the purple and white against their ACC foe. Duke has bested Northwestern each of the past four matchups (dating back to 2017) with last year’s heartbreaker serving as a nail in the metaphorical coffin. NU’s last win in Durham came in 2015 with (now retired) Justin Jackson leading the charge. The ‘Cats will be seeking their first win against an ACC competitor since defeating Pitt in the 2016 Pinstripe Bowl. Week Four: Minnesota Golden Gophers (Evanston Illinois) These Big Ten West foes will have played in each of the last three years plus 16 of the past 17 seasons. However the contests have not been entirely competitive of late with Minnesota winning the last three by a combined score of 110-39. All time the Wildcats’ record against the Gophers is 36-56-5. Northwestern’s last win over Minnesota at Ryan Field came in 2017. With the game played on Sept. 23 this will be the earliest ever duel between NU and UMN in a season. Week Five: Penn State Nittany Lions (Evanston Illinois) 2023 will mark the third matchup between Northwestern and Penn State since 2016 but the second in two years. In each of their prior two games vs. PSU the Wildcats have scored only seven points. Yet Northwestern beat the Nittany Lions at home as recently as 2015 when Jackson outrushed Saquon Barkley and posted a gaudy 195 scrimmage yards. The all-time record for NU against Penn State is 5-15 but the last four matchups have been an even 2-2 so this one could sway favor. Week Six: Howard Bison (Evanston Illinois) As with UTEP it should stun few to learn that Howard and Northwestern have never faced one another in football. This Oct. 7 matchup is also set to serve as the school’s Homecoming game; it will be the first time the Wildcats have not opposed a Big Ten team on Homecoming since at least 1998. Moreover this game will be the third straight played by the ‘Cats in Ryan Field. Other recent years that have had that phenomenon are 2022 2019 2018 and 2016. Week Seven: Bye Unlike last year when the ‘Cats had two separate weeks without a game this year will be more traditional in having a bye that’s smack dab in the middle of the season. The 2022 team also had a reprieve with six games under its belt. Week Eight: at Nebraska Cornhuskers (Lincoln Nebraska) These recent intra-division rivals have vacillated which side emerges victorious every year since 2018 which might be a bad omen for the Wildcats this time around. However if the ‘Cats do beat the Huskers — their last team defeated — for the second straight season they will have done so in consecutive campaigns for the first time since 2017-18. In their two long histories Northwestern and Nebraska have only played 16 times with the Cornhuskers holding a 9-7 advantage. When playing in Lincoln the ‘Cats have gone 3-5 with the last W in Memorial Stadium coming in 2017. NU’s last trip to Nebraska was nightmarish ending with a 56-7 final. Week Nine: Maryland Terrapins (Evanston Illinois) Maryland is one of just two conference teams against which Northwestern has a winning record with the other being Indiana. The ‘Cats and Terps have played only three times with three of the eventual four meetings occurring since 2020. The lone time that Northwestern hosted Maryland was highly fruitful. To kickstart an eventual Citrus Bowl-winning 2020 season the Wildcats blasted UMD 43-3 collecting three interceptions of Taulia Tagovailoa and rushing for 325 yards and four touchdowns. Week 10: Iowa Hawkeyes (Chicago Illinois) While the Wildcats and Hawkeyes have gone toe-to-toe each of the last 18 seasons with NU winning 10 of those 18 Iowa has enjoyed a recent swing of success. Kirk Ferentz & Co. have beaten Northwestern in three of the last four years securing a 90-46 scoring margin in that span. The ‘Cats will look to turn the tide in Wrigley Field where the team last played in 2021 against Purdue. 2023 will prove to be the school’s third football game played in the Friendly Confines but the Wildcats are 0-2 so far on Addison and Clark. Week 11: at Wisconsin Badgers (Madison Wisconsin) Iowa and Wisconsin each have parallels as opponents for Northwestern. Despite back-and-forth affairs this century the other Big Ten West school has started to prevail since 2021. More specifically UW has won the last two games against the ‘Cats and in dominant fashion. Playing in Camp Randall Stadium has been daunting for Northwestern as the purple and white have not left Madison victors since 2015. Since 2000 NU has gone a measly 2-7 up north. Week 12: Purdue Boilermakers (Evanston Illinois) After ripping off five straight wins over Purdue from 2014-18 the Wildcats have dropped three of the last four to the Boilermakers including two home matchups. This game will be the first against the two sides in Evanston since 2019. When facing Purdue in Chicago or Evanston Northwestern has gone 4-6 in the 21st century. Likewise if the Boilermakers are able to beat NU for the third straight year it would prove to be their longest stretch of wins against the ‘Cats since they took seven in a row from 1997-2003. Week 13: at Illinois Fighting Illini (Champaign Illinois) Northwestern dominated the HAT rivalry for quite some time but the Illini have returned with a vengeance against their in-state rivals claiming the last two trophies — and scoring 41 or more points in both instances. If you’re looking for reasons for a turnaround against Illinois NU isn’t exactly a stranger to winning downstate having gone 6-3 in Champaign since 2003 including 3-1 since 2013. Further the Illini haven’t claimed three consecutively over Northwestern since 1988-90. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story As Week Zero of college football kicks off the Wildcats are eight days away from beginning their 2023 season but who will be under center remains a mystery. In Wednesday’s press conference interim head coach David Braun declined to name a starting quarterback for the year saying that the coaching staff has not reached that decision. Braun said that Ben Bryant and Brendan Sullivan have received a majority of the reps but the pair of signal callers are still splitting time with the first team. The sixth-year transfer from Cincinnati and the junior have been in a battle for the starting gig all training camp yet neither seems to have pulled away with the role. Braun said the Wildcats will have a mock game at Ryan Field on Saturday so both gunslingers will have one final shot to prove they deserve to lead the ‘Cats’ offense in Piscataway New Jersey. Despite the uncertainty on who is under center one thing is clear: NU’s offense will look very different based on who is QB1. When the ‘Cats take the field a week from Sunday it is up to the QB to guide the offense; here is what the offense could look like under either Bryant or Sullivan. Ben Bryant-led Offense Now entering his final year of eligibility Bryant has developed into a solid collegiate quarterback. In 2022 with the Bearcats Bryant started 11 games for UC throwing for 2732 yards 21 touchdowns and seven interceptions. Comparatively all five of Northwestern’s quarterbacks only tossed for 2524 yards 10 touchdowns and 17 interceptions last year. After losing the QB competition at Cincinnati this spring Bryant transferred to NU to win the job and make an instant impact for the Wildcats. If Bryant is named the starter expect Northwestern to execute a more pro-style/West Coast offense. Bryant is as pure of a pocket passer as they come displaying good presence inside the tackles and rarely taking off. In fact according to PFF Bryant only had five designed QB runs all of last season. Where the sixth-year thrives is his ability to get through his progression and find the open target. No. 2 understands what defenses are trying to do and can move defenders with his eyes. In 2022 he completed over 50% of passes in the 10+-yard range in the middle of the field where safeties usually roam in zone coverage.  In a Bryant-led offense expect a lot of traditional passing concepts. Whether it is a drive spot or flood concept Mike Bajakian should let Bryant get into his three- or five-step drop work through his read and find the open target. Now with a pocket passer the running game needs to be strong as well. There is a lot of pressure on NU’s offensive line with Bryant under center because the graduate transfer struggles to escape and improvise. With the ‘Cats’ speed at the skill position Bryant’s big arm can create splash plays on the perimeter. His footwork is sound which allows for him to take his drop and let it fly generating power from his lower half. Last season Northwestern quarterbacks found themselves throwing off their back foot often taking juice off the ball and allowing defenders to come make the play.  One area of No. 2’s game that should excite Wildcats’ fans is his ability to protect the football. In 2022 NU’s signal callers had 17 interceptions the third most in the Power Five. On the other hand Bryant only had seven picks. Now he does need to cut down on fumbles but overall the sixth-year did a good job keeping the ball out of opponents’ hands. Football coaches have said for a long time that if a team loses the turnover battle it is highly likely to lose the game and that was the case in many of the ‘Cats’ defeats last season; however with Bryant at the helm Braun can trust that the graduate transfer will make a good decision with the football and will help NU air it out and win games. Brendan Sullivan-led Offense Sullivan a rising junior would run a much different offense than his sixth-year counterpart. In his four starts last season Sullivan showed promise with his arm but relied heavily on his legs for production. The junior did complete 74% of his passes yet accumulated fewer than 600 yards passing. Although not entirely his fault Sullivan struggled to pick up large chunks at a time attempting fewer than 10 passes 20+ yards down the field. However No. 6’s ability to avoid sacks and improvise is very impressive. He makes plays with his legs constantly exemplified by picking up 161 yards on the ground. If the ‘Cats turn to Sullivan full-time in 2023 expect to see a spread-style offense full of designed quarterback keepers and RPOs. Sullivan’s legs open a new page in the playbook forcing defenses to key the QB too in run plays. In 2022 Sullivan had 10 designed QB runs and nearly 30 passing attempts behind the line of scrimmage. To help the young quarterback limit mistakes Bajakian attempted to get the ball out of Sullivan’s hands quickly. It worked as Sullivan did not turn the ball over in his last two starts. After 2022 there was a lot of room for improvement in No. 6’s game. Specifically he needs to be better at working through his progression to find the open receiver. Sullivan found himself locking in on his first read and if it was not there instantly going to his checkdown or running. This year he needs to show he can get to that second and third read if he wants to win the starting job. It is to be noted that Sullivan was the presumed starter during spring practice; however following the conclusion of spring ball NU did go out into the portal and get Bryant. Whether or not Sullivan has progressed to where he needs to be is unknown as all but one practice and scrimmage have been closed to the media. While Sullivan showed flashes of potential last season it is still unknown how he would fare for an entire 12-game season. Who Will It Be? In pure speculation I would expect Bryant to be the starter when the ‘Cats take the field in New Jersey. The veteran’s consistency and ability to protect the football will help NU stay in games as the Wildcats will have a chance to actually win the turnover battle.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Of course these additions do not come without departures with the retirement of 27-year old running back Justin Jackson being the most notable. Joe Jones the 29-year old linebacker who most recently played with the Titans is not yet under contract. Peter Skoronski: OL Tennessee Titans The Titans used the 11th overall pick on Skoronski in this year’s draft hoping he would bolster their offensive line making the Illinois native the first Wildcat to be drafted in the first round since Rashawn Slater and Greg Newsome II in 2021. Skoronski is expected to be the Titans starting left guard in an offensive line unit that Pro Football Focus ranks as the league’s worst going into the season. They have a mountain of a man in Derrick Henry to run the ball but Titans quarterbacks were sacked a whopping 49 times in 2022 a bottom five mark in the league and a testament to how much help they need blocking opposing linemen. Peter Skoronski just might be the man for the job and the preseason did nothing to say otherwise. Week 1 matchup: @ New Orleans Saints (9/10 12:00 PM CT) Evan Hull: RB Indianapolis Colts Who would’ve thought that there was a legitimate non-zero chance of Evan Hull getting a decent amount of carries early in the Colts season? Probably not a lot of people but thanks to Jonathan Taylor’s trade request and Zack Moss’s broken arm Hull will likely find himself top two on the Colts depth chart come September 10. Just a year removed from finishing tenth in the Big Ten in rushing yards and fifth in rushing attempts Hull might find himself with a heavy workload once again in Indianapolis. It’s unclear what this offense will look like under new head coach Shane Steichen and versatile rookie quarterback Anthony Richardson but with inexperience across the board Hull and the running back corps should be given some extended run.  Across three preseason games Hull had a relatively pedestrian 17 carries for 53 yards and a touchdown. The 3.1 yards a carry is lower than the Colts would like to see but in Taylor’s absence Hull showed off his abilities in pass protection which could allow him to see the field early and often on crucial third downs. Week 1 matchup: vs. Jacksonville Jaguars (9/10 12:00 PM CT) Adetomiwa Adebawore: DE Indianapolis Colts Joining Hull on the Colts is Adebawore who wowed scouts at the NFL combine and saw his draft stock rise as a result. Adebawore didn’t own the Big Ten leaderboards in 2022 but in his 12 games played he was able to force two fumbles and record an impressive nine tackles for a loss. Adebawore will have to make his mark on a middle-of-the-pack defensive line in Indianapolis in which he currently sits second on the left defensive tackle depth chart behind veteran Pro Bowler DeForest Buckner. But like Hull on a team with lower expectations to win now he will likely be given a shot to prove himself in the defensive line rotation. Week 1 matchup: vs. Jacksonville Jaguars (9/10 12:00 PM CT) Rashawn Slater: OL Los Angeles Chargers After being limited to just three games in 2022 due to a biceps injury Slater the Chargers’ 2021 first round pick is back and ready to prove that he is one of the best tackles in the league. The Chargers undoubtedly missed the intimidating presence of Slater on their offensive line in 2022 which can be shown in their team stats. Their running backs averaged just 3.8 yards per attempt ranking 30th in the league and down from 4.3 with Slater in 2021. In addition Chargers quarterbacks were sacked 39 times in 2022 compared to just 31 the year prior. Considering that those aforementioned position groups are anchored by Austin Ekeler and Justin Herbert respectively it’s not farfetched to say that Slater’s absence directly contributed to the Chargers dip in offensive production. But with Slater ready to begin what should be his second full season at age 24 the sky’s the limit for the Chargers who expect big things from the offense with the addition of play-caller Kellen Moore. Week 1 matchup: vs. Miami Dolphins (9/10 3:25 PM CT) Greg Newsome II: CB Cleveland Browns Newsome the Chicago native is coming off the most productive of his two professional seasons. Along with teammate Denzel Ward Newsome will form one of the most skilled cornerback duos in the NFL and continue to prove that he was worthy of the Browns’ 26th overall pick from 2021.  He contributed six passes defended to a Browns defense whose 95 passes defended ranked fifth in the league with Newsome himself ranking behind only Ward Martin Emerson and Grant Delpit on his team. After battling injuries in his sophomore campaign Newsome needs a breakout campaign ahead of next offseason where the Browns will make a decision on his fifth-year option. There will be ample opportunities to make plays in Jim Schwartz’s new defense who comes in to replace Joe Woods at the helm of the defense. Week 1 matchup: vs. Cincinnati Bengals (9/10 12:00 PM CT) Injured Wildcats: DE Ifeadi Odenigbo (Jets) Other Wildcats in the NFL: OC Mike Kafka (Giants) CB Cam Mitchell (Browns) LB Anthony Walker (Browns) DE Earnest Brown IV (Rams) WR Ben Skowronek (Rams) Joe Gaziano (Falcons) DE Dean Lowry (Vikings) OL Blake Hance (Jaguars) RB Godwin Igwebuike (Falcons) WR Kyric McGowan (Commanders) QB Trevor Siemian (Bengals) LB Joe Jones (Free agent) \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story It is officially game week and Northwestern football is back after arguably the most turbulent offseason in the history of the program. With kickoff in Piscataway just six days away our staff embarks on its yearly tradition of predicting NU’s record. Needless to say the consensus is pretty gloomy. Comment below how you think the ‘Cats will do! Iggy Dowling: 3-9 (1-8 B1G) For anyone wondering the conference win comes against Rutgers. What would be more Northwestern than coming into Piscataway and winning fresh off the most turbulent offseason in the history of the program? Ultimately though it really doesn’t need to be said how much of a struggle this season should be. A 1-11 team lost four of its stars to the NFL and a slew of players to the portal... and that’s not even touching the month of July. If David Braun can muster together an on-field product that’s more respectable than 2022’s then I’d call this season a success and that’s no shot at anyone. Northwestern just doesn’t have the talent nor the depth to compete in the Big Ten right now. Maybe Ben Bryant works a miracle and maybe the team unity that some of the players have said stemmed from this summer manifests itself on the field but it seems like a massive longshot. Bradley Locker: 2-10 (0-9 B1G) This record prediction is about what I would have forecast even before everything that happened from July onward. Northwestern which won just one game a year ago (and hasn’t prevailed in America since Oct. 2021) loses four NFL Draft picks and more significant contributors through the transfer portal. This team should experience some slight positive regression — maybe because of more stability at quarterback or the jolt of an interim coach a phenomenon that seems to come true a decent amount — but still lacks the talent necessary to be competitive in a good Big Ten. I’m particularly concerned about the offensive and defensive lines which will be without Peter Skoronski Adetomiwa Adebawore and a slew more veterans. Wins against UTEP and Howard feel like the most likely despite NU’s woes against lower levels of competition last year. Maybe there’s a chance for upsets versus Rutgers Purdue and Nebraska but it will likely be another long season in Evanston a location which is now mired in controversy. David Gold: 4-8 (2-7 B1G) I’m taking the ‘Cats to defeat Rutgers UTEP Howard and Purdue. I would not be surprised if I have the highest win total for 2023 but even still I have low expectations to the Wildcats. After going 1-11 and losing six key players regression was likely. Add in a massive hazing scandal that saw a 17-year head coach canned just weeks before training camp and it is the perfect recipe for a disastrous season. Northwestern’s roster is weaker than it was a year ago but the only reason I have an increase in wins is the quarterback. I have a lot more faith in Ben Bryant who I assume will be the Week One starter to be halfway decent. NU had the third-most interceptions in the Power Five last season so the bar for No. 2 is on the floor. That is my motto for the Wildcats this season after a horrible 365 days both on and off the field: It can’t possibly get any worse. Right? John Ferrara: 3-9 (1-8 B1G) Give me wins against Rutgers UTEP and Howard though believing the ‘Cats can start 2-0 might be a bit optimistic on my end. Last year I fell victim to the post-Week Zero hype when a well-rounded win against Nebraska in Ireland was enough to rile up myself and the Twitter faithful into thinking NU wouldn’t be half-bad in 2022. Boy were we wrong in every way. I still am predicting a slight improvement on last season’s one-win outcome because I think Northwestern has added some difference makers at important positions (see: Ben Bryant A.J. Henning). More than that I’m a David Braun believer. The jump from the FCS to the FBS is no joke sure but Braun dominated at the subdivision level. His presser at Big Ten Media Days was enough to convince me he’ll be able to get his guys to buy in despite what adversity they’ve faced this off-season. Call me crazy but a two-win improvement could be in the cards. Ethan Segall: 3-9 (2-7 B1G) This team is incredibly difficult to project. Not only are we likely to see a first-time head coach and a new quarterback at the helm but the rest of the roster looks vastly different than last year. There are a few reasons to think the team is due to improve from last season’s one-win campaign (improved quarterback play and consistency health luck likely to be more favorable reasonable schedule). At the same time it’s fair to expect some growing pains with a new coach and the departure of a handful of NFL players. Ultimately I’m betting on the chaos of the Big Ten West projecting not just a win against Rutgers but also an upset against either Minnesota Nebraska or Maryland. Yes that does mean I’m projecting a loss to either UTEP or Howard which should not come as that much of a surprise after losses to Miami (OH) and Southern Illinois a season ago. Patrick Winograd 3-9 (1-8 B1G) When taking an initial look at Northwestern’s 2023 schedule I saw the potential for a four-win season if everything went right. And although four wins is nothing to write home about that would have been a three-win improvement from 2021. After everything unfolded over the course of the summer however I think this team might have too many distractions floating around it to get that far despite the potential impact from the newcomers (coaches and players alike). I probably like many others am still giving the ‘Cats two non-conference victories over UTEP and Howard.  In terms of the other game the ‘Cats take I think it is highly unlikely that Northwestern can pull off an upset in another team’s stadium but the ‘Cats also do not have a home game against one of the weaker Big Ten teams until their final home game against Purdue (unless you think Minnesota or Maryland are “weak” teams). Having said that Purdue won the Big Ten West last year so it is odd to think of it as a weak team. But both Wisconsin and Iowa are ranked in the AP preseason top 25 and with both Minnesota and Illinois in the others receiving votes category the projected bottom three of the Big Ten West (with this very odd justification) is Nebraska Purdue and Northwestern. Northwestern’s best chance to win a Big Ten game is against Purdue and I think the ‘Cats will pull it off and end the season at 3-9 with that lone conference victory. Adam Beck 3-9 (2-7 B1G) Taking into account all the NFL talent Northwestern lost in the offseason mixed with its schedule it’s no surprise to say the ‘Cats are going to struggle. Duke Penn State and Minnesota are all challenging games at the beginning of the season and closing out the year with the stretch of Iowa Wisconsin Purdue and Illinois isn’t much better. But sprinkled through the tough times there’s a path to three wins. It all starts with a Week One victory against Rutgers another Big Ten foe with low expectations for 2023. Winning back-to-back games to start the season off seems unlikely so let’s say the ‘Cats lose against UTEP at home but a game like Howard in the middle of the year should be a second tally in the win column. At the end of the day this is Big Ten football and in the cold crazy months to end the year anything is possible. With David Braun handling the reins Northwestern steals a win from somebody it probably shouldn’t like Nebraska Maryland or Purdue and fans of the purple and white go home happy after tripling their win total from a season ago. Brendan Preisman: 2-10 (0-9 B1G) Forget everything that happened after the calendar flipped to July. Take yourself back to early May about a week or so after the NFL Draft. In that draft Northwestern lost its best overall player its leading rusher (who also doubled as the team’s second-most prolific receiver) its best sack artist and fumble-causer and its best defensive back. It was the most picks Northwestern produced in a single draft since 1985. And if that wasn’t bad enough all that production departed from a team that lost to Southern Illinois and Miami at home. Now add that to the fact that David Braun has never coordinated — much less coached — a game at the FBS level and the fact that the team lost 11 players to the transfer portal and you’re left with a recipe for a struggle of a season. UTEP and Howard are probably the most likely wins but as we saw last year even non-power schools can come away with wins at Ryan Field. At least on the bright side 2-10 is (somehow) an improvement.  Jeremy Song: 3-9 (1-8 B1G) With four players lost to the 2022 NFL Draft and many transfers that have left the program one may think this new Northwestern team has been depleted of talent. However it’s also important to consider the new additions the most significant being Ben Bryant. With 2731 passing yards and a touchdown-to-interception ratio of 3:1 last season with Cincinnati the transfer is poised to take the reins of this offense and be the catalyst to improve the measly 13.75 points per game scored by the ‘Cats. I believe this will be enough to beat teams such as UTEP and Howard and might even lead to a surprising victory over Rutgers. However against the other nine Power Five teams I can’t envision a team that experienced so much turmoil in the offseason (coaching changes lost talent) outperforming these established teams. In my opinion wins over the two non-power opponents this season is a win in my books and a win over Rutgers or anybody else in the schedule would just be the cherry on top.  John Olsen: 0-12 (0-9 B1G) And it would be no less than what this program deserves. Natalie Wells 2-10 (0-9 B1G) Two wins are better than one right? The ‘Cats enter the 2023 season in a state of flux. After losing Peter Skoronski Evan Hull and others to the NFL offensive coordinator Mike Bajakian will oversee a completely revamped squad. Ben Bryant steps in at quarterback touting a 35-to-14 TD-INT ratio over his last two seasons at Eastern Michigan and Cincinnati. His presence will be a marked improvement over last year’s revolving door of signal-callers. Wide receiver A.J. Henning will be thrust into the spotlight after contributing primarily as a return man at Michigan. Interim head coach David Braun led North Dakota State’s defense to two FCS titles but can he survive the leap to both a new subdivision and leadership position? I think the ‘Cats steal wins against UTEP and Howard but the relative success stops there. Though it is their best chance to notch a B1G win it feels overly optimistic to predict a Week One victory at Rutgers considering the amount of turnover and overall chaos that characterized the offseason.     \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After a qualification for the 2022 NCAA Championships capped off Northwestern cross country’s best season in program history the team is just four days away from hitting the grass once again. While Jill Miller’s 2023 group will be without Rachel McCardell a two-time First Team All-Big Ten qualifier who broke five school records on the track during her five years in Evanston it has a number of rising stars primed to take that top spot. If they can step up in November Northwestern has a chance to do something it has never done: make back-to-back Nationals trips. Where does the team stand? You came to the right place: Lineup Overview Projected lineup: Kalea Bartolotto (Gr.) Ava Earl (Jr.) Anna Hightower (Jr.) Pippa Nuttall (Gr.) Katherine Hessler (Sr.) Adele Magaud (Gr.) Skye Ellis (So.) Key losses: Rachel McCardell Ari Marks Olivia Verbeke Key additions: Magaud (grad transfer from South Alabama) Nuttall (Georgetown) Rachel Sessa (UMass Lowell) Ella Behrens (WashU) Northwestern is set to return four of the seven members of its 2022 championship lineup and three of its top five runners. In comparison to the rest of the Big Ten that’s not awful. However many of the competitive teams that the ‘Cats beat to finish fifth in the conference and second in the Midwest Region — Penn State and Minnesota particularly — are returning even more production. Given that the four teams that finished above Northwestern at the conference meet are all well-positioned to compete for a Big Ten title and top-20 finishes in the country again it puts even more onus on NU’s returners to take a step forward. ""That’s what makes the additions of Adele Magaud and Pippa Nuttall extremely important. With Jill Miller at the helm Evanston seems like it’s becoming a more attractive destination for grad transfers than it’s ever been and that’s paid off in a huge way the past two years. In 2022 the key addition was Ari Marks who was the Division III individual runner-up in her final year at Wellesley. She became a key cog in Northwestern’s lineup earning a Midwest All-Region honor as the teams second-fastest runner to help the ‘Cats clinch their Nationals bid."" Now Northwestern has two additions who may not only break into its top seven but potentially its top five. Magaud finished 35th overall for South Alabama at the NCAA South Regional last year beating out multiple Alabama and Florida State runners who beat out a few NU athletes a week later in Stillwater Oklahoma. Nuttall who ran for Georgetown was often the eighth runner on a team that finished 2022 as the No. 10 group in the nation. Both should comfortably break 21 minutes in the 6K before the postseason comes around which would fit right into Northwestern’s lineup. That depth within the top seven is probably Northwestern’s biggest strength. It’s really hard to even tab someone as the definitive top runner because spots one-through-three (and three-through-six) seem almost interchangeable without considering how everyone fared in summer training. Kalea Bartolotto has the best 6K PR of everyone and hovered around the 20:30 mark multiple times last season but Hightower and Earl were close behind and could take significant jumps as rising juniors. Magaud Hessler and Nuttall could also step up as top-three runners if any member of that top trio has a rough day. That gives NU the ability to race in packs. Given that more than half of the lineup has experience in championship racing where positioning and tight one-to-five spreads mean everything that could prove to be crucial in late October and November. At the same time though Northwestern has to supplement that with a consistent elite scorer as the No. 1 piece in the lineup. What made the ‘Cats so dangerous last year is that in addition to having five runners who were all capable of stepping up as No. 2s or No. 3s when needed they had McCardell finish as team’s top scorer in every single race she ran in.  More importantly McCardell placed inside the top 10 in five of her six races with Nationals being the exception. Making up for her departure right out of the gate might be very tough to do. In championship season last year Bartolotto demonstrated that she’s capable of taking that role. She placed 11th at Big Tens and 15th at Regionals two weeks later. If she can emerge as an undisputed top 10 runner in the Midwest with a few others peaking at the right time to finish in the top 20 then Northwestern should finish as a top-two team in the region again and secure an auto-bid to Nationals. Schedule Overview Northwestern is set to race seven times this fall not including the National Championships.  As it did last year in Missouri — when it raced there in late September before heading back there for Regionals — the team will get an early-season shot at a course they’ll race at in the postseason: Wisconsin’s. The ‘Cats head up to Madison for the Big Ten Preview on Sept. 9 and the Big Ten Championships are also scheduled there on Oct. 27. The first meet should give NU a rough idea of where it stands in the conference as well as some areas of improvement it’ll need to emphasize in training to thrive on the course when it matters. ""The real early-season test though will be the Virginia Invitational out east on Sept. 16. Last year NU’s first big race was the Gans Creek Classic which came against a bunch of teams from the Midwest that the ‘Cats would compete against at Regionals a few weeks later. This should be a different animal. Eleven of last years 31 national qualifiers — and nine of 2022s top 17 teams — will race in Charlottesville that weekend. Because the NCAA will hold the 2023 title meet there this November a number of elite teams are taking advantage of a chance to get familiar with the hilly course."" This means a lot for Northwestern in a number of ways. Looking at the big picture it represents a shift in the program’s identity. Instead of setting a schedule geared toward becoming one of the better teams in its region that can occasionally qualify for the NCAAs NU is looking to improve on the national stage. Given the recruiting limitations of the school which doesn’t have a track and field program that’s unprecedented.  ""On a more technical level UVA’s Panorama Farms is one of the hilliest courses in the nation. For the ‘Cats who struggled on an absolutely grueling Oklahoma State course at the NCAA meet last year getting some early and high-pressure exposure to a tough course should strengthen them mentally and physically. Northwestern will return there for Nationals if it qualifies and guess where it has to finish top-two in the Midwest to do that? You guessed it Stillwater. Theres a decent chance Millers team will have to finish its season with two brutal courses as everyones season fatigue begins to seep in which makes it all the more important that NU faces some early adversity on the national level."" ""Itll be really interesting to see how the coaching staff balances that hill-heavy postseason with the goal of peaking during those races through their construction of the team’s training. After months of strength-based workouts to build fitness the typical late-season taper in mileage to prepare for these big races involves a heavy emphasis on speed workouts to feel fresh for competitions that are ideally the fastest of the season. While Northwestern will face stiff competition at its best there’s a really good chance that the times that come up on the clock won’t be PRs or even reflect how well most of the field races. "" ""It’s not like championship racing tends to be on flatter courses anyway but taking on two of the toughest ones in the United States at the end of the season after some easier courses in the middle of the season means that Northwestern will have to quickly adapt to a different style of racing in a high-pressure situation. Given NU doesnt have a ton of hills to work with in the Evanston area that could be a challenge compared to other schools. That being said it helps that most of the lineup now has experience with racing all the way up to Thanksgiving."" So where does Northwestern stand? ""The U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Associations rankings are set to come out on Tuesday and Northwestern should be one of the top 30 teams. This team doesnt appear to have a ton of starpower but its depth near the back end of its top five will probably end up being a decisive strength."" ""However there are a ton of obstacles that could prevent the Cats from earning their second straight NCAA appearance. With the middle of the Big Ten having lost less than Northwestern and the traditional strength of the Mountain and Great Lakes Regions compared to the Midwest an at-large bid is going to be hard to come by for NU. Even without superstar Natalie Cook who transferred to Colorado Oklahoma State should easily take first at its home course. That means the Wildcats will almost certainly have to finish second in the Midwest Regional to go to Charlottesville. "" ""Looking at their competition third-place Bradley lost its top three runners to national runner-up New Mexico after former Braves coach Darren Gauson took the job there. The real threat will be Minnesota which finished fifth in the region in a rebuilding year after it lost superstars Bethany and Megan Hasz to the pros. Now the Gophers will have the reigning Big Ten Cross Country Freshman of the Year at the top in Ali Weimer to lead five other returning runners. With Utah transfer Lauren Peterson also in the fold UMN should give the Cats a run for their money. Iowa State which will return all seven of its 2022 Regional scorers (and two top-10 finishers) should also be dangerous."" ""None of these teams will race in Stillwater before Regionals which makes this even more intriguing. NU will go toe-to-toe with both Minnesota and ISU (the Gophers at the Big Ten Preview and the conference meet the Cyclones at the Virginia Invitational) so well get a better sense of where the Cats stand among that trio."" ""Iowa State relied on its top-end talent last season while Minnesotas middle of the lineup packed together and kicked well to score points. Ultimately Northwestern will have to do both of these things to make up for the fact that its losing much more production than both of these teams. It sounds like an obvious strategy but getting everything to click for one race is much easier said than done."" Regardless I think Earl and Hightower can surprise a lot of people by virtue of having a ton of room to grow as rising juniors who have already succeeded in big-time races. Either of them could form a strong one-two punch with Bartolotto and contend for an All-Big Ten (top 14) finish in Madison. If that happens and the grad transfers can consistently race well at the back end of the lineup with a big race or two in the postseason then I think Northwestern can match its magical 2022 season. After all this team has one of the sport’s best coaches and has already done something no one thought was possible.

Share this story After an offseason no one will ever forget the beginning of the 2023 season — the first without Pat Fitzgerald as head coach since 2005 — has arrived for Northwestern football. Ahead of the Wildcats’ clash in Piscataway New Jersey with the Rutgers Scarlet Knights interim head coach David Braun spoke to the media Monday afternoon. Opening statement: “Well we’re here. Game week. I know our staff I know this team is really excited to embark on this. We got into rhythm and routine last week. This will be a full week of prep. Our guys have today off; we’ll be back at it tomorrow and then get into our weekly progression. Know that we have quite a task on our hands. Having the chance to look at Rutgers over the course of the last few months and having an opportunity to just observe what Coach Schiano has done over the years we know that we’re going to deal with a team that’s well-prepared well-coached very fundamentally sound. We’ll play a physical brand of football that certainly fits Big Ten football well. Opportunity for this team to go on the road and really see where we’re at. Very confident in the way that our guys have navigated fall camp. “This past Saturday was a great opportunity for us to get back over to Ryan Field and really get into a gameday rhythm and routine — for a young football team for a football staff that has a lot of newcomers including myself. Just to get into that gameday routine and what that looks like from a warmup standpoint in and out of the locker room what halftime looks like I know was really beneficial to our group. “You can sense the level of anticipation excitement of where this team is at. We have a confident football team right now. I think a group that understands that there’s some really outstanding veteran leadership complemented with a lot of youthful talent. There’s no doubt that myself and the rest of this group is excited to compete against someone else other than their own teammates and to do it in a Big Ten format on a Sunday with a lot of eyes on us. An opportunity for this group to really start writing their own story is something that all of us are really looking forward to.” On the team’s starting quarterback: “We’ve made that decision. We’re keeping that decision in-house right now.” On the Saturday scrimmage: “It was very mock game-ish. Everything we were doing were scout looks. An opportunity for us to continue to prepare for Rutgers. My takeaways were No. 1 this group has been on a slow build and they’re amping up to that point where you can tell they’re ready to play. The other takeaways from it were just really have seen this group overall mature throughout fall camp. You can just tell in terms of the way that the offense is operating the way the defense is operating some of the quirks that we maybe had to work out from the first live scrimmage have started to work themselves out. You can tell that we have a focused group right now.” On naming captains: “We have held a vote for it. We have not announced those names yet but that’s something we plan on doing this week. Excited to announce those names. Not only excited about the results of those but also just really impressed by the number of young men that were voted for by their teammates. I think it reflects not just a small group of leadership; there’s leadership throughout our locker room right now that has been absolutely necessary as we’ve navigated late July and into August.” On the team’s RB room: “Cam Porter is gosh he’s awesome. Just his maturity and the way that he carries himself in that room. Tre Tyus III continues continues to step up. Just a big back that as he gets more reps and creates more confidence certainly going to be what you would want out of a traditional Big Ten back and provide some depth at that position. Joe Himon II continues to just really impress me. I’m only coming from a perspective of someone that’s looking at it from a defensive lens. Just has an explosive quality that we’re really excited about. Jake Arthurs just continues to impress. Local kid that’s done everything that we’ve ever asked of him; incredibly reliable. Someone that we’ll lean on a ton this year. Caleb Komolafe is a young man true freshman that we’ll see what his role looks like moving forward. Don’t know exactly what that role looks like. Not sure if he’s going to redshirt or not but as a true freshman someone in that room that has definitely turned some heads as we’ve gone through fall camp.” On players playing special teams: “All of them are going to be prepared to specifically Caleb [Komolafe] has positioned himself to be someone to be considered. We’ve kind of got to weigh those options as a true freshman. All those guys that we mentioned have taken reps whether it be in individual drills in special teams or specific scheme. One thing that we’ve identified as a staff considering our current situation and roster numbers: everyone is going to have to play a critical role. “One thing our guys understand: your effort on special teams in my opinion — having been a special teams coordinator before — is the ultimate reflection about how much you truly care about the team. No one comes into Northwestern saying ‘Hey I want to be the starting right guard on punt!’ The effort and intentionality and preparation that you put into those special teams direct reflection about how much you care about the team. All of the young men that sit in this team meeting room have dreams and aspirations of playing football beyond their college years. There’s no better way to create value on an NFL roster early on than to show your value on special teams. There’s no doubt in my mind that our team understands the value not only for this team but also the value for them moving forward individually.” On knowing that his team’s prepared: “I think it’s a good question. I think you just get a sense from our team from our staff: they’re just ready. They’re just ready. They’ve galvanized; they’ve come together. Leadership has stepped up. They’re ready to go compete. You can feel that in the building. There’s no doubt about that. “I think it’s a group that’s coming off a 1-10 season. A group that certainly has had to navigate a unique time. A group that’s hungry to put on full display what they know they stand of in terms of just the resilience continuity togetherness that they’ve displayed these last few weeks.” On readying for his first game as a head coach: “That’s a great question. I think the element that I bring to this role I’m not going to say it’s unique. It’s just I know who I am. I am extremely confident in my ability to lead to inspire to meet people where they’re at to pull people together for common purpose. I also believe I have a unique ability to identify the things that I don’t know or don’t understand and wholeheartedly admit that I don’t and seek wisdom and expertise to help me navigate that. Some of that’s going on right now with ‘How am I going to manage a game while still calling a defense? Who am I leaning on? How much are we leaning into analytics?’ All these things that are going on. I think Step One not having experience doing that not having experience doing that at the Big Ten at the Power Five level — Step One in identifying I said ‘I need help here.’ I think I have a personality that allows me to do that and seek out that wisdom. “Very confident in my ability to lead this team. I know I’ve been put in this position for a reason. I’m confident that I’m up to the task up to the challenge. I’m up to it because there’s incredible people around me. Our players our staff support outside the program that I’ve been able to lean on mentors people that are willing to pick up a phone call. ‘Hey I really need to pick your brain.’ There’s so many thank yous that I owe throughout this whole process — I’ll continue to owe as we go throughout the season. I know I’m up to the challenge but I’m up to the challenge because I’ve got great people around me and I’ve been willing to lean into that.” On communication: “I think with the team specifically transparency is key. Just being genuine who you are is absolutely critical. That’s how you build up credibility. A lot of people want to throw around the word ‘trust’; you can’t demand trust. That’s something that you build through your actions. I hope that anyone that’s interacted with me since I’ve arrived at Northwestern would say that I’ve tried to do my best in both those worlds — of just being as transparent as I possibly can be and just truly being myself. I think that’s what I’ve learned with opportunities to connect with media some of which I’m close with have known previously others that I’m meeting for the first time. Just speak with passion; speak from the heart. Be true to who I am. Regardless of how other people interpret that at least I can walk away from that interaction knowing that I was being myself.” On players not speaking to media Monday and fielding allegations-related questions: “My policy on that is we’re less than a week away from our first football game. I’m here to talk about football. Our players are ready to talk about football. That’s what we’re going to focus on. “Our players are going to be available based on requests and merit of their performance on the field. Our players are ready to focus on football so that’s what we’re going to focus on. “Our players have been available. We’re focused on Rutgers and moving forward into game week to make sure that we stay focused on Rutgers I felt like it was an opportunity for me to speak on that and allow them to focus on the gameplan.” On what factors led to determining a starting QB: “It was a difficult one. There’s a ton of depth in that room right now. Ryan Hilinski has a ton of experience at this level. Brendan Sullivan started multiple games for us last year; has performed really well. Ben Bryant as a transfer navigated an interesting circumstance only arriving here in June. Jack Lausch is a young man that has shown flashes of being someone that as a program we’ve got to find ways to get on the field. Really excited about the depth in that room. It was not an easy decision. Very confident that there is depth in that room; we will continue to lean into that depth. This program and this locker room is hungry for a starting quarterback and someone that everyone can look to and say ‘That’s our starting quarterback. That’s who’s going to lead us to victories.’ We’ve made that decision but just choosing to keep that information in-house at this time.” On the impact of quarterback mobility in Mike Bajakian’s playbook: “Just observing it from a practice standpoint tremendous amount of respect for Mike. He’s done it at a high level multiple places. There’s no doubt that the element of a dual-threat quarterback finds ways to stress a defensive playcaller. There’s no doubt about that. I think it limits the looks you see coverage-wise especially on first and second down because people are saying ‘How willing are we really to play single-high defense against an element of quarterback run? How much are we willing to play back-to-the-ball defense man coverage if this guy can scramble on a consistent basis?’ “There’s certainly elements to that but there’s also a true pocket passer that can be efficient with quick game screens RPOs and dropback pass — that’s a weapon in and of itself. Mike’s going to find ways regardless of if he’s got a pocket passer or dual-threat back there. Great coaches find to lean into the strengths of their players and I’m confident that Mike will do just that as we navigate this season.” On what fuels team motivation: “Brotherhood. There’s a bunch of guys right now that they’ve come together; they’ve leaned into one another; they’ve pushed one another through offseason workouts fall camp; they’ve seen some of their teammates go through some things personally in their personal lives and their family lives outside of football that have been incredibly difficult to navigate. They’ve seen injuries that have occurred — which are inevitable in the game of football — but helping guys navigate through that process. If you were to talk to our football team specifically our leadership right now and just describe to us one thing that drives this group right now I think unanimously — I don’t want to speak for them but I think a very common answer would be the brotherhood and camaraderie in the guys that have come together in that locker room.” On playing freshmen: “I think it stems to some of the things that we’ve done in terms of our fall camp model. We’ve found ways to try and double-rep some of our team run to find ways to make sure that our 3s are getting opportunities. With our roster number where it was at maybe those double reps weren’t as numbered initially as I may have liked because we were managing that balance of straining through fall camp but also keeping our health. Those reps add up. “That was intentional in its design because at some point we’re going to have to lean on a freshman to go play a ton of football for us this year. We’re going to have to lean on a young man that is a 3 right now but all of a sudden it’s Week Seven and he’s going to be starting for us. The fact that that young man has accumulated reps and built trust with his teammates there’s going to be a bunch of guys out there that can look to him and say ‘Hey he’s got this.’ And he’s going to be able to look at his teammates and say ‘You know what that’s what all these banked reps are for.’ It’s going to have to be a ‘next man up’ mentality. We can’t be in a mode of excuses or explanations. We’ve got to be in the business of being solutions-based. Who’s going to be our best next option moving forward? At times this season that’s going to involve some young guys. That’s okay. We’re excited for those guys to shine when they get their opportunity.” On coaches that have reached out to him: “I’ve been so impressed with the Big Ten coaches. Whether it be at Media Day in person — which it was only half the group that day; they split it up into two days — but just a quick hello or just Coach Schiano in a waiting room taking five minutes to check in on me and everyone. Text messages phone calls. It’s a special group. They may not understand what I’m navigating but they’ve certainly done their best to show their support. That’s something I know myself our staff my family really appreciate.” On if he’s talked with Pat Fitzgerald: “I’m focused on running this program and running this program right now is the people that are in this building day in and day out.” On gameplanning for a Scarlet Knight offense led by a new OC: “It has been a challenge. You’re meshing the current personnel at Rutgers which certainly has its strengths. Been impressed with positions and some of the transfers that they brought in. Okay let’s find film on meshing all those pieces together on top of a new scheme coming from Minnesota. What I can say is Coach Ciarrocca he’s done a tremendous job over a long period of time. Certainly knows what he’s doing. Knows how to attack defenses. We are certainly very aware as a defensive staff of the task that we have on hand for us. “We can study past years last year at Minnesota his time at Penn State — we can go back as far as we want. We know that he’s going to find some new things to dress up and give us some different looks. As a defensive staff and a defensive side of the ball we’re going to have to do a tremendous job of identifying what looks we’re getting early in the game and being willing to make adjustments as we go. That process started back in May; that process has continued. We certainly have a great awareness especially with our defensive staff that has a lot of Big Ten experience of the level of coaching that’s going on and the task that we’re going to have on Sunday.”       \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story It’s been just over a calendar year since the last time Northwestern won a football game. It’s been even longer than that since they won a game on American soil. But the ‘Cats will take the field with a chance to break the losing streak this Sunday at Rutgers in the first game of the 2023 season.  The glass-half-full attitude? New quarterback Ben Bryant offers a glimmer of hope for Northwestern fans potentially giving interim head coach David Braun a passer who can actually sling it at a high level. Nobody’s certain of anything but Bryant should at least be better than Ryan Hilinski or Brendan Sullivan were last year. He hasn’t officially been announced as the starter but it would be a surprise to see anyone else line up under center on Sunday. The glass-half-empty attitude? Northwestern is probably a pretty bad team. It’s hard to ignore the holes on the roster especially up front after the departure of key lineman on both sides of the ball. The weapons are all unproven and there’s totally a world in which nobody emerges as a big threat to opposing defenses. We’ll start to get a sense for just how successful this team can be on Sunday against the Scarlet Knights. Here’s three matchups to watch when the ‘Cats take the field. Kirk Ciarrocca’s new offense vs. David Braun’s new defense Both teams have had some turnover in their coaching ranks this offseason. The ‘Cats’ defensive philosophy will be dictated by David Braun the interim head coach who was initially hired to be the new defensive coordinator. Braun was the defensive coordinator at North Dakota State for three years prior to this opportunity. Before that he bounced around as a position coach for about 10 years. Braun’s defensive unit will be going up against a Rutgers offense that is also under new management. Kirk Ciarrocca has taken over as Rutgers’ offensive coordinator for 2023 after a year of serving as the OC at Minnesota. The coach is in his second stint at Rutgers having worked as a co-OC for the program from 2008-2010. Both units are suspect. Braun’s defense simply lacks talent and upside. The line is young and unproven against Big Ten-level competition. The secondary features guys like Garnett Hollis Jr. who you think could be good but also will likely be a major step down from Cam Mitchell and A.J. Hampton. Similarly Ciarrocca’s offense lacks firepower and it will be heavily reliant on the run game coming to life. Because the two units are similarly uninspiring this matchup may very well be a coaching battle between the two new coaches. A.J. Henning Cam Johnson and Bryce Kirtz vs. the Rutgers secondary The Scarlet Knights have a promising group in the secondary this season that projects to be one of the team’s strengths. Robert Longerbeam and Max Melton return at corner for their junior years. Both had two interceptions in 2022 but will not have to contend with current Jacksonville Jaguar Christian Braswell for snaps this season.  At safety the team’s fifth-leading tackler from 2022 — Desmond Igbinosun — returns for his junior campaign alongside senior transfer Flip Dixon from Minnesota. There isn’t an obvious weakness in this group so it seems safe to expect the Rutgers secondary to be serviceable. Northwestern’s receivers on the other hand are incredibly difficult to predict. Henning and Johnson are both transferring in from other Power Five schools where they didn’t get enough playing time to show their full capacity. But that also means that both of them are toss-ups as to whether they actually perform at Northwestern. Kirtz’s improvement between last year and this year also remains to be seen. If he’s the same player he was in 2022 that won’t be good enough against this formidable Rutgers secondary. JaQuae Jackson vs. Northwestern corners Jackson is a fascinating target for Gavin Wimsatt and the Rutgers offense. It isn’t often you see a guy transfer to a Division I program from a Division II program and immediately have a shot at claiming the top wide receiver slot. But that’s exactly what’s happening at Rutgers with Jackson. The senior racked up 1178 yards and 13 touchdowns last season at PennWest California and was a Division II All-American. Obviously a promotion to the Big Ten means significantly more talented defenders will be covering Jackson this season but NU’s corners seem like they might provide him with a soft landing in the conference. Hollis Jr. is long and rangy but we haven’t seen him in a full-time role yet. It’s unclear what his ceiling is. Theran Johnson is similarly unproven and the group doesn’t have significant depth to fall back on. Jackson is an interesting story to watch out for this season and he has a chance to do big things Week One. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After an underwhelming 2022 season Russell Payne’s ‘Cats have kicked their way back into rhythm. Let’s talk about everything clicking through two games into the new campaign. Aug. 24 vs St. Thomas Looking to win their season opener for the first time in half a decade the ‘Cats set their sights on the Tommies. Initially meant to be played at Martin Stadium the game was moved inside to Ryan Fieldhouse a day before due to extreme heat. But the only heat felt through the first 45 minutes was the scrappy play between the two sides. Northwestern and St. Thomas combined for 21 fouls and three yellow cards in the first half. Even with the game remaining scoreless through 45 minutes NU held the statistical upper hand tallying three shots and four corners compared to zero in both categories for St. Thomas. Out of the break Northwestern capitalized first with forward Christopher Thaggard cashing  in just 82 seconds into the half. The sophomore noticed the Tommies’ defender sleeping with the ball took it from him and finished the play off with his left foot for his second career goal.  Yet 10 minutes later St. Thomas found an equalizer courtesy of Dutch midfielder Oliver Bieleveldt. The Tommies’ lone shot on goal in the match Bieleveldt pounced on a disorganized set piece opportunistically leveling the game at one. With the match deadlocked at one heading into the final stretch Northwestern continued its search for the go-ahead goal. With about 60 seconds left Northwestern’s last opportunity came in the form of a corner. Defender Ibrahim Obeid curled one into the mixer finding the head of first-year midfielder Peter Riesz whose header knocked the ball over to defender Nigel Prince. In a swarm of purple and gray jerseys near the penalty spot Prince’s effort fell perfectly onto the left foot of Justin Weiss who — in front of the outstretched arms of the Tommies’ goalkeeper — smashed a volley home lifting the ‘Cats to victory with 42 seconds left. Last minute game-winning goal.  Say that five times fast @NUMensSoccer fans.  \u200d  pic.twitter.com/Y6QJ8fOygn A true down to the wire nail-biter Weiss’ game-winner not only gave the ‘Cats a great way to start the season but excellent momentum heading into their next matchup against NJIT. Aug. 27 vs NJIT Riding high off the win Northwestern looked to keep the mojo going against the Highlanders. Its first ever match-up against NJIT the game also marked the first time the ‘Cats have ever played a team from the America East Conference. Unlike the game against St. Thomas Northwestern found its spark in the first half — just 25 minutes into play — courtesy of senior Rom Brown’s fourth career goal. Brown started the play in the middle of the park spraying an outside-the-foot pass behind the Highlanders’ defense to a cutting Weiss. The hero from the home opener caught up to the pass on the goal line and patiently waited for Brown to cut down the middle of the NJIT defense. When Brown made his run to the front of the six-yard box Weiss played a crisp ball to Brown’s right foot allowing the Israeli midfielder to one-touch a shot past the goalkeeper’s right foot. ""25 | GOAL! Rom Brown finds the breakthrough! pic.twitter.com/9RzO9f1utK"" Retaining the one goal cushion into the break Northwestern encountered a tighter more physical game in the second half. Referee Christopher Koloffon pulled his yellow card out six times in the second frame as Northwestern hung onto its lead. But in the end the ‘Cats had answers for the Highlanders emerging victorious for another win on the young season.  Northwestern ended the game with eight shots (four on goal) compared to NJIT’s seven (two on goal) while the Highlanders tallied more saves (3 to 2) corners (5 to 4) and fouls (18 to 12) than the ‘Cats.  Looking Ahead With 14 fresh faces new to Evanston and only 55.7% of the team’s total minutes played last year returning this team looks very different than its 2022 edition. But in coach Payne’s third season in charge things could not have started better in Evanston.  Led by Weiss’ goal against St. Thomas and his assist against NJIT the ‘Cats are in a position to start the season off 3-0-0 for the first time since 2008 when Northwestern opened the season with wins against San Francisco IUPUI and Iona. Up next the ‘Cats will hit the road traveling up north to take on Milwaukee on Sep. 1. Then they’ll continuing their stretch of away games with a Chicagoland clash against DePaul on Sep. 4. Northwestern is 3-14-2 all-time against Milwaukee with its last date against the Panthers ending in a 1-1 draw last season at Martin Stadium. Against DePaul the ‘Cats have fared better leading the all-time series 19-10-3 with the teams’ last matchup in 2021 ending in a 2-0 NU win. After a fiery start at home Northwestern will look to keep the winning feeling going with its first road trip on the horizon. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story My apologies in advance if I’m a little out of breath for this update. It’s just that Northwestern women’s soccer team has scored 10 goals in its last two games. Do the ‘Cats not stop to think of the toll that sort of production can have on fans? My heart can only tolerate so much excitement! And head coach Michael Moynihan earned his 300th career win? I’m starting to get woozy! Let’s get on with this recap while I’m still able to write it. Aug. 24 vs. Oakland After going scoreless against Kansas State Northwestern knew it had goals in the tank. Unfortunately for the Golden Grizzlies the ‘Cats unleashed against them. The Thursday night matchup was an onslaught by the Northwestern offense and a Josie Aulicino hat-trick paved the way to a 7-0 victory. The powers-that-be pushed the game’s start time from 7:30 to 8:00 p.m. citing excessive heat but I think it was so that the snazzy new Gothic kits could get their proper nighttime shine.  pic.twitter.com/wI5LQZnKnp I mean look at those. They scream “look good play good” and these jerseys certainly cover the ‘look good’ component. In their 90 minutes on the field the players took care of the other half of the adage. Emma “Master of the Skies” Phillips opened the scoring swooping in toward the back post to head home a Meg Boade cross. .@megboade  ➡️ @emmanphillips_ ➡️   pic.twitter.com/qtABLWlfST This clinical link up put the Wildcats up 1-0 which held until the break. That means that there were six goals scored in the second half. Oh to be a fly on the wall for Moynihan’s half time speech... It was no holds barred once the ‘Cats retook the field. In the 53rd minute Ella Hase scored. In the 55th minute Aulicino scored. In the 63rd minute Aurea del Carmen scored. In the 66th minute Aulicino scored again. In the 69th minute Aulicino scored again (again). In the 72nd minute — last but not least — Bridget Mitchell scored. *phew*  All in all the ‘Cats scored seven goals on 21 shots (12 on goal). Eight different players contributed to the scoring with nine assists handed out on the seven goals. One of those assists came from first-year Megan Norkett the first of her career. Aulicino (3) Boade (2) and Falls (2) all had multi-dish games and del Carmen joined Aulicino as the only players with at least one goal and one assist. Aulicino (I hope y’all aren’t tired of hearing her name yet; it’ll be a long season if you are) also completed the elusive double hat trick totaling 9 points in the contest. Her hat trick was just the seventh in program history. Defensively the game was a little more boring. Oakland managed only one shot the entire game and it wasn’t even on target. It’s no wonder that Phillips got in on the scoring; It’s not like she had much else to do. This shutout was Northwestern’s third of the season. The final note from this dominant win comes from the touchline. With this victory Moynihan reached 300 career wins 107 of those coming at NU. It’s fitting that it was also the largest victory in his Northwestern career. Scoring seven goals would make any team a little weary but there was no time to rest. It was on to Toledo for the ‘Cats. Aug. 27 at Toledo Northwestern may need to increase funding to its aerospace program because this matchup was the first time a Wildcat ever faced a Rocket. The ‘Cats took care of their astro-foes with ease taking Toledo down 3-1. The first goal of the match came from someone who somewhat surprisingly had not found the scoresheet through a handful of games. Caterina Regazzoni secured her first goal of the season by converting on a ball from Aulicino marking what could be the first of many for the reigning Big Ten Freshman of the Year. Three minutes later in the 44th minute another new name was marked down in the scorebook. Jaelyn Eisenhart the transfer from USC sent home Boade’s service tilting it to 2-0 in favor of the Wildcats heading into the half. After the break Ingrid Falls decided to add one for good measure. She took a hint from her opponents and rocketed one from just outside the box into the back of the net. Aulicino was credited for an assist but watching the clip will show that Falls did the heavy lifting. Close out your Monday with this unstoppable strike from Ingrid Falls   pic.twitter.com/nkTTAWDKq5 In garbage time (or as the professionals like to call it the 85th minute) Toledo’s Madison Medalle had to draw a penalty and play spoiler to Northwestern’s 354-minute shutout streak. That Toledo goal was too little too late and when the final whistle blew the ‘Cats secured their third win of the season While the Wildcats remain undefeated there are some parties that would like to see a little bit more. After ranking Northwestern No. 18 in the preseason poll the United Soccer Coaches decided to drop the ‘Cats from the rankings following Week One. This 10-goal second week might change their minds. Moving Forward Regardless of what the polls say Northwestern still has business to conduct on the pitch. Next up on the ledger: Boston University. The Evanston forecast isn’t showing any rain but there will still be ‘Cats and dogs all over the field on Thursday as the Terriers come to town to take on the Wildcats. The matchup is set for 7 p.m. CT on Aug. 31. After BU the ‘Cats will be back on the road this time making their way down to a familiar foe — one affectionately known as the “Northwestern of the South.” There could be some bad blood in this matchup between the Wildcats and the Vanderbilt Commodores. Northwestern did knock them out of the NCAA Tournament last season after all.

Share this story Well we have finally made it.  After nine months it is officially game week with Northwestern heading to Piscataway New Jersey to take on the Rutgers Scarlet Knights. For 130 FBS teams Week One springs optimism that this will be the year an empty canvas waiting to be painted of their 2023 season. For the Wildcats it usually feels similar to its other FBS schools; however as the 2023 season commences this season already feels lost for Northwestern before it has even taken a snap.  Let’s face the elephant in the room: for the first time this century Pat Fitzgerald will not be roaming around the Wildcats’ sideline. After 17 years at the helm arguably the best player and winningest coach in NU’s history was unceremoniously fired just weeks before fall camp began due to allegations of sexual hazing inside the program. I know these allegations have been talked about over and over again but every time I think of them I can’t help but feel a churning in my stomach. 18-year-old kids who were told that they would be coached and developed into successful young men found themselves being restrained and dry humped by their teammates and “friends.” Compile on the other allegations of coerced naked activity and the “car wash” it becomes clear that Northwestern’s culture was broken.  Fitz fell on the sword but it is apparent that there were many others culpable who are still employed by the university for the behavior inside Northwestern football. For Fitzgerald a former president of the AFCA and highly respected among everyone in college football it is a fall from grace that no one could have expected. And for ‘Cats fans it hung a dark cloud over a program so many love. After finding out that Fitz had been fired I found myself sitting alone for the next few hours. I was speechless and dumbfounded. How could someone I admired that much have it end like this? When I visited Northwestern looking to transfer one of the places I made sure to stop by was the football office. As someone who has coached football and still wants to coach in the football there was no one I respected and looked up to more than Fitz. To see the success of Northwestern football in spite of all the academic standards the program had to navigate was something I found incredibly remarkable. I originally thought I was gonna spend my time at Northwestern breaking down film for NUFB because I wanted to learn how to be a coach from Pat Fitzgerald so to see him leave Northwestern under these circumstances hurt me. I found myself thinking If I had only been around for a year and felt this way I cannot imagine the grief longtime Wildcats fans are feeling. For the longtime ‘Cats fans many of which read our site often the response to Fitz’s termination has been loud on both sides. Many believe that he was wronged and the media is to blame for his ousting; others are hurt that the program they knew and loved was not what it appeared to be. It does not get easier that the allegations came out in July forcing NU to quickly pivot to get ready for the upcoming season. David Braun took the reins of the program but the aura of Fitzgerald and the hazing allegations during his tenure still lingers inside the Walter Athletics Center. Since I’ve first interacted with Braun he has been nothing but authentic. At the team’s Pro Day this year Braun — who had not even officially met with the media yet — spent half an hour talking with me and getting to know me. I remember his smile when he was talking about his boys trying deep dish pizza for the first time before a Giordano’s vs Lou Malnati’s debate broke out. At Big Ten Media Day thrust into the spotlight he handled each tough question with poise and dignity. To send the newly appointed interim head coach in front of the media even though President Michael Schill and athletic director Derrick Gragg had not answered a single question was unfair to Braun. But he still displayed his ability to steady the ship in 2023. I hope that at the end of this season I can write a piece on why Braun deserves to have the interim tag removed — but the program has to show much improvement both on and off the field before we can begin to have that discussion. All of this brings us to opening weekend. Whether you are watching it on TV in the stands of SHI Stadium or in the press box it will be weird to watch Northwestern come out of the locker room without Pat Fitzgerald. However 103 players wearing the “N” on their helmets will jog onto the sideline. Many of those players were in the locker room last season when hazing was still occurring a whistleblower told The Daily Northwestern. It is not as if the head coach was the lone individual at fault here; the hazing was player-led onto their teammates. It is highly likely that players taking the field on Sunday for the Wildcats have either been hazed hazed or more likely been on both ends of the spectrum. How do you fix a problem when the problem is still inside the locker room? It does not get solved when players and coaches are wearing “‘Cats against the World” shirts with No. 51 on them because it implies that they didn’t see anything wrong with the hazing that occurred. I’ve seen plenty of debate online on how Northwestern students alumni and fans should approach the 2023 season. On one hand supporting these student-athletes and getting excited for another year of Big Ten football makes perfect sense. Theoretically it should not matter who is at the helm of the program or which individuals are on the field because fans are rooting for the name across the chest. All of that is unrealistic. For many Fitz made people excited about NUFB and seeing him fired so unceremoniously made them drop their fandom all together. For others they struggle to support a group accused of these actions. All of those responses are warranted. There is no right way to feel about Northwestern football as everyone is still grieving in their own way. Only one thing is certain though: when the Wildcats kick off their season on Sunday afternoon it is a new era for NU. It is one that no one expected but it is the situation at hand. Normally a new era brings hope for a brighter future but right now there is a dark cloud surrounding NUFB. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Reader I want you to take a journey with me. Imagine a walk along the Lakefill on Northwestern’s campus or maybe down one of the beaches on Lakeshore Drive. You’ve just had some delicious Chicago-style pizza the Cubs just beat the Pirates to take the lead in the NL Central and the temperature remains in the 70s despite the sun beginning to set. In short everything is going right for you and everyone else in the Chicagoland area. What does that mean for Northwestern football? A year ago I would have said something like an 8-4 record and Big Ten West contention. Three months ago I would have said a trip to a bowl game this season would be an unmitigated success. But after all the chaos of this summer I think I’ve come up with an answer. The best possible success for Northwestern football would be a return to normalcy.  But what does normalcy look like for Northwestern football? Exactly 375 days ago Daniel Olinger published a story on this website detailing what “normal” used to be for Northwestern. In that story he noted that under Fitzgerald Northwestern was always winning but never winning big. The mark of 7.5 wins per year from 2007 to 2017 was stellar for a program with a history as thin as Northwestern’s but certainly not good enough for contention in the Big Ten. Then 2018 hit and everything went topsy-turvy. Since 2017 a wildly impressive 10-3 run Northwestern’s year-by-year results have been a roller coaster. In 2018 Northwestern won the Big Ten West for the first time in program history. In 2019 the ‘Cats went 3-9. In 2020 Northwestern won the Big Ten West for the second time in program history. In 2021 the ‘Cats went 3-9. Of course that meant 2022 would be another division title right? Extremely wrong. Just two of our staffers predicted a winning record and even their predictions were filled to the brim with either blind optimism or outright confusion. In the end the duo was too optimistic. There’s no point in re-opening the old wounds of the 2022 season so I won’t do that here. What I will say is that even if you ignore the hazing scandal Northwestern lost its four best players to the NFL Draft and another 11 players to the transfer portal. And all that production departed from a team that lost to an FCS squad at home.  This year our staff did not drink the Kool-Aid whatsoever. Not a single staffer projected a winning record and just one predicted that Northwestern would win more than three times this fall. Admittedly this is an extremely bleak outlook on the season. But the up-and-down of the late 2010s simply wasn’t sustainable. Especially with a new coach what’s really needed is consistency and meeting expectations. Luckily for this year’s team those expectations are basically nonexistent. According to ESPN Northwestern is a 6.5-point underdog at Rutgers this Sunday and while the odds for the whole season haven’t been released yet it’s safe to say Northwestern will be favored in just two. Those games both home affairs against UTEP and Howard are by far the easiest games on the schedule. UTEP is a bottom 25 team in basically every major metric and Howard is an FCS team. Admittedly Northwestern has shown its problems with both FCS and non-power schools even when the games are at Ryan Field. But remember everything’s going right for the Chicago area in this journey so that means Northwestern wins both. Other than that...it’s not ideal. The two games Northwestern is most likely to win outside of the aforementioned contests are Rutgers and Purdue. The Wildcats could win both of those games — all it would take is whoever the starting quarterback is (hopefully Ben Bryant) to outduel an anemic Rutgers offense and a retooling ‘Cats defense forcing Purdue transfer Hudson Card into a few mistakes. Aside from those four games though it’s difficult to project a win mainly because of how tough this schedule is. According to KFORD Ratings Northwestern is facing the fourth-toughest slate of opposing defenses this year. That includes matchups with No. 10 Minnesota No. 5 Penn State No. 1 Iowa and No. 6 Illinois. As you can also see on that graphic there’s a 64% chance Northwestern wins four or more games. Anything after that is a long shot especially with Northwestern likely being double-digit underdogs in seven games. They are probably the worst team in the conference and if they can’t beat Purdue at home they’ll almost certainly finish at the bottom of the Big Ten West for the third consecutive season. However this season isn’t about wins and losses. It stopped being about that in July when the hazing scandal broke. This team could go 0-12 and it would not matter. This team could go 6-6 and it would not matter. The goal this year is fixing the soul of this program which had its wounds revealed after the revelations of this summer. Those wounds dated from well before the roller coaster ride began in 2018.  David Braun as a program outsider has the chance to fix that now. If he is able to ensure that the elements of the program that led to the hazing are wiped away then the season will be an unmitigated success. Whatever his long-term goals might be his short-term goal should be to create a culture that the fans can support and be proud of. If everything’s going right for the Chicago area that also means that Northwestern football is doing everything right both on and off the field. And no record (good or bad) matters more than that.     \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story NOTE: Northwestern’s curtain-raiser against St. Thomas was moved indoors due to extreme heat in Evanston and as a result was not televised. Since I am currently situated a few thousand miles away from Ryan Fieldhouse I was not in attendance and thus have no way of doing any in-depth work on that match. With that said this article will focus on NU’s second contest of the season a 1-0 win against NJIT. Those of you who followed my articles on the ‘Cats last season will know what to expect with this piece (and of course thanks for the support). However it has been a while since I’ve produced something on this site in this domain and I’d like to think my analytical capacity and knowledge have improved a fair bit since then so be prepared for me to be even more thorough this time around. For those who are less familiar my primary goal is to have both you the reader and my editors wondering “How can someone have so much to say about a game between two amateur American soccer teams?” Providing a high-quality understandable strategic breakdown of whichever match(es) I’m covering is obviously far less of a priority. As I’m only discussing one match today I will separate this article into two sections: Northwestern in possession (IP) and out of possession (OOP) — get used to seeing those abbreviations by the way. Within those sections I’ll break things up into various talking points or situations depending on what makes sense. And at the end I’ll have a few more general topics to touch on. Northwestern OOP I’m starting with the defensive stuff for two reasons. First I like doing the positives before the negatives and the Wildcats were at their best in this phase of the game. Secondly the success they had against the ball fueled a good portion of their success with it. On the ball the Highlanders set up in a 4-2-1-3/4-1-2-3 with the LCM (No. 6) often starting deeper than his right-sided counterpart (No. 10). When they got further up the pitch No. 6 would move higher in the left half-space but that happened so infrequently that it’s unimportant beyond a brief mention now. NU lined up in a standard 4-2-3-1 mid/high block with junior Collin McCamy usually a deeper midfielder or even FB at LW. And as we’ll now get into this structure proved to be an extremely effective foil to what NJIT was aiming to do attacking-wise. To put it simply: Northwestern’s press was stifling. The ‘Cats were clearly prepared for the mechanisms within NJIT’s IP structure and responded to them intelligently when they occurred. The best example of this was the Highlanders’ approach from goal kicks where they insisted on trying to play out for the full 90 minutes. As the cliché goes “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.” I have to imagine then that a picture of NJIT’s build-up patterns against Northwestern would be next to the dictionary entry for “insanity.” The visitors’ strategy in these situations can be divided into two sensible groupings using one simple criterion: whether the goalkeeper’s (No. 1) first pass was to the RCB (No. 19) or the LCB (No. 4). Before looking at those two permutations here’s a general picture of what’s happening pre-restart. The Highlanders are in the (GK-)4-2-1-3 discussed earlier but with an important difference — No. 6 the LCM has moved into the area you’d expect the LB (No. 18) to be and the LB has advanced slightly higher in the wide left channel. NU is still in a 4-2-3-1 waiting to apply the basic pressing principle of forcing the ball to either side of the pitch and then going man-to-man to squeeze the opponent to the touchline and induce a turnover. With that in mind here’s what generally happened when the Highlander GK played to his left. The Wildcats don’t react much initially with the front four shifting slightly ball-side but the moment No. 4 adjusts his orientation to play the next pass toward the touchline they close down quickly. This features a “jump” by junior Ibrahim Obeid (RB No. 3) from being man-oriented on NJIT’s No. 9 to No. 18 and sophomore CB Nigel Prince (No. 12) is responsible for “backing up” by shifting across and getting tight to the attacker Obeid left behind. There should now be nowhere for the Highlanders to go barring a moment of individual quality or a mistake from NU. In the video below they get the latter with sophomore Christopher Thaggard (RW No. 9) continuing his pressing run to No. 4 after No. 6 plays back to him. It’s needless as Justin Weiss (CF No. 10) is already closing down No. 6 and it leaves Thaggard out of position to defend the No. 4 —> No. 18 —> No. 6 circuit. pic.twitter.com/vFPV7Rt8PE From there NJIT finds an out-ball and switches play to its right where it has numbers in space due to the ‘Cats’ dramatic shift toward the left touchline in an attempt to win the ball back. Other than that specific instance Northwestern hardly put a foot wrong from a purely pressing perspective in these scenarios. Here they force a “long” ball but Rom Brown (RDM No. 13) gives away a foul trying to win possession. pic.twitter.com/oEvWjMjYIl And here Obeid intercepts a pass intended for the Highlander LB leading to what could have been a promising transition for NU if not for a foul. However the Wildcats do get a little lucky that Thaggard’s pressing run isn’t punished again with No 6. moving infield and eliminating the possibility of the same circuit occurring again. pic.twitter.com/nfLRT4aRKZ Now let’s go through what happens when the NJIT GK plays to the RCB from the outset. It’s fairly similar to what we’ve seen before except the CM (No. 10) is starting centrally and then dropping between the DM (No. 8) and the RB (No. 2). This makes it even simpler for Northwestern to go man-to-man locally with the Hungarian freshman Peter Riesz (No. 16 LDM) just following that movement and a jump from the fullback on this side Fritz Volmar (No. 19 LB) isn’t needed. Once No. 19 passes to No. 2 — the only option besides going long — the press is triggered and the Highlanders are trapped. In this position the only option for No. 2 is to go back to No. 19 who is left with no choice but to launch the ball up the field. As mentioned previously these situations had a very “by the book” feel. That made it even less likely NJIT would find a way out as the Wildcats were surely comfortable executing pressing mechanisms they’ve certainly practiced quite a few times previously. Just to emphasize the earlier point about insanity here are four examples of the Highlanders trying the same exact thing within the first 20 minutes and getting stymied each time. Again. pic.twitter.com/bcn73bow7n And again. pic.twitter.com/hWKFJBs1mG And again. pic.twitter.com/Zi4rTBcRqp And again. pic.twitter.com/NZTTAemrvC To be fair on the last one the RCB going back to the GK was a little different but that’s why the Wildcats wait until the CB —> FB pass to close down. If they go too early there’s still scope for the opponents to use that momentum against them. The two sides behaved similarly when the away team had the ball outside of the first phase as well but as I said before that hardly happened and that’s because of how strong Northwestern’s press was.  Now I must admit head coach Fernando Barboto and the Highlanders didn’t go the full match without experimenting with potential alternative routes through the ‘Cats’ defensive block. The first of these alterations was to spread the CBs wider from goal kicks and bring the defensive midfielder into the box. The GK would then play to the DM instead of the CBs but this didn’t have much of an impact. pic.twitter.com/1Wl3K2nvSj No. 8 is forced to play to one of the CBs as a result of NU’s initially tight central coverage and from there NJIT is back to square one just with an added pass at the beginning. Northwestern squeezes to the touchline like they’ve been doing and an identical outcome is reached. The other notable change was to have both CMs drift ball-side after the GK —> CB pass in an effort to generate numerical superiority in that area. This pattern had varying success with the video below an example of it working. The ball-far CM (No. 6 on the diagram) pulls the NU attacking midfielder (Jason Gajadhar in the diagram) away from No. 8 and it creates a lane for a FB —> DM ball. pic.twitter.com/EydaQ1R7hy To combat this pattern Northwestern’s DM (Brown in the diagram) or ball-near CB should be responsible for getting tight to the CM coming across the center of the pitch while the AM (Gajadhar in the diagram) sticks to No. 8. NJIT would no longer have an overload and as usual the RB would be forced to play back to the CB who would then go long. Ultimately the ‘Cats kept a clean sheet and were relatively unthreatened from open play — a direct result of a great implementation of an effective gameplan at the top of the pitch. Northwestern IP Just to be clear at the start — I was far less impressed by the Wildcats with the ball than without it. As we’ve come to expect from Payne’s teams in Evanston this year’s group looks like it will be heavily reliant on transitions and set pieces to do damage. It’s a viable strategy but not necessarily my preference especially when there is plenty of room for improvement with the ball everywhere else.  Northwestern like NJIT adopted a 4-2-1-3 shape IP with the double pivot of Brown and Riesz offset to the left while Gajadhar started further forward in the right half-space. Unlike the ‘Cats OOP the Highlanders went with a 4-3-1-2 defensive structure and the pros and cons of that decision will be covered shortly. Before that it would have been unfair for me to not bring some attention to the quality NU showed in offensive transitions. These were generated as discussed in the OOP section either as a result of the Wildcats’ excellent pressing or through stopping an attempted transition by the Highlanders and subsequently catching them in an awkward moment defensively. pic.twitter.com/me0aqYsaFO The lone goal of the day was a good example of this. The NJIT goalkeeper tries to initiate a quick counter-attack with a long ball to No. 10 running in behind in the wide left channel but Obeid wins it in the air and Brown recovers possession. From there he’s given far too much time to pick a pass. That’s because NJIT’s AM was responsible for marking Brown but is way out of position and no one else picked him up immediately or tracked his run into the box. There are also situations like this where an innocuous throw-in from deep in its own half turns into transition for Northwestern because it wins a second ball. Some very lovely link-up between Thaggard and Gajadhar down the right as well with the latter an especially dangerous threat with the ball at his feet and space to drive into. pic.twitter.com/CKddpEgbGH Of all the different parts and phases of this match this is the area where I was most disappointed with the ‘Cats’ efforts. They had three very poor attempts at playing out at the beginning of the match and went exclusively going long after. To me there was a clear opportunity to do so but the players seemed unaware of the solutions. There are a host of possible explanations for this so I will refrain from blaming any group or individual in particular. What I will do however is explain what happened on those three attempts and then I will offer up some ideas of my own as to how this very exploitable press could’ve been broken. pic.twitter.com/ja98Sz3inf In this sequence Owen Noverr (LCB No. 15) starts with the ball on the left edge of the six-yard box and plays across to Jackson Weyman (GK No. 1). This triggers the RST (No. 24) in NJIT’s 4-3-1-2 to close down Weyman while the AM (No. 10) shifts across to block the lane from the NU GK to Brown. Now the important bit here is Weyman’s orientation. As can be seen in the clip the GK keeps himself facing directly forward for a second even taking another touch before seeing the pressure. In that moment Weyman takes his third touch to his right and with the Highlander LCM (No. 6) and DM (No. 8) jumping to Obeid and Gajadhar respectively he resorts to sending the ball up to Thaggard.  pic.twitter.com/m1Ze14Hk2x This time Weyman starts with the ball and plays to Novarr triggering a jump from No. 24 to the LCB. The freshman CB immediately sends the ball on its way to Volmar at LB which let me tell you now is exactly the pass NJIT wants him to make. A 4-3-1-2 press feasts on FB reception as the ball-near WCM (No. 7 here) jumps to the FB and everyone else on that side goes man-to-man. pic.twitter.com/hjc5iylvly The final and least imaginative of the three Weyman clips a ball directly to Obeid at RB. Remember what I just said about a 4-3-1-2 press feasting on FB reception? Well this is a prime example of that. As the ball floats in the air the ball near WCM (No. 6) jumps to the FB and then it’s man-to-man with that FB receiving in a position of almost no hope. Potential Solutions Right now you might be thinking “I can see why they decided to stop trying to play short from goal kicks” and to that I say “Nonsense!” Why? Because there is a much finer level of detail and precision involved in how things go on the pitch than what can be displayed on a tactics board. Timing and distances play a massive role and the Highlanders were far from perfect in either regard. Additionally NU hardly gave itself a chance with how little movement there was off the ball.  So let’s explore how the ‘Cats could’ve done better in breaking this press using two of my favorite IP actions: well-timed arrivals and wall passes. For the sake of this exercise I’m going to leave Northwestern’s starting structure unchanged but best believe that could be improved too given what NJIT is doing. Let’s go back to Attempt One where the first pass was Noverr —> Weyman. When I introduced this sequence I made sure to emphasize Weyman’s orientation when he receives the ball as well as the time he has until No. 24 can get to him. Additionally I depicted one important detail on the board: the terrible angle of No. 24’s pressing run. He moves directly at the Wildcat GK which when combined with the distance he has to cover means the pass back to Noverr is so so so open.  Weyman just needs to have some courage and let the NJIT ST get close before sending the ball back to the LCB at the last possible moment. Noverr should also move wider to lengthen the distance between him and No. 24 when he receives. This gives Noverr the ball in space with an overload in front of him. At the very minimum Northwestern should be able to exit the first phase and establish possession 30 or 40 yards up the pitch but just for fun let’s go through how the potency of this situation could be maximized. Once Noverr receives Riesz should drop towards him (pulling No. 7 with) while Volmar simultaneously drops to ensure he stays level with or deeper than the midfielder. Noverr then fires a ball into Riesz’s feet and with his first touch the Hungarian lays the ball off for the LB (a “wall pass”). From here Volmar just needs to drive infield — on his favored right foot which is a bonus — and the Wildcats have generated a “faux transition.” Something similar can happen with Attempt Two (first pass Weyman —> Novarr). Once again the pressing run from No. 24 leaves a lot available to Novarr. The CB needs to not commit to the pass to Volmar so quickly instead waiting to draw No. 24. in closer and then with no one closing down Weyman he should play back to the GK. Presumably No. 24 will continue his run toward Weyman meaning Noverr becomes the free man and as such Northwestern needs to find a way to access him. My favored method here is to utilize another Riesz arrival wall pass to Noverr who then plays to Volmar with room to once again carry forward. There are a lot of other possible solutions including alternatives within the options I presented as well as ways for the Highlanders to counter these ideas but for the sake of maintaining some brevity in this article I’ll stop here. The bottom line: well-timed off-the-ball movement is the key and currently there isn’t much of it. Lastly as far as IP stuff goes I wanted to highlight two things that go hand-in-hand (somewhat) Northwestern did well to manipulate NJIT’s block. One of those is horizontally decompacting the Highlanders’ midfield three. As has been covered the WCMs in a 4-3-1-2 are responsible for jumping to the opposition FBs when they receive. That leaves a lot of space centrally for the DM to cover so baiting that jump (when temporally and spatially feasible usually following a switch of play) to then play back inside can be very profitable for the IP team. pic.twitter.com/8UzUGSgLuF The above video illustrates this well. The ball starts with Noverr on the left side of the pitch and gets quickly moved out to the right wing where Obeid has time before No. 6 (LCM) is on him. With NJIT’s midfield still shifting ball-side the RB is able to find Gajadhar inside who nearly gets an ambitious ball in behind to Thaggard to come off. This is where the second card NU had up its sleeve comes into play. When Obeid received Thaggard would usually drop toward the ball pulling his marker the LB (No. 18) with. As a result space opened up behind the LB for Gajadhar to move into forcing either the LCB (No. 4) or DM (No. 8) to cover that run. If No. 8 went to follow NJIT’s midfield presence completely disappeared giving Obeid plenty of space inside to carry into. His decision to pass with his weaker left here does let him down though. pic.twitter.com/QdgNkuvVoH Here Obeid is able to receive deeper and finds Thaggard down the line who can then play to Gajadhar moving into the channel behind the LB. The AM performs a nice backheel to get the ball to Brown running forward but he fails to do anything with it. pic.twitter.com/zV6GRc3enQ Finally exploiting the space behind the Highlander FBs was not limited to the right side of the pitch.  In this instance a careless jump by the NJIT CF allows Noverr to receive and carry forward enough for Volmar to get the ball beyond the reach of the RCM. This in turn forces the RB to jump allowing Jayvin van Deventer (in at AM) to run into the vacated space and receive from the freshman LB.  pic.twitter.com/XyzXl9hd92 Other Comments and Notes   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story For the first time since 2018 Northwestern field hockey came out of its first match winless. Even though the ‘Cats outshot No. 9 Louisville 21-3 the Cardinals snatched the road victory at Lakeside Field on Sunday afternoon with a third-quarter goal by fifth-year midfielder Emilia Kaczmarczyk. Coming in both schools had a history of playing each other tightly; NU beat Louisville in overtime during the second round of the 2017 postseason to advance to the NCAA Quarterfinals. Ultimately this top-10 tilt was another close battle though Northwestern constantly seemed to put itself on the verge of breaking the match open. Even without First Team All-American midfielder Maddie Zimmer who will not play for the ‘Cats this season after earning a spot on the 2024 U.S. Olympic team Northwestern’s offense seized momentum from the opening push back. A little over 90 seconds in Alia Marshall drew a corner which set up sophomore back Maja Zivojnovic for a shot on goal that was blocked by Louisville’s defense. That set the tone for the rest of the quarter. After a few minutes of alternating possession with the Cardinals NU put up two more shots on target. Goalkeeper Merlijn van der Vegt saved one from Peyton Halsey and denied one from Chloe Relford near the end of the quarter with a kick save. The second quarter was even more lopsided with the Wildcats slapping nine shots and three on goal. Tracey Fuchs’ highly-touted first-years made their presences felt as Olivia Bent-Cole and Ella Kokinis pressured the defense with the first two shots of the period. Although Louisville blocked both of those the ‘Cats got closer and closer to putting one in the net. In a 10-second sequence Lane Herbert forced van der Vegt to make another save before Zivojnovic fired a shot off the post. The same sequence kept repeating itself: pressure from Northwestern a shot a save and a deflection off a rebound that ended up away from the goal. Going into halftime Louisville hadn’t even mustered a corner nor a single shot let alone one on goal. The Wildcats took 13 and six were on target. It was a suffocating defense led by van der Vegt who had accrued six saves in the first 30 minutes that primarily kept NU off the scoreboard. Six minutes into the third quarter the Cardinals drew their first corner of the game. That was all they needed to break through as Kaczmarczyk netted Louisville’s first shot of the game past Annabel Skubisz to score the only goal of the match. Off the corner pass from Aimee Plumb Mia Duchars lightly tapped it over to Kaczmarczyk throwing off the NU defense. Anticipating the shot from Duchars Northwestern keeper Annabel Skubisz lost her balance which left an open path for Kaczmarczyk to bury the decisive goal. From there Northwestern continued to bring as much offensive pressure as it could. The ‘Cats fired off five more shots in the third quarter but they were all either blocked by Louisville’s defense or saved by van der Vegt. As the clock began ticking down Louisville’s defense only got stiffer. Even though Fuchs pulled Skubisz with a few minutes to go the Wildcats only managed to get two shots off. The Cardinals controlled the pace and came away with the season-opening win in Evanston. All in all it was a remarkable performance for van der Vegt. They faced 21 shots — shattering their highest total in a shutout — and saved nine of them. A career performance like that against the national runner-ups is quite the way to introduce yourself to a new team. The backs also passed their tough test with flying colors; Julie Kouijzer played all 60 minutes and constantly snuffed out NU’s threats on goal with deflections. While Northwestern couldn’t capitalize there were a lot of positives to take away. The first one is that the end result was a massive anomaly. Since at least 2009 which is about as far as the detailed box scores from NUSports.com go Northwestern has never put up 20 or more shots in a match without scoring a goal. Additionally NU hasn’t ever outshot a team by 18 or more without coming away with a win.  Let’s take a wild guess and assume that both of those facts hold true for several years prior to that. This was a truly unprecedented result for Northwestern one that would fit just perfectly in a Jon Bois video. Although the ‘Cats somehow lost they applied immense offensive pressure and dominated in that regard against a top-10 team in the country. If they can outshoot other opponents by this much — whether it’s Iowa or the worst team on their schedule — then it’s very very likely they will win an overwhelming amount of their contests. Northwestern may not have been able to finish but it’s pretty clear that the offense will at least able to generate a steady threat despite losing two All-Americans in Bente Baekers and Zimmer. \tEven better it was some of the younger players who led the way. Zivojnovic Bent-Cole and Ilse Tromp — a sophomore and two first-years making their debuts respectively —  put up a combined 10 shots and six on goal. The defense with the exception of its mistimed adjustment on Louisville’s one successful corner also played well.  The competition won’t get much easier for now as Northwestern heads to College Park Maryland to face No. 17 Boston College on Friday and No. 20 Duke on Sunday in the Big Ten/ACC Challenge.

Share this story Traveling all the way across the country Northwestern volleyball found itself saying “aloha” to the 2023 season kicking off the year in Hawaii. The ‘Cats took part in the Hawaiian Airlines Rainbow Wahine Classic seeing three West Coast opponents to start their non-conference slate. In the inaugural matchup against Hawaii both sides traded sets but the Rainbow Wahine pulled away in the fifth set to send the Wildcats back to the hotel with a 3-2 loss.  It did not get any easier for Northwestern as it was swept in three straight sets by No. 9 Oregon the following day. With one match left on the island NU would have to upset one of the top teams in the nation No. 13 San Diego. The Wildcats picked up the opening set over the Toreros and never looked back cruising to a 3-1 win their first victory of the season. With the ‘Cats back on the mainland here are the takeaways from their trip to Hawaii: Julia Sangiacomo is the key to NU’s offense ""Losing Temi Thomas-Ailara was a big loss for the Wildcats; however the arrival of the fifth-year from Santa Clara has lightened the burden on NU’s offense. In her first weekend in purple and white Sangiacomo was dominant. She racked up 48 kills in the three matches over the weekend more than double any of her teammates. Now she did have 28 errors but nearly half of those came in the first game against Hawaii. In the Wildcats upset against San Diego No. 22 picked up her first 20+ kill game as a Wildcat but with the way she played expect those to come often. Her performance this past weekend earned her All-Tournament honors."" Watching her it felt like defenses had no answers for Sangiacomo. The ball came off her hand like a missile sometimes too strong. At 6-foot-5 No. 22 towers over opponents giving her space to spike. It may have just been the first weekend but Sangiacomo may turn out to be the key piece to unlocking Northwestern’s offense and taking it to the NCAA Tournament. Contributions are coming from everywhere In NU’s opening weekend 75% of the team saw minutes and each player provided value on the court. All five transfers saw the floor providing key contributions across the tournament. Alongside Sangiacomo Maddie Chinn added 20 kills and seven blocks and Ellie Husemann added nine kills and seven blocks too. Rylan Reid saw limited minutes but provided a jolt of energy off the bench for the Wildcats. Both first-years Drew Wright and Gigi Navarrete made their collegiate debuts during the opening weekend and recorded their first stats.  For the returning Wildcats many found themselves in larger roles than a season ago. Leilani Dodson NU’s primary middle blocker racked up 12 kills and eight blocks in the ‘Cats’ season opener against Hawaii and added another six blocks in Northwestern’s upset over San Diego. Elle Stinston stepping into the starting lineup was a defensive weapon recording 58 digs over the three games. Alexa Rousseau did exactly what she has done her entire career setting her teammates for over 100 assists in the tournament.  Even players like Kennedy Hill who saw limited action in her inaugural season showed improvements already in 2023. Hill picked up four blocks in NU’s win over USD.  It is going to take every member of the Wildcats to exceed expectations if they finally want to reach the NCAA tournament. So far Northwestern’s depth has shined in 2023.  Too Many Errors For the beginning of the season this was to be expected. However it felt like the ‘Cats gifted their opponents points throughout the weekend. In the Hawaii game alone NU had nearly 50 errors allowing the Rainbow Wahine to go on multiple long scoring runs. Against Oregon NU cut down on the amount of service errors but had 10 more attacking errors than the Ducks. In the Wildcats’ lone win the tournament they still had more service errors but won the battle of attacking errors. In close games handing opponents free points will be the difference between wins and losses. Self-inflicted wounds derailed the ‘Cats’ season; Northwestern will need to play clean volleyball to put itself in tournament contention this year.

Share this story The glory of Big Ten football kicks off tonight with upstart Nebraska traveling to Minneapolis to battle the Minnesota Golden Gophers. However fans of the purple and white will have to wait three more days before Northwestern takes the field against Rutgers. After a summer of upsetting details and discussions unforeseen decisions and overall chaos it can be reassuring to know that a renewed Wildcats season is just around the corner. At the same time considerable uncertainty looms over this program — and that extends to the team’s Week One matchup. NU won just one game a season ago and hasn’t emerged victorious in America since mid-October 2021. The opponent in that contest? The Scarlet Knights. Just as that matchup was viewed as somewhat of a toss-up this year’s beginning truthfully appears to be ripe for the picking; ESPN grants Rutgers a 48.7% chance of victory with the ‘Cats at 51.3%. A boatload of hypotheticals have assuredly played out in the minds of pundits and supporters alike on both sides of the coin for two squads that are in desperate need of success but which field teams with considerable question marks up and down their rosters and staffs. While it’s difficult to reduce a football game’s outcome into just three major concepts here are some significant reasons why Northwestern will or will not take down Rutgers on Sunday. \nWhy Northwestern will beat Rutgers\n More productivity and fewer miscues under center For the second straight season Northwestern was the victim of bad quarterback play in 2022 fostering little week-to-week stability at the position. Despite the insertion of then-sophomore Brendan Sullivan into the lineup in Week Six the Wildcats’ eventual five QBs finished with a combined 10 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. Not one posted a PFF grade above 59. With the addition of sixth-year Cincinnati transfer Ben Bryant this spring the ‘Cats are optimistic that either Bryant or Sullivan — whichever won the team’s quarterback battle as we’ll likely find out moments before kick Sunday — will elevate one of the worst offenses in the country. If Bryant does get the nod he’d seem to be an instant upgrade on paper boasting an 81.6 PFF grade a season ago. Regardless of whoever starts for NU that player must be tasked with generating chunk plays on offense and critically not surrendering the ball. The Wildcats had just three games last year in which their gunslingers did not give away the pigskin and it might not shock you to learn that one was against Nebraska in Ireland. Not all of the team’s offensive responsibilities are on the quarterback’s shoulders. For example Cam Porter will need to prove to establish some type of ground game and the team’s receiving options — notably A.J. Henning Cam Johnson and Thomas Gordon — need to separate and create explosive plays. But at the end of the day Northwestern’s quarterback play might be the single biggest determining factor in deciding this game. A secondary that comes into its own On paper an apparent weakness for Rutgers lies in its receiver room. The Scarlet Knights lose top options from a year ago in Aron Cruikshank and Sean Ryan. Tight end Johnny Langan and receiver Chris Long are the only two opposing pass-catchers to have netted 200+ receiving yards last season. RU added two productive wideouts in the portal in Naseim Brantley and JaQuae Jackson but neither has ever suited up in the FBS level let alone against Big Ten competition. Consequently Northwestern could swing the tide if its secondary defends tightly against the pass. The Wildcats experience turnover of their own in the back end sans Cam Mitchell and A.J. Hampton but projected starting cornerbacks Garnett Hollis Jr. and Theran Johnson both played over 240 snaps last year. Moreover David Braun boasts versatility in players like Rod Heard II and Devin Turner and the return of big-hitting safety Coco Azema should be impactful. The onus might still lie on NU’s defensive line to control the line of scrimmage much better than it did a year ago but if the team’s secondary blankets a subpar group of receivers life on offense could be tough for the Scarlet Knights. A jolt of energy channeled into Week One Following the firing of Pat Fitzgerald on July 10 and in the wake of considerable fundamental questions about the status and culture of the program Northwestern’s players have seemed to rally around a common cause of going out and succeeding on the field. Every press conference in which players have spoken has featured refrains about togetherness perseverance and a desire to “flip the narrative” as Bryant put it. On top of that motivation Braun will be coaching in his first matchup as NU’s head coach. Across multiple levels of football teams can certainly become invigorated after a new leader takes over. For instance the nine interim college football coaches last year combined to post a 5-4 mark in their first games at the helm. What transpired in the last two months can be funneled into countless expressions on diametrically opposite ends of the scale. But if Northwestern can translate that sense into putting forth everything it can into winning this game — and starting a new era on the right foot — then a victory is well within sight. \nWhy Northwestern won’t beat Rutgers\n Kirk Ciarrocca’s experience against the Wildcats For the second straight season opener Northwestern will go toe-to-toe with a new offensive coordinator at a Big Ten school — and a seasoned one at that. This offseason Rutgers coach Greg Schiano added former Penn State and Minnesota OC Kirk Ciarrocca to his staff in the hopes of bolstering an offense that averaged just 17.4 points per game in 2022. Having spent four years in Minneapolis since 2019 Ciarrocca has gameplanned for Northwestern more than the average offensive coordinator especially in the Big Ten East. The focal point of his units has effectively been running the ball: last year UMN averaged a prolific 207.5 yards on the ground per game which was second in the conference. More specifically mitigating the run has dictated NU’s recent matchups with the Ciarrocca-led Gophers. Take a look at these numbers from the past four games which illustrate a clear trend. ""New Rutgers OC Kirk Ciarrocca is no stranger to facing Northwestern. Here are some rushing yardage totals from his games coaching against the Wildcats:2022: 3022019: 2122018: 1092017: 139NU won the last two games and its no secret why. Stopping the run will be paramount."" To what extend Ciarrocca will seek to implement a run-first approach in Piscataway is unknown especially with the development of former four-star Gavin Wimsatt close to the top the program’s hierarchy of needs. Early in the year though expect plenty of carries for Scarlet Knight RBs Samuel Brown V Kyle Monangai and Aaron Young — if nothing else but to test the Wildcats’ revamped defensive line. A sound Scarlet Knight defense The superficial numbers on Rutgers’ 2022 defense were not outstanding as it allowed 29.2 points and 349.7 yards per game and ranked ninth in the conference in EPA/play. But there’s still considerable talent on the Scarlet Knights’ defense which second-year DC Joe Harasymiak hopes will translate better into on-field results. RU’s defensive line boasts two formidable presences in Aaron Lewis and Wesley Bailey both of whom collected 32 or more pressures a season ago. Against a Northwestern offensive line likely to field three new starters at four nascent positions the war in the trenches would lean in Rutgers’ favor based on those two pass rushers alone. Additionally Rutgers’ linebacking corps includes redshirt senior Deion Jennings who posted 91 tackles and a team-high 8.5 tackles for loss last year. Fellow ‘backer Tyreem Powell accumulated three sacks 18 pressures and six TFL of his own. The Scarlet Knights will lose several veterans in their secondary highlighted by Christian Braswell Christian Izien and Avery Young. Nonetheless the team returns veteran cornerbacks Max Melton and Robert Longerbeam who combined for 16 pass deflections and four interceptions last campaign. Whether or not Rutgers’ defense jumps to above average will drive much of its season success but there’s noticeable skill in all three levels of Harasymiak’s unit. That could create havoc for a Northwestern offense that not only was futile last year but which has little-to-no familiarity with most key starters. Inexperience across the board This concept will be critical for Northwestern’s entire 2023 season and particularly so in the opener. In terms of returning production the ‘Cats will lose all of their offensive players to see 600 or more snaps last year — breaking down positionally into four O-linemen and two receivers — and four of the eight defenders to play 545+ snaps in 2022. Whether through the NFL Draft or the transfer portal considerable gaps were created on this roster with younger and/or less experienced players needing to replace veteran producers. Altogether Northwestern will likely have six new starters on offense and at least four on defense. That’s nearly half of the projected 22 starters. Beyond those on the field the Wildcats’ coaching staff has also largely not been exposed to coaching in a Big Ten game. That starts at the top with Braun — who will be in his first ever FBS game on Sunday — but extends to key assistants like Chris Foster and LaMarcus Hicks. In August Braun expressed a greater sense of comfort regarding gameday operations following the team’s two scrimmages in Ryan Field. But those intra-squad matchups won’t fully simulate being in enemy territory in an actual meaningful contest. Key logistical questions — such as how Braun challenges a play with Skip Holtz’s input or how Braun communicates with Mike Bajakian to determine a fourth-down decision — will only be fully realized for the first time on Sunday. Nerves for an opener are a very real thing; they’re likely magnified for those who have never coached in a Big Ten environment. While a revamped core and staff could generate positivity it also poses an extra considerable challenge that Northwestern must encounter. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story College football is back. It’s been a long six and a half months but the wait is finally over. Week One of the 2023-24 season is just around the corner and it’s going to be a season of lasts around the sport. It’s the last year the Big Ten is using the two-division format and the last year before teams from the other side of the Rocky Mountains join the conference. The author is going to try and appreciate every week of this season for what it brings because while this sport is flawed it’s still college football and there are few things better than that. On to the conference itself. Last year the Big Ten joined the SEC as the only conference to ever put two teams in the College Football Playoff in the same year when Michigan and Ohio State both made it. There’s a chance the conference could do it again this year but after the three teams at the top the Big Ten does not have a whole lot of national contenders available. The East will be a bloodbath with three top-10 teams nationally vying for the title while the West will be a different sort of bloodbath with every “contender” dealing with major question marks. Without further ado let’s dive into the power rankings and see if we can answer some of those aforementioned questions. 1. Michigan Last Year: 13-1 (9-0 B1G) Big Ten Champions CFP Semifinalist Next Game: vs. East Carolina Biggest Game: vs. Ohio State Week 13 The Wolverines have the best backfield in this conference. And given that this conference contains (among other names) TreVeyon Henderson Braelon Allen Nicholas Singleton and Miyan Williams that is a bold claim to make. But it deserves to be made. Blake Corum (1463 yards 18 TD last year in 11 full games) is going to be a legitimate Heisman candidate Donovan Edwards (991 yards seven TD last year) would be the best running back on about 10 teams in this conference and J.J McCarthy ran for 306 yards last year as a quarterback. The defense is also going to be stacked. Kris Jenkins and Mason Graham return to a defensive line that allowed just 98 rushing yards per game last season (seventh-best in the country) and Will Johnson Rod Moore and Mike Sainristil all return to boost a secondary that was very young last year. This team probably won’t even be tested until Week 11 when it travels to face Penn State but by then both the offense and defense will be in full form. Don’t be shocked if Michigan returns to the College Football Playoff for a third consecutive year. 2. Penn State Last Year: 11-2 (7-2 B1G) Rose Bowl Champions Next Game: vs. West Virginia Biggest Game: vs. Michigan Week 11 How good is Drew Allar going to be? One of the best quarterbacks in the Class of 2022 Allar saw action in 10 games last year going 35-for-60 with 344 yards and four touchdowns. Penn State has had a basically unbroken string of solid quarterback play for almost a decade with Trace McSorley and Sean Clifford combining for a record of 63-23 during their time at the school. If Allar can exceed their level of production (which is a real possibility) then he might be able to do what they could not and take Penn State to the Playoff. It won’t be all on Allar of course. Nicholas Singleton and Kaytron Allen became the first pair of freshmen to rush for 700 or more yards as teammates in Big Ten history last year and they certainly didn’t get any worse in the offseason. Defending All-American cornerback Kalen King leads a stingy defense that averaged two forced turnovers a game last year and defensive end Chop Robinson could make quarterbacks’ lives miserable this year. The Nittany Lions have to travel to Ohio State but draw Michigan at home. If they can just split those games than a Big Ten conference title (and potentially a whole lot more) might just be in the cards 3. Ohio State Last Year: 11-2 (8-1 B1G) CFP Semifinalist Next Game: at Indiana  Biggest Game: vs. Penn State Week 8 Can Kyle McCord be the next A.J. McCarron? It might sound like a convoluted comparison but think about it. McCarron sat for a year at Alabama became a full-time starter in his third season at the school as a redshirt sophomore and proceeded to go 36-4 and win consecutive national championships. McCord is in his third year at Ohio State has seen bits and pieces of action the last two years and joins a loaded offense. Whether or not McCord can earn the job (backup Devin Brown will receive time against Indiana) remains to be seen. It’s almost a shame the question mark at quarterback is so big because this offense is loaded. The last five Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year winners have all been Buckeye quarterbacks but this year another position player may take that award. Marvin Harrison Jr. Emeka Egbuka and Julian Fleming will all probably be first-round draft picks at wide receiver as soon as they leave college and don’t forget about TreVeyon Henderson and Miyan Williams in the backfield. Oh yeah Tommy Eichenberg and JT Tuimoloau are back on defense. If the question mark at QB disappears this is the year for Ohio State to get back on top in the Big Ten. 4. Wisconsin Last Year: 7-6 (4-5 B!G) Guaranteed Rate Bowl Champions Next Game: vs. Buffalo  Biggest Game: at Illinois Week 8 The Badgers are taking “new year new me” incredibly seriously. After firing head coach Paul Chryst (who compiled a 67-26 record along with three division titles at the school) in October of his eighth season Wisconsin went in a completely different direction for his replacement. Luke Fickell one of the hottest names on the coaching market chose Wisconsin after a spectacular 57-18 tenure at Cincinnati that saw the school compile three seasons of 11 or more wins and a College Football Playoff berth. ""However Fickell didn’t get those wins by playing Wisconsin-style football. His offense is far more passing-based and SMU transfer Tanner Mordecai will be the guy to pilot his offense this year. Wisconsins receiving corps is nowhere near the level of Ohio State’s but Chimere Dike is a very good receiver and both Braelon Allen and Chez Mellusi could be good dump-off options out of the backfield. The defense is still going to be your typical Wisconsin defense: very good very physical very tough to score on. But if the offense can take a jump from last year’s 26.3 points per game then the Badgers could very easily win their seventh (and final) Big Ten division title."" 5. Iowa Last Year: 8-5 (5-4 B1G) Music City Bowl Champions Next Game: vs. Utah State Biggest Game: at Wisconsin Week 7 Speaking of offensive improvement... The Hawkeyes offense was anemic last year there’s simply no other way to put it. It averaged 17.7 points per game which was a bottom-10 mark in the country and four of its five losses came without giving up 28 points. Iowa had arguably the best defense in the nation last year but the end result was 8-5 because the offense was one of college football’s worst. Maybe this year will be different. Cade McNamara is here from Michigan and in 2021 he did lead the Wolverines to the CFP a run that included a win over Iowa. The secondary is still going to be dominant thanks to Cooper DeJean and Quinn Schulte and the Hawkeyes boast what’s probably the best special teams unit in the Big Ten. If the offense can get out of its own way long enough to consistently score 21 or more then the Hawkeyes could very easily put together a division title run. 6. Maryland Last Year: 8-5 (4-5 B1G) Mayo Bowl Champions Next Game: vs. Towson Biggest Game: vs. Illinois Week 7 Can the Terrapins put together three straight winning seasons for the first time since 2003? The Big Ten schedule-makers seem determined to prevent that. Maryland has to travel to Michigan State Ohio State and Nebraska and welcomes both Penn State and Michigan to the friendly confines of College Park. At most Maryland will be favored in one of those games and all of them are going to be tricky (if not impossible) to deal with and come out with a victory. So how can Mike Locksley’s Terrapins get back to bowl play? ""Simple: it’s Taulia time. Taulia Tagovailoa (younger brother of Tua) has become a legitimate star and after a Second-Team All-Big Ten season last year he’s looking for more in his senior season. While the Big Ten generally can count on strong quarterback play from a number of teams it’s pretty thin on the ground this year. Theres an argument to be made that Tagovailoa is the best QB in the conference this year and if running back Roman Hemby and a sneaky good defense continue to make leaps Maryland could put a real scare into the Big Ten’s big dogs this season. "" 7. Minnesota Last Year: 9-4 (5-4 B1G) Bad Boy Mowers Pinstripe Bowl Champions Next Game: vs. Nebraska Biggest Game: at Iowa Week 8 Here’s a fun fact for you: despite a 44-27 record Minnesota has never made the Big Ten title game under P.J. Fleck. In fact the Golden Gophers haven’t even split a conference title since 1967. That streak probably won’t be broken this year given that Minnesota welcomes Michigan and Wisconsin but also travels to North Carolina Iowa and Ohio State. While Athan Kaliakmanis did earn five starts last year that was a short runway for what will probably be a season filled with losable games week in and week out. Further complicating matters is the production the Golden Gophers lost in the offseason. They return slightly under 60% of their production but among the departed players are superstar running back Mohamed Ibrahim stalwart center John Michael Schmitz quarterback Tanner Morgan and leading tackler Mariano Sori-Marin. The receiving corps should be really good thanks to Brevyn Spann-Ford and Chris Autmann-Bell and the defense (especially the secondary) is still plenty experienced but if Kaliakmanis doesn’t have the ability to take over games then a regression from 9-4 seems imminent. 8. Illinois Last Year: 8-5 (5-4 B1G) Reliaquest Bowl appearance Next Game: vs. Toledo Biggest Game: at Minnesota Week 10 ""Weve been talking a lot the last few teams about hard schedules. It’s time for a break from that. Illinois avoids Ohio State AND Michigan and it gets both Penn State and Wisconsin at home. It’s the third-easiest schedule in the Big Ten West and it’s a big reason why Illinois could contend for the division. Another reason is its defense which was second in the nation last year in yardage allowed per game. Jer’Zhan Newton and Keith Randolph Jr. are both back on the defensive line and the team led the nation in turnovers forced last year with an astonishing 32."" ""As for the offense... well lets just say Iowa wasn’t the only defensive juggernaut that struggled to score points last year. Isaiah Williams is one of the best-kept secrets in the Big Ten (PFF has him on its All-Big Ten First Team along with two Ohio State receivers) but other than him it’s pretty slim pickings. Tommy DeVito and Chase Brown have departed leaving transfer Luke Altmeyer and Brown’s backup Reggie Love III to pick up the pieces. If they can another eight-win season might be in the cards."" 9. Purdue  Last Year: 8-6 (6-3 B1G) Big Ten West Champions Citrus Bowl participants Next Game: vs. Fresno State Biggest Game: at Nebraska Week 9 Speaking of the Illinois defense some of its mojo just may have migrated to West Lafayette. New head coach Ryan Walters (at 37 the eighth-youngest FBS coach) was the defensive coordinator for the Illini and took them from the 97th-ranked scoring defense the year before he got there to the top scoring defense in the country last season. Considering Purdue’s tendency to lose a lot of shootouts hiring a guy who coordinated a defense that gave up just 12.3 points per game last year is probably a good idea.  On offense Texas transfer Hudson Card will have his work cut out for him. Devin Mockobee is back at running back but leading receiver Charlie Jones departed after a sixth season of college football. The schedule is also not very kind to the Boilermakers with 10 of their games coming against top-50 defenses. Their offense is solid but if they want to get back to above .500 solid isn’t going to cut it. The offense needs to be great. 10. Nebraska Last Year: 4-8 (3-6 B1G) Next Game: at Minnesota Biggest Game: at Illinois Week 6 The Matt Rhule era is officially here and Nebraska fans are... trying not to feel too hopeful. After the hometown hero hire of Scott Frost flamed out spectacularly the Cornhuskers decided they needed a coach who was well not Scott Frost. Enter Rhule who’s previously shown his coaching acumen by turning around Temple and Baylor. He’s provided a jolt to this program but coaches can’t really impact what goes on once the ball is snapped.  Luckily for Rhule he’s got a pretty solid bunch of players. Unlike in years past this team has an edge to it exemplified by the defense. John Bullock a former walk-on who earned a scholarship in the summer and will receive time at linebacker after only playing on special teams the last two years has earned a Blackshirt traditionally signifying that a player is a defensive starter. He also earned a single-digit jersey a tradition Rhule brought to the school that denotes the toughest players on the team. Bullock is the personification of this team’s mentality. The Cornhuskers may have less talent than in previous years but they’ll definitely have more bite. Time will tell whether that results in wins. 11. Michigan State Last Year: 5-7 (3-6 B1G) Next Game: vs. Central Michigan Biggest Game: vs. Maryland Week 4 Last year was definitely not ideal for the Spartans who slumped to 5-7 after an 11-2 2021. Six of the seven losses came by double digits suggesting that the team simply wasn’t good. To make matters worse starters Payton Thorne Keon Coleman and Elijah Collins all left in the transfer portal. The offense might be able to bounce back depending on how well junior Noah Kim handles starting at quarterback but the real issue was the defense. On the defensive side of the ball Michigan State wasn’t spartan at all. It gave up over 416 yards per game ahead of only Indiana in the Big Ten and good enough for a bottom-30 mark in the nation. That should be helped by transfers like Tunmise Adeleye and Semar Melvin but the key is for the returnees to take a step forward. Jacoby Windmon was really good last year before getting hurt and Cal Haladay earned second-team All-Big Ten last year. If it can take another leap forward (and if the secondary can grow up) Michigan State could get itself back over .500 this year. 12. Indiana Last Year: 4-8 (2-7 B1G) Next Game: vs. Ohio State Biggest Game: vs. Michigan State Week 12 Someone please tell Tom Allen that keeping his starting kicker close to the vest isn’t going to get this team to a bowl game. Indiana has to deal with Ohio State Maryland (on the road) Michigan (on the road) Penn State (on the road) Wisconsin and Illinois (on the road). That is five of the top six schools on this list and whether it’s Tayven Jackson or Brendan Sorsby under center for the Hoosiers they’re probably losing all five of those games handily. On the bright side Jaylin Lucas might be the best return man in the country as evidenced by his 591 yards and two touchdowns in the kick return game. Cam Camper totaled 569 receiving yards last year despite tearing his ACL in his seventh game and he’s back and healthy this year. However two dynamic playmakers are not enough to save a team especially one that will only be favored in three contests this year. 13. Rutgers Last Year: 4-8 (1-8 B1G) Next Game: vs. Northwestern Biggest Game: at Indiana Week 8 Good luck this year Scarlet Knights. This team will be favored in one game after Week 3 and that game is against FCS school Wagner. Aaron Lewis was honorable-mention All-Big Ten last year but he is literally the only Rutgers player that made PFF’s All-Big Ten preseason teams this year. Gavin Wimsatt is back at quarterback after six starts last season but he completed just 45% of his passes and threw more touchdowns than interceptions. Rutgers was one of the five worst teams in the country at getting first downs last year — it finished with 178 for the season just over half of what FBS leader Washington got. That of course led to some anemic scoring with a mark of 17.4 points per game even worse than Iowa’s output last season. And unlike Iowa Rutgers didn’t put forth a great defense giving up 29.3 points per game. It’s likely going to be a ninth straight losing season for the Scarlet Knights but it could be worse. 14. Northwestern Last Year: 1-11 (1-8 B1G) Next Game: at Rutgers Biggest Game: vs. Maryland Week 9 I don’t think there’s any argument that these past 12 months have been some of the worst in Northwestern history. This site and several other publications have already delved deeply into what’s happened over that timeline so I’m going to focus on the next three months instead. For the positives: Coco Azema will be one of the best safeties in the Big Ten especially if he can stay healthy. Bryce Gallagher will once again be high up the leaderboards for tackles and will probably crack the century mark again. The defense as a whole has become a little underrated and could definitely throw a scare into some teams this year. As for the other stuff: Cam Porter is probably going to be the lead back and should fill Evan Hull’s shoes nicely. Michigan transfer A.J. Henning is going to make a big impact at wide receiver and Bryce Kirtz and Thomas Gordon provide some continuity in catching the ball. But it probably won’t change too much for an offense that couldn’t crack the top 90 nationally in either passing or rushing yardage last year. Whether Ben Bryant or Brendan Sullivan becomes the guy at quarterback they’ll be dealing with a lot of tough tasks especially once Big Ten play really kicks off. As long as the Wildcats don’t go winless things can only go up from here.                   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Just two days separate Northwestern from the onset of its 2023 season. In the very near future the Wildcats will go wheels up to Piscataway New Jersey to get set for their Week One matchup with the Rutgers Scarlet Knights. RU hasn’t had a winning season since 2014 so don’t fret if you’re unfamiliar with the program its NFL talent produced or roster for the upcoming season. To break down more of the Scarlet Knights Inside NU was lucky enough to be joined by Chris Tsakonas of ScarletNation.com 247Sports’ Rutgers affiliate site. Inside NU: Were you surprised by the decision to name Gavin Wimsatt the starter? What do you think he brings as a quarterback good and bad and do you expect him to perform better this year? Chris Tsakonas: I think I’m not surprised that he ultimately won out the starting job. I think in the long run this was a really highly touted four-star recruit out of high school. He kind of started really early in his career. Enrolled early in the 2021 season joined the team midseason got a couple of snaps. Last year started to play more and more and now has earned the starting job. I think he’s got a higher ceiling than Evan Simon who he was competing with a bit in the spring. I would say no not that surprised that he won out the job; I think he’s got the job as locked down as one could expect. I think that this is going to be a year where in terms of Gavin Wimsatt it’s gonna come down to: how accurate is he and can get that accuracy up? Can he make better decisions? Can he look more comfortable in the pocket compared to last year and can he just sort of adapt more to the speed of Big Ten football? I think if he can do that I’m not saying he’s going to be a finished product this year but I do think he has the potential to be a lot better than what he showed in his freshman year last year. INU: It was a Rutgers team last year in which the leading scrimmage yard performer was Aron Cruikshank at only 500 yards. With a lot of playmakers gone this season who do you expect to step up and do you think the production should be better overall? CT: I don’t think we’re really going to know the answer to “Are we going to see better production?” until we obviously see the team a bit because I think there are a lot of question marks. I think one name to keep an eye on is JaQuae Jackson someone who transferred up to DI had quite a few offers in the transfer portal this spring. Ultimately decided on Rutgers. I think he’s someone who could step in and have an immediate impact in his only season of eligibility. There are some younger receivers who are coming to the room as well. Chris Long is another guy that could step up. I’d say with the wide receivers it’s a little bit of question mark as to who specifically is going get the most snaps outside of like one or two guys just because there are a lot of new guys a lot of pieces leaving from last year. It’s a bit of a question mark. In terms of tight ends Johnny Langan is a veteran Big Ten guy. He’s now transitioning full-time to the tight end role; started as a quarterback and sort of had been used on a lot of short-yardage plays last couple of years. Looks a lot bigger looks a lot stronger. I’m pretty sure he listed about 240 pounds which is the heaviest he’s been listed. And then Shawn Bowman is just a really big body; comes in at around 260. He transferred in from Maine; he could be a little bit of a receiving threat. I think he’s also going to be helpful in the run game as an extra blocker that can just sort of create lanes. I really do think the strength of this offense is going to be in the running game. I think they’ve got a couple guys who can really run the rock. Sam Brown V before he went down with an injury last year was on pace to have a pretty good rookie season. He had a good freshman campaign before he unfortunately got hurt. He’s someone who has a lot of potential. Kyle Monangai and Aaron Young as well are going to be two guys that I think can be productive. I think the running back room out of this skill offensive positions is the deepest part. INU: Kirk Ciarrocca takes over as Rutgers’ offensive coordinator. It feels like running the ball has been the priority in his system — are you expecting that to be the identity for the Scarlet Knights this year? CT: I think it’s possible. I think it really depends on how the offensive looks the first couple of games. I think that if Rutgers feels that they’ve got something good going in the passing game it’s certainly possible that they try to lean on that more than they did last year. But at the same time the running back room is the strength of the offense on paper at least. So if the run game is effective I think it’s a strong possibility they’re gonna go with whatever works best. I do think ultimately the running back room looks a bit more talent-heavy than some of the other pass-catching groups on paper at least. So right now that’s what I would say. INU: Switching gears to the defensive side of the ball EDGE Aaron Lewis was really good last year. Do you expect him to pop off the page more in terms of sack production and do you think he’ll be that monster that Rutgers needs on D? CT: I think Aaron Lewis is a really really really good defensive lineman. I think he’s already had a tremendous career at Rutgers. I think he’s got the potential to take it to the next level this year and he’s someone who I think could really make an impact on that defensive line. I think he’s one of the better defensive linemen in the conference. If I were an opposing team and I was looking at battle in the trenches and I was saying “Who’s the guy we’ve got to key in on more than anyone else?” There are a lot of talented players on that defensive line. I’m not saying he’s the only guy by any means but he would probably be on the top of my chart; “this is an impact player that we’ve got to find a way to contain.” I think if he’s running loose and dominating line of scrimmage that’s gonna be a good day for Rutgers’ defense.” INU: In the back-end it feels like a bit of a transition without Christian Braswell Avery Young and Christian Izien. Who do you think is going to need to step up and lead the secondary? CT: They do bring a lot of continuity back. Two guys in particular that stand out top of my mind are Max Melton and Robert Longerbeam. These are both guys that are veterans of the program. They’ve been really impact guys on the corners. I think having that continuity and that talent back is going to be huge. There are some other players that have come in from the transfer portal: Eric Rogers Flip Dixon as well. You’ve got other returnees coming back in Shaquan Loyal and Kessawn Abraham. So there are a few guys that can really make an impact. I do think just talking about the defense as a whole I don’t think that there’s necessarily a weak spot that I can think of. I think this is a defense that at all three levels is a strong unit certainly on paper and I do think that’s gonna translate on the field. They’ve also got continuity in the coaching side of things with defensive coordinator Joe Harasymiak coming back for another year. I do think that is going to be a benefit and I think that this Rutgers defense has the potential to really make some noise in the Big Ten. INU: What do you think Rutgers will emphasize against Northwestern and how well do you think Greg Schiano’s team will execute that plan? CT: On the offensive side it’s going to be: don’t turn the ball over. I think it’ll be number one just because that was something that at times really killed Rutgers I go back for instance — it’s obviously a very different matchup — but against Michigan there was a sequence in the second half with three interceptions on the first three drives. Rutgers at the time was really in the game with Michigan. Michigan sort of ran away with it after that. The defense was constantly on the field from those three picks to defend short fields. That’s the kind of thing that Rutgers struggled with at times. If Rutgers can avoid turnovers and just play smart football offensively I think that’s gonna be a big help. Then just don’t keep the defense on the field most of the game. If the defense has the usual amount of rest as a defense that is going to be pretty tough for Northwestern and a lot of other Big Ten teams to deal with. I think that that was really the big thing for Rutgers in that respect. On the defensive side I think one other thing is no matter who’s starting for Northwestern at quarterback I think first and second downs are gonna be huge. I think if Rutgers can contain the run game and force Northwestern to pass on a lot of those third-and-long situations I think that’s going put Rutgers in a very advantageous position. I do think that could play into what Rutgers does well defensively. Those would be my keys; I think if Rutgers plays good fundamental football they’re gonna be in a good spot. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Being the record holder of an impressive feat will get you recognized by many. Being the record holder of an infamous one will get you recognized by more. At least that is the case for Northwestern and its drought of winning football games on this side of the Atlantic.  Among teams in Division I the ‘Cats already have the claim on the longest active losing streak secured (11; Nevada and South Florida are next both at 10). But what’s more is that NU’s last win was in Ireland against Nebraska in Week Zero of last season. All this to say that if you search for the team’s last victory on American soil you’ll need to pinpoint Week Seven of 2021 — mid-October of Ryan Hilinski’s junior year. Your eyes don’t deceive you. By the time the ‘Cats take the field in Piscataway New Jersey they’ll have gone 23 months without earning a win on their own continent. That’s the type of accomplishment you try to hide from the Guinness World Record reporters. The intention of this article is not to underscore the already well-publicized fact that NU is in the midst of a brutal losing streak — quite the opposite actually. This Friday just two days before Northwestern kicks off its 2023 campaign why don’t we relive the squad’s last win in the United States? Chalk it up to a manifestation for Sunday. Coincidentally that Week Seven win was against none other than Northwestern’s pending opponent: Rutgers. The Scarlet Knights and the Wildcats entered the 2021 matchup each under significantly different circumstances. Rutgers fresh off three straight losses to ranked opponents sat at .500. A victory would put the Knights back on track with a winning record and the toughest part of their schedule out of the way a bowl game not out of the question. NU was playing for less and had more luck on its side. Staring down a 2-3 record and a flurry of formidable Big Ten opponents the ‘Cats were coming off a bye week which was preceded by a Week Five shellacking courtesy of Nebraska. To make a long story short this game had the opportunity to propel Rutgers toward a coveted late-season extra contest while Northwestern was well-positioned to be a mid-season spoiler. The ‘Cats hosted the afternoon game donning a purple uniform and white helmets to complement. Big-time plays were the name of the game and we got our first one hardly 30 seconds into the game. Hilinski launched a near-50-yard bomb on a play fake that sent a relatively well-occupied Ryan Field into a frenzy (ah what once was…). Still this is Northwestern football we’re talking about and the drive ended with a Charlie Kuhbander missed field goal.  It wasn’t until later in the quarter that scoring opened as Malik Washington — who transferred to the University of Virginia this offseason — took a slant over the middle to the house. The effort was impressive given that his 45 yards after catch included a nasty truck move against a Rutgers defender who looked sizably bigger than the then-junior wideout. The quarter wrapped at 7-0 NU. Aside from an awkward flea flicker near the end of the period between Evan Hull and Hilinski which led to a (recovered) fumble and an ocean of jerseys on the grass the game was off to a smooth start for the home side. The Scarlet Knights equalized in the second quarter largely enabled by a few plays that Cam Mitchell botched. Rutgers’ Noah Vedral lofted a 45-yard jump ball to Bo Melton that he corralled over a scrambling Mitchell. Later in the drive after a Bryce Gallagher sack Vedral summoned his inner Patrick Mahomes before completing a jump pass on third-and-12. Seconds later Vedral found a wide open teammate in the endzone who dusted Mitchell. Luckily some impressive moves after the catch from NU wideouts put the ‘Cats right back in the red zone. From there Hilinski nailed Marshall Lang for a touchdown and Northwestern extended its lead to 14-7 going into the half. Quarter Three was a forgettable one. Featuring four punts an unsuccessful fourth down attempt and a missed field goal neither team got on the board.  In opposition to what we saw in 2022 the ‘Cats managed to actually extend their lead in the fourth quarter. A methodical drive from Hilinski and Co. with roughly seven minutes left in the game resulted in a touchdown deepening the Scarlet Knights’ deficit 21-7. A pair of big sacks including one from Samdup Miller on Rutgers’ last-ditch fourth down attempt sealed the deal.  In all Hilinski went 18-for-33 with two touchdown passes and 267 yards in the air. Andrew Clair was the ‘Cats’ leading rusher averaging over five yards per carry. Stephon Robinson Jr. paved the way among wideouts totaling 115 yards on the day. Oh how times have changed. Northwestern notched 402 total yards on the day and it especially outperformed Rutgers on the ground — 135 to 63. RU’s outing was marred by penalties as the Knights racked up 90 yellow yards to the ‘Cats’ 50.  Northwestern’s win in that Week Seven game would be its last for the season as it went on to drop six straight. It would also mark the team’s last victory on American soil for the foreseeable future. The ‘Cats have the chance to reset their losing streak to zero if they can nab a win against Rutgers on Sunday. No task seems small nowadays but this will serve as one of the better chances Northwestern gets to conclude what’s been a miserable period of American history. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Northwestern opened up the post-Pat Fitzgerald era in Piscataway against Rutgers on Sunday afternoon and though the team wanted to change the script from last year’s 1-11 season it didn’t start of well falling 24-7 to the Scarlet Knights. Even with the resounding loss there were a few positives; but it will be out-shaded by countless negatives as Northwestern tries to dig itself out of the basement of college football. Stock Up A.J. Henning The Michigan transfer was one of the most notable players to come into the program this past offseason and expectations were that he would immediately slide in as the team’s top wide receiver. He backed it up on the first drive reeling in a 26-yard pass from Ben Bryant while being hit by two Rutgers defenders. While he only got minimal touches the rest of the half Henning provided Northwestern with a glimpse of how meaningful he can be for this offense. His first target of the second half was another deep ball that Bryant slightly overthrew but the wide receiver was open. He finished the game with four receptions for 42 yards on eight targets and it is clear Henning will be used in multiple ways throughout the season. Northwestern’s secondary Whether it was Garnett Hollis Theran Johnson Rod Heard II Coco Azema or Devin Turner the Northwestern secondary was a bright spot on defense. After letting up a passing touchdown on the opening drive they performed well in Piscataway holding Gavin Wimsatt to 163 yards passing. A lot of the time the secondary was let out to dry as Northwestern pass rushers failed to get to Rutgers’ quarterback Gavin Wimsatt. The potential is there; for a unit that lost Cam Mitchell A.J. Hampton and Jeremiah Lewis during the offseason the new starters had some good moments in the opener. If they are able to stay healthy and continue to develop the secondary will yet again be a strength. Bryce Gallagher After earning All-Big Ten accolades last season and tallying over 100 tackles Gallagher backed these recognitions up against Rutgers finishing with 19 total tackles setting a new career high. The Northwestern defense was on and off today but Gallagher was all over the place. Similar to last season he should be the Wildcats’ leading tackler and one of its best players yet again. Honorable Mentions: Cam Johnson the rush defense Rutgers’ gameday experience press box hot dogs Stock Down Northwestern’s defense on third and fourth downs The X-factor early on in the game was the defense’s inability to get off the field on numerous third and fourth downs. While the ‘Cats were able to stop the Scarlet Knights early on Rutgers had three fourth down conversions on their first drive resulting in a touchdown from Gavin Wimsatt to Ian Strong. On the second drive Wimsatt added a rushing touchdown. If Northwestern was able to make plays on late downs it could have been a different ballgame early on. But Rutgers kept the Northwestern offense off the field with a total of 32 plays in their first two drives. The defense had a few good series but the late down conversions killed them throughout the game. The offensive line Going into the year it was obvious Northwestern was going to have a new offensive line and in its first showing it did not perform well. Specifically in pass protection the Wildcats failed to give Ben Bryant time to throw; Bryant was sacked five times and one of his interceptions resulted from a botched snap and poor protection along with the veteran trying to make a play. Northwestern was able to move the ball at times but could not convert and Rutgers was able to get to Bryant many times in key situations. Rushing-wise Northwestern had 22 carries for 12 yards — and Brendan Sullivan contributed 11 of those in the last three minutes. Nobody could get it going on the ground and a lot of that is because of the line allowing Rutgers defenders to meet Northwestern rushers in the backfield. Mike Bajakian’s gameplan Northwestern has an offense with new names but Mike Bajakian did not help them on Sunday. The distribution between runs and passes was way too lopsided with Northwestern having less than 20 designed run plays and there were many pass designs where receivers were easily blanketed and Bryant could not find them. Bajakian was almost a casualty at the end of last season for Northwestern who had the Big Ten’s worst offense and today the offense was not any better even with the new names.

Share this story The eternal question asked is whether Northwestern’s season could be worse than its offseason. Apparently it can. In its season opener Northwestern (0-1 0-1 B1G) was no match for Rutgers (1-0 1-0 B1G) falling 24-7 in its first game with David Braun as the head coach. Nothing went well for the Wildcats as the Scarlet Knights possessed the ball for almost 40 minutes.  For Greg Schiano’s team Gavin Wimsatt completed 17 of his 29 passes for 163 yards and a touchdown. On the ground Kyle Monangai led a balanced rushing attack with 49 yards and a score on 14 carries. Isaiah Washington led the Scarlet Knights’ receiving core with 36 yards on four catches. Rutgers’ defense played even better racking up five sacks in its shutout victory. Deion Jennings led the team with nine tackles. In his first start as a Wildcat Ben Bryant went 20-for-35 passing for 169 yards and throwing two interceptions. Transfers A.J. Henning and Cam Johnson led the air attack combining for eight catches and 87 yards. The running game was nonexistent with Brendan Sullivan leading the team in rushing despite only playing the last two minutes of the game. On the defensive side Bryce Gallagher led the ‘Cats with 19 tackles a career-high. The ‘Cats won the toss and deferred booting it off to the Scarlet Knights to start the 2023 season. NU forced a third down but Monangai was able to pick up a fresh set of down on an inside run. The Wildcats had the Scarlet Knights in a third-and-long but a completion just short of the sticks and another inside run put RU into Northwestern territory. On its third set of downs Rutgers once again picked up a fourth-down conversion as the ‘Cats could not get off the field. The Scarlet Knights capped off the 16-play drive on a beautiful toe tap in the back of the endzone by Ian Strong to go ahead 7-0. After the kickoff Northwestern’s new offense appeared to find its grove. Cincinnati transfer Ben Bryant found former Michigan wide receiver A.J. Henning for 26 yards to put the ‘Cats inside RU territory. However the Wildcats could not capitalize on the chunk play having three straight incompletions and being forced to punt. RU’s offense continued to move the ball against the Wildcats’ defense. The Scarlet Knights picked up 19 yards finding the soft spot in Cover 2 to get the ball out to midfield. Rutgers converted another fourth down and Wimsatt sailed his pass over his initial target but Strong came back and made a diving catch for another fresh set of downs. It was all Rutgers at the end of the first frame leading 7-0. The Scarlet Knights continued to have their way with the Wildcats converting another third-and-long before Wimsatt barreled into the endzone to extend Rutgers’ lead to 14-0. It was RU’s second drive of the game and its second 16-play drive. When Northwestern’s offense saw the field again it was short lived. After NU picked up an initial first down the Wildcats were forced to punt again; however Jeff Genyk reached into his bag of tricks and dialed up a fake punt. Hunter Renner completed the pass to Rod Heard II but he was marked just short of the line to gain turning the ball back over to Rutgers inside NU territory. Rutgers moved into the red zone after a questionable defensive pass interference call on Garnett Hollis Jr. gifted the Scarlet Knights a free 15 yards. However NU’s defense was finally able to get off the field and hold RU to three pushing the ‘Cats’ deficit to three scores. Bryant settled in on his third drive finding Cam Johnson on a strike across the middle for a fresh set of downs. After a false start sent NU backward Bryant found Jacob Gill to recoup the yards lost and kept it himself to pick up the first down. That put the Wildcats inside Rutgers territory. However the ‘Cats’ drive stalled and Bryant’s fourth-down pass to Henning fell short giving the ball back to the Scarlet Knights. After a three-and-out for Rutgers Northwestern tried to run a two-minute drill. Spoiler alert: it went poorly. Cam Porter could not pick up the first down in a short-yardage situation and a botched snap forced Bryant to throw up a prayer as he was walloped landing the ball into the waiting arms of Max Melton for the easy interception. Rutgers was unable to capitalize on the turnover with Jai Patel‘s 38-yard field goal bouncing off the upright. That kept holding Rutgers’ lead at 17-0 going into the half time locker room. Kirk Ciarrocca’s offense dominated time of possession in the first half staying on the field for over 24 minutes. Additionally Rutgers converted eight of 11 third and fourth down opportunities while the ‘Cats went just 1-for-7 in those situations. Out of the locker room Northwestern’s offense did nothing in its opening possession going three and out. Rutgers did not do anything either sending a punt right back to NU. After another Northwestern punt Rutgers drove deep into ‘Cats territory aided by a 20-yard catch and run by Monangai who punched it in to push the Rutgers lead to 24-0. Northwestern went three-and-out again including a near-interception by Bryant. On its next offensive possession Bryant picked up 15 yards with his leg but tossed an interception on a fade to Johnson. The ensuing drive a holding penalty set the Wildcats behind the sticks and a big hit jarred a deep ball out of Johnson’s hands. In pure garbage time Northwestern’s offense started to move the ball completing a strike to Johnson and multiple passes to Henning. However two sacks including a strip sack sent the punting unit out again. In one of the lone bright spots for NU the Wildcats recovered a muffed punt.  With the clock nearly zero Sullivan and multiple second-teamers took the final snaps. The second-team offense worked the ball into the red zone for the first time in the game and finally found the endzone with 20 seconds remaining when Sullivan connected with Caleb Komolafe for the touchdown. It was long over by the time he reached paydirt as Rutgers cruised to a 24-7 victory.

The writer with the best overall record on the year will win $20 worth of Buffalo Joe’s which adds a little flavor to this. The contending field could narrow right away as our staff is fairly split on what will happen at SHI Stadium this afternoon. The one thing everyone can agree on? This should be close. Iggy Dowling: Northwestern 16 Rutgers 13 This is a program that has built its brand off winning games it wasn’t supposed to and one that has routinely lost games inexplicably. Well considering the offseason this team went through it cannot possibly get more Northwestern than this. Nothing like winning your first North American game in 687 days by beating the team you last faced... 687 days ago. But seriously I think NU’s defense will be able to put together a good game because Gavin Wimsatt and the Rutgers passing attack won’t be able to exploit the Wildcat linebackers in coverage. They’ll get to do what they do best — stuff the run — and Ben Bryant will play a mistake-free game to come away with the win to open the Braun Era. Bradley Locker: Rutgers 24 Northwestern 21 There’s a part of me that definitely thinks Northwestern can win this game. After all the Wildcats seemed incredibly prepared and executed well against Nebraska in the opener last year; plus this team is clearly motivated to go out play and succeed after being invigorated by David Braun. However this game might feel more like a mid-year contest rather than a unique beginning (as playing in Dublin provided) negating some of the aura of a fresh start. Despite a pretty close affair Northwestern’s largely nascent coaching staff and new configuration of faces experiences growing pains and narrowly misses out on a win. I don’t really trust either of these teams but Kirk Ciarrocca has experience beating Northwestern on the ground — that could very well continue against a below-average defensive line and be just enough for RU to control the clock and prevail. David Gold: Northwestern 24 Rutgers 13 There is only one lock in sports: when a team plays its first game under an interim head coach it is going to win. The Wildcats after an inexplicable offseason will rally around David Braun to win his first game at the helm of the program. Ben Bryant will get the start and find both Cam Johnson and A.J. Henning for scores quickly displaying the new additions to NU this offseason. The ‘Cats’ defense will do just enough to hold off Gavin Wimsatt and the Scarlet Knights offense which already lacks talent and give Northwestern the win. The Wildcats are not a good football team but Rutgers is even worse. Ethan Segall: Rutgers 15 Northwestern 10 You thought you missed Big Ten football huh? Think again. For reasons unbeknownst to me  this game was deemed deserving of a Sunday afternoon primetime slot perfectly situated for the entire nation to soak in a matchup of what many prognosticators forecast to be the bottom two teams in the conference. To celebrate the occasion I predict America will be treated to a defensive slugfest where the winning team kicks five field goals. On a more tangible level I genuinely expect the team to come out with a fire in their belly and play hard in the first game of the David Braun era. I wouldn’t be surprised if the ‘Cats won this one but after getting my hopes up last season I’ve learned my lesson and am choosing to emotionally hedge by projecting a loss. Jake Mozarsky: Rutgers 23 Northwestern 20 On Pound the Talk I had a higher score prediction but after realizing these offenses were two of the worst in the Big Ten last year I can’t expect a slugfest tomorrow. While I do think Northwestern will be better with Ben Bryant at the helm the biggest X-factor tomorrow is Northwestern’s defensive line against Rutgers’ rush attack led by new offensive coordinator Kirk Ciarrocca; Ciarrocca led Minnesota to over 300 yards on the ground last year when the Gophers thrashed the ‘Cats and tomorrow this will be key. While the Scarlet Knights do not have a top rushing threat they get it done as a group and Northwestern loses a close one to open the season. John Olsen: Rutgers 12 Northwestern 10 I legitimately could not name a single player on the Scarlet Knights’ roster but I still have more faith in those (as far as I’m concerned) NPCs than this Northwestern team.  Ascher Levin: Northwestern 21 Rutgers 17 Even though it has been a turbulent offseason for the Wildcats I have them coming out on top against Rutgers. The Scarlet Knights had one of the worst offenses in college football last year and their starter for the last five games Gavin Wimsatt struggled with accuracy: only completing 44.8% of his passes. This matchup is favorable for Northwestern’s defense since they will be able to focus more heavily on run defense. On the offensive side of the ball transfers Ben Bryant and A.J. Henning will play an important role. Northwestern struggled immensely with turnovers last year and Bryant’s decision-making will greatly improve their numbers in the turnover battle. Henning’s ability to stretch the field and create explosive plays will open up other facets of the offense. While Rutgers’ defense is their strength Bryant Henning and the rest of the starters will do just enough for Northwestern to start the season 1-0. Natalie Wells: Rutgers 23 Northwestern 20 All eyes are on the offseason transfers — A.J. Henning will look to become Ben Bryant’s favorite target on NU’s new-look offense. I think Henning will notch a rushing touchdown flaunting the shiftiness that earned him an All-Big Ten selection as a return man at Michigan. Bryant should play a conservative if not uninspiring brand of football as he seeks to put together solid drives during his debut in the purple and white. But Rutgers quarterback Gavin Wimsatt has impressed his coaches this offseason showing growth after a rough five games as a starter in 2022. I think the Scarlet Knights will have the last laugh as sophomore kicker Jai Patel will boot the game-winning field goal. Interim head coach David Braun’s tenure with the ‘Cats will begin with a heart-wrenching loss. Ashleigh Provoost: Northwestern 14 Rutgers 13 It’s hard to have solid expectations for either of these teams; both come into the 2023 season with coaching changes and a bit of uncertainty. I see this as a low-scoring game relying mostly on defensive play. I don’t have faith in either of these offenses to be honest–I see maybe an opening drive TD from Rutgers and then Wimsatt struggling to lead his team into NU territory from there. Hopefully Ben Bryant can take Northwestern down the field for two scores and satisfy all of my hopes and dreams by being able to connect with A.J. Henning in the end zone for both. I think this is one of the more winnable games of the Wildcats’ schedule. Although it may be a close one I can see them eking out this win. Brendan Preisman: Rutgers 17 Northwestern 10 If you liked Nebraska-Minnesota you are going to love Northwestern-Rutgers. Both of these teams were extremely poor offensively last year and growing pains are likely to continue for both squads. Rutgers’ guy under center is Gavin Wimsatt a junior who played sparingly last year with six starts. And while he’s impressed the coaches he’s got a long way to go to become a great quarterback as last year’s 45% completion percentage can attest. This is going to be a slog of a game likely decided by turnovers and considering Northwestern was a -18 in that department last season that doesn’t bode well for the Wildcats. I think it’ll be a tight game but ultimately there are just too many questions about Northwestern for the team to start the David Braun era with a win. Sammy Krimstein: Rutgers 20 Northwestern 17 The first game of the David Braun era carries plenty of importance for the Wildcats. As they look to move past the controversy that shook the college football world during the offseason a Week One win would be crucial for setting the season’s tone. Their opening matchup against Rutgers is certainly winnable but I have the Wildcats coming up just short. Although both teams struggled mightily on offense in 2022 a strength for Rutgers was their rushing attack despite a midseason injury to lead back Samuel Brown V. With Brown back in the mix in 2023 complemented by Kyle Monangai who performed well in Brown’s absence last season Rutgers’ run game matches up great against a Northwestern run defense that finished dead last in the Big Ten a year ago. Still Wildcat fans should expect to see improvement offensively – hopefully some big plays from the notable newcomers Ben Bryant A.J. Henning and Cam Johnson.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story For the fourth season in a row Northwestern will have a new quarterback under center in Week One. Ben Bryant was named the Wildcats’ starter on Sunday morning ESPN’s Pete Thamel reported. Bryant who transferred from Cincinnati following spring practice beat out Brendan Sullivan for the starting gig. NU will be the third team the sixth-year will have started for. Sources: Northwestern will start Ben Bryant at quarterback at Rutgers today. Bryant is a transfer from Cincinnati and has 22 career starts combined from UC and Eastern Michigan. In 11 starts for the Bearcats last season Bryant threw for 2732 yards 21 touchdowns and seven interceptions. He completed 61.2% of his passes including four games with a completion rate over 70%. A true pocket passer Bryant rarely took off as a runner.  Bryant takes the reins of a Northwestern offense that floundered in 2022. The ‘Cats found themselves at the bottom of college football in points scored yards gained and turnover margin. NU’s 17 interceptions fell in the bottom three of all Power Five schools in 2022 so Bryant will need to protect the football better than his predecessors. The ‘Cats’ last two transfer quarterbacks Hunter Johnson and Ryan Hilinski both flamed out under center for NU so the pressure is on Bryant and offensive coordinator Mike Bajakian to not make it a third swing-and-miss for the Wildcats. Northwestern will kick off its season this afternoon taking on the Rutgers Scarlet Knights in Piscataway New Jersey. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Driving through northern New Jersey you see lots of highways and lots of gas stations and lots of swamps. Suburbia is nestled away inside tall pine trees well out of sight. I associate it with friends encountering comically-bad NJ Transit train delays and drivers cursing each other out on the way to work while my dad associates it with Bill Parcells’ coarse Jersey accent screeching just a few miles down the road from the Mill Creek Marsh in Secaucus. It’s not the most appealing of sights sounds or smells which is why the Garden State is America’s right armpit. People clown on New Jersey New Yorkers like me especially. It’s warranted. But the ugliness that Jersey offers is the zit that helps form the Tri-State Area’s distinct uniquely beautiful face. Harping on it is what brings people closer to that identity. I’d like to think that the Big Ten West is America’s left armpit. It’s hideous disgusting and on the verge of extinction but it’s also a part of Northwestern’s identity that’s embraced more often than not. When watching Minnesota and Nebraska play a low-scoring Thursday night game that the word “chaotic” criminally undersells pride came to the forefront. The general reaction was less “Wow that was some weird football” and more like “Wow Rutgers-Northwestern could be even more hilarious in three days... and it’s on CBS!” Ironically in the wake of the hazing and racism scandals surrounding Northwestern’s football program this summer that on-field sloppiness was a solace that many members of the NU community seemed to chase. Even if the Wildcats played ugly football in a tight loss to Rutgers which appeared to be the worst team on Northwestern’s conference slate there would be some positives to help the community recover. Phrases like “move past” and “move forward” have frequently been thrown around because anything good would mark a leap in the right direction. Whether they’ve happened emotionally or physically there have been countless drives to SHI Stadium through a traffic-congested northern New Jersey highway since July. A pursuit of that Big Ten West stench couldn’t come soon enough because it emitted normalcy and unity. Just ask David Braun who said that Sunday was “the lightest” he had felt since taking over as the interim head coach. Unfortunately armpits tend to stink most when it’s 90 degrees outside. There really isn’t a point in psychoanalyzing what happened on Sunday afternoon since the same thought process and conclusion are going to be carried out and reached over and over again for the next 12 weeks. There’s also not much to say that isn’t already obvious. The Scarlet Knights dominated Northwestern on both sides of the line of scrimmage which rendered the positives the ‘Cats had as almost meaningless. It’s difficult to even identify three opponents on the schedule that NU has a better chance of beating than Rutgers which only makes the 24-7 loss more discouraging. A few schematic adjustments will not be enough to get Northwestern out of this hole. Everyone knows that. There’s a decent chance that the on-field results become even worse in the coming weeks and the worst part is that none of it really matters. Whether the Wildcats were to win 49-0 against UTEP or lose their next 11 games the level of apathy from the fanbase would probably remain close to where it is right now. Even if Sunday’s positives — like A.J. Henning’s separation and Devin Turner’s physicality — continue to manifest themselves the rest of the way it’s unlikely that the plan for 2024 and beyond changes dramatically. The Rutgers loss should serve as a strong reminder that moving forward requires growth which is not a flash in the pan. It takes time both on the field and off of it. Righting the ship and truly moving away from something as monumental as the hazing scandal in just eight weeks — or even four months — is impossible for any team to fully do.  Instead of trying to chase a familiar identity in a season that means little Northwestern needs to build the foundation of a new one to set its transition in motion. Schematically NU showed signs of doing that. The air attack seemed much more dangerous than last year with Cam Johnson and Henning as threats Ben Bryant had some good moments and the secondary played with great discipline on deeper routes. The defense also looked better in the second half than it did in the first.  Those are small steps in the right direction and they’re each worth appreciating. But when competitive football in Big Ten play appears to be light years away it’s immensely difficult to consider them as such. Much of the groundwork is going to be done off the field away from the public eye: continuing to build a new locker room environment adjusting to Braun Braun adapting to the rigors of the Big Ten winning back a portion of the fanbase that’s now apathetic players coming to terms with the fact that they still represent a vehicle to success for an administration they heavily criticized. It’s an unenviable task. The action on coming Saturdays isn’t going to expedite or slow that long process. From the perspective of fans who haven’t gone through the 1980s it might feel like walking through the desert in a drought (which is not unlike what Piscataway physically felt like on Sunday). There’s no right or wrong way to deal with it; everyone’s connection to the program is unique. All there is to know is that the drive through North Jersey appears to be slower than the George Washington Bridge at the end of Labor Day Weekend. It will wreak for a while. Football alone even if it gives off a more familiar smell isn’t going to wipe the stench away. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After an offseason that turned the Northwestern football program upside-down the team had a chance to wash away some of the summer negativity with a strong performance on the road. Unfortunately despite the fact that Pat Fitzgerald was not on the sideline for the first time in 17 seasons the on-field product looked all too similar to last year’s disappointing campaign. With the chance to move to 1-0 and pick up a crucial conference win early in the season the Wildcats fell flat losing 24-7 to Rutgers. Here are five things we learned in the season opener: The defensive line has to step up It didn’t take long for Northwestern fans to muffle any optimism they may have held headed into the season as on the opening drive the Scarlet Knights marched down the field on a 16-play 75-yard drive that culminated in a touchdown. The second drive was no better as Rutgers put together another long drive this one totaling 80 yards en route to another trip to the end zone. By the end of the first quarter Rutgers led the time of possession battle with a comical 13:34 to 1:26 advantage not to mention the 14-0 lead on the scoreboard. The root of these struggles was a lack of penetration up front. While I won’t point all of the blame for Northwestern’s inability to get off the field at the defensive line (the Scarlet Knights converted seven third and fourth downs on those first two drives alone) throughout the afternoon Rutgers was able to control the clock and the game flow by imposing physicality on the ground. When Gavin Wimsatt dropped back to pass the line failed to generate pressure even on designed blitzes. Ultimately the Wildcats did not record a sack even though the run defense stiffened in the later stage of the game. The other side of the trenches must improve as well Unlike Northwestern’s zero-sack performance the Rutgers front was able to get to the quarterback early and often. Rutgers recorded five sacks on the afternoon and several more QB hits and hurries. Although this group of offensive linemen is a new combination for the Wildcats the unit struggled in both the running and passing facets of the offense. Non-quarterbacks managed just 14 yards on 10 designed carries although to be fair Northwestern conceding two early scores put the team in a hole that allowed Rutgers pass rushers to tee off in expected pass situations. Regardless the departures of both starting tackles from a season ago including All-American Peter Skoronski was felt almost immediately. There were communication errors that led to free rushers and quarterback Ben Bryant was consistently forced to speed up his progressions leading to some untimely errors. Things must get better and fast or the results may be dire. Later in the night after the game ended I watched “Zodiac” a truly unnerving movie that scared me to my core. Thinking about this offensive line facing off against Chop Robinson and Penn State in a few weeks is even scarier. We saw a concerted effort to get the ball into the hands of transfer playmakers Eighteen of the 39 available targets on Sunday afternoon were funneled to two wide receivers: transfers Cam Johnson (10 targets) and A.J. Henning (eight targets plus two rush attempts and punt return duties). The two pass-catchers coming from Arizona State and Michigan respectively were a bright spot for the team. Johnson finished with four receptions for 45 yards but looked sharp coming in and out of his breaks and I thought he played far bigger than his 6-foot-even frame. Henning finished the day with four catches for 42 yards and his world-class speed looked as advertised. For a receiver room that did not see any options accumulate 700 yards last season there is reason for excitement. Both seniors should continue to see a large portion of work in the passing game although I expect more work for the tight ends in future weeks as well as the addition of Bryce Kirtz who did not play Sunday.  While we’re shouting out some individual players who flashed on Sunday I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention both Garnett Hollis Jr. and Devin Turner who both showed signs of stellar play in the secondary. Whichever quarterback is under center will have a short leash As most assumed Cincinnati transfer Ben Bryant was named the starter for the opener and Bryant’s debut in purple was up-and-down ultimately ending on a sour note. Bryant finished the day 20-for-35 for 169 yards and two interceptions. The offensive line did Bryant no favors but with a goose egg on the board the starter was yanked late in the game in favor of Brendan Sullivan who led the team on a short drive ending with a touchdown to avoid the shutout. Before the score in the closing seconds of the game things were looking ugly. The only causes for smiling in the second half ahead of the Caleb Komolafe touchdown were a very cute picture CBS showed of David Braun’s newborn daughter Blake (congrats to the Braun family!) and a riveting promo for a new season of Survivor (90-minute episodes!). Sullivan’s touchdown added one more item to that list and made a compelling case that he should trot out with the starting offense on Saturday against UTEP. Bryant had some nice throws in his action including an opening-drive dot down the field to Henning and a bullet over the middle of the field to Johnson that zipped right past the Scarlet Knight linebacker. The two interceptions however were poor decisions and momentum killers. Sullivan offers more mobility and playmaking but regardless of who is at the helm Sunday proved that the QB competition was not limited to the offseason and could linger throughout the year depending on who has a hot hand. Braun and Bajakian were aggressive in the pursuit of big plays Even setting aside the fake punt in the second quarter which has already led to discourse on whether it was a good decision with bad execution or a poor decision that was executed nearly well enough to work we saw a different type of aggression on the offensive side of the ball. The Wildcats took several shots down the field but were just 2-for-9 on passes that traveled 15 or more air yards. What is even more surprising was the frequency of passing we witnessed for a team whose identity has traditionally been rooted in running the football. On first down I counted 20 called passing plays to a mere four run designs a truly shocking discrepancy for a team who was willing to run the ball eight or nine straight plays a season ago. Personally I like this style of aggressiveness and it suggests an analytics-forward approach from the gameplanners and playcallers. The process is correct even if the results were not there so even if the run/pass rate inches closer to 50/50 (which it should) it would be disappointing if Bajakian got cold feet and returned to a predictable run-run-pass play sequence we saw throughout 2022.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Week One has come and gone for Northwestern and although we expected some early hiccups in the early stages of the David Braun regime the 24-7 loss to Rutgers was disappointing nonetheless. Now Northwestern (0-1 0-1 B1G) has a chance at redemption against UTEP (1-1 0-1 C-USA) as the Wildcats and Miners are set to face off for the first time in program history. Here are some crucial matchups to look out for on Saturday: UTEP’s offensive line vs. Northwestern’s defensive line The UTEP offensive line has been remarkably up-and-down through two contests mostly depending on what type of play is called. On designed runs when the line is allowed to maul forward and set the physical tone the Miners have seen a lot of success. Last week against Incarnate Word UTEP ran the ball up and down the field for 329 total yards in large part due to running back Deion Hankins. However in pass protection the unit has struggled to keep pockets clean an issue that was especially noticeable in the opener against Jacksonville State. Northwestern’s defensive line struggled against Rutgers. Although run lanes tightened up in the second half Gavin Wimsatt had all day long to dice apart the secondary with the boys in purple unable to hurry or spook the quarterback. If Northwestern’s line steps up on early downs they can force the Miners into less favorable passing situations where the offensive line will be forced to hold up. The Wildcats are on the hunt to capture their first sack of the season after being held without one in Piscataway. UTEP quarterback Gavin Hardison vs. Northwestern’s secondary First off it’s super odd that Northwestern opens the 2023 season facing two quarterbacks named Gavin. But hey here at Inside NU we have a prominent Gavin on staff so maybe there was just a boom of babies named Gavin circa 2001. Anyways I mentioned that the strength of UTEP’s offense has been the run game through two contests but the Miners’ signal caller is no slouch. Gavin Hardison possesses what those in the scouting community refer to as a “live arm.” In other words he can zing the ball like nobody’s business. His arm talent already has him in the discussion as a fringe-late round prospect in the NFL Draft. Check out this beauty from the Jacksonville State game (ignore the fact that the touchdown was later reversed after video review). What a strike from UTEP QB Gavin Hardison! pic.twitter.com/nlNvDAbB5e Hardison sometimes relies too much on his cannon of an arm trusting that he can fit balls into tight windows which can get him into trouble. That’s where the defense comes in. Against Rutgers the secondary stood out as a bright spot in an otherwise lackluster performance. Devin Turner was around the ball all day and with some smart disguises or well-executed zone coverages it would not be at all surprising to see him — or another member of the defensive backfield — snatch one out of the air to turn the tides of the game. UTEP’s Dana Dimel vs. Northwestern’s David Braun In terms of coaching experience the Miners certainly hold the advantage with Dimel having coached games at Wyoming Houston and UTEP across 12 seasons. He’s been the man in charge for 128 football games meanwhile David Braun on the other sideline has overseen just one — last week’s loss to Rutgers. Braun is surrounded by several assistants with in-game experience not to mention his own time as a defensive coordinator at North Dakota State but it is worth watching to see if Braun’s inexperience with some of his new responsibilities shows up in the margins. In a game that analysts project to be close (along with betting markets who favor the Miners by 1.5 points) key coaching decisions could be the difference. Braun does gain some advantage from his freshness to the position as a one-game sample size might leave UTEP unable to predict Braun’s decision-making. Unpredictability may be the key to capturing a win for the first time since last year’s opener in Ireland. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story I heard a lot of stuff this past weekend about how bad Northwestern football’s offense was but those critics must not have been watching the games I was. I mean they scored six goals in two games bringing their total to 20 on the season. Wait did you think I was talking about the FBS team? No no no. I’m talking about Northwestern women’s soccer. In Week Three the ‘Cats’ offense continued its dynamic run to start the season remaining on pace to break its single-season goal total. They’ve scored at least three goals in all but one game. If you want excitement this is your team. Let’s see what they cooked up this week. Aug. 31 vs. Boston University Northwestern started Week Three back on the lakeside at Martin Stadium this time inviting Boston University to bask on the shores. By the time 90 minutes had elapsed the ‘Cats gave felines an advantage in the age-old debate taking down the Terriers 3-0. Meg Boade was doing what she usually does in the 14th minute. After dribbling through most of the Boston defense she picked out Ella Hase right in front of the goal. By the time BU realized what was happening it was too late. The ball and the back of the net had already become close acquaintances and Hase had her third goal of the year to put Northwestern up 1-0.  Ella Hase BURIES her third  goal of the year!   pic.twitter.com/yJtSQ6RjIj The ‘Cats kept shooting but they weren’t able to come up with anything else before the half. In fact it took until the 82nd minute for them to notch another goal when first-year Megan Norkett took matters into her own hands. After collecting a long ball from Danika Austin Norkett put a BU defender in a blender to open a perfect path to the bin. She converted earning her first collegiate goal in the process. Megan Norkett tallies her first collegiate goal! Future looking bright   pic.twitter.com/Mz0XcMnQJl Four minutes later Boade added one of her own as she’s never one to miss out on the fun. With a flying scissor-kick that would make Bruce Lee proud she fired home Aurea del Carmen’s cross. .@megboade FLIES in to add one more for good measure!   pic.twitter.com/MbLNAHct8N If it wasn’t clear the ‘Cats were dominant the entire match. They out-shot the Terriers 19-3 while also being clinical defensively en route to their fourth shutout of the season. This stingy defending included a full-extension save from Reiley Fitzpatrick who seems to have the starting role all but locked up. There was no time to gloat though. Next up was a 2022 NCAA Tournament rematch against Vanderbilt. Sep. 3 at Vanderbilt For most offenses being without your (and the conference’s) leading goal scorer would be a major problem. Northwestern is not most offenses. Josie Aulicino went down against BU and consequently was out for the tussle against the Commodores. Northwestern still managed to score three goals. Del Carmen called first dibs on scoring and she did it all by herself. After collecting a loose ball just outside the box she unleashed a screamer curling it around the outstretched keeper. It was truly a jaw-dropping goal — see for yourself: GOLAZO! @aureadelcarmen pic.twitter.com/hi3A7O8Xdf Vandy equalized a few minutes later insisting that this one wasn’t going to be a walk in the park. That goal was the first let up by Northwestern in open play which was bound to happen at some point. The early-match scoring continued with another solo goal from outside the box this one coming from Boade. After winning a ball off a Vanderbilt fullback she saw her opportunity and fired a shot from long range catching the Commodore Keeper off her line. Defense ➡️Offense from @megboade pic.twitter.com/ojqIVNlQCM Two minutes later Northwestern had a corner and took full advantage. Hase found herself face-to-face with the ball and no one in between her and the goal. Unsurprisingly she made sure that the ball made itself nice and cozy in the back of the net. Set. Piece. Magic.   pic.twitter.com/I3G6QHZipZ At that point it seemed like the Wildcats were in a good spot and heading for a fourth straight victory. But the Commodores weren’t going down without a fight. Right after the half Courtney Johnson scored to bring Vanderbilt back within one. It seemed like Northwestern might be able to hold out following that but in the 85th minute Ella Eggleston found the equalizer.  While this one was a tie on the scoresheet the way it went down made it feel more like a loss. For the first time this season the ‘Cats were out-shot (13-7) and they also picked up more fouls than the Commodores. This was the first true test for the Wildcats and they faltered some. With one more week until Big Ten play they’ll need to lock in to ensure they’re in the best possible spot to contend in the conference. Moving Forward For the second time this season next up is another set of purple Wildcats. Weber State is coming to town with the matchup set for Sep. 7 at 7 p.m. CT. If you’re not able to watch on B1G+ you should tune in to a certain student-run radio station where yours truly will be on the call. After Weber State Northwestern will be travelling to Blacksburg to take on Virginia Tech. I’m not entirely sure what a Hokie is but I’m pretty sure a Wildcat is cooler. Sep. 10 at 12:30 p.m. CT will let us know for sure.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story College football is back! And after an offseason filled with tons of turmoil and turnover at nearly every Big Ten school Week One was...eerily similar to last year. Everywhere you looked it was the conference’s traditional powers reasserting themselves. And in the last year of divisional play the Big Ten is once again summoning all of its traditions. The Big Ten East has multiple national title contenders and the Big Ten West has Wisconsin and Iowa covering up a complete dumpster fire behind them. There’s reason to hope for quite a few teams but there’s also reason to worry for almost as many. Without further ado let’s kick off a new season of Around the Big Ten. Ohio State’s offense looks off It is the year 2023 and the Iowa Hawkeyes have outscored the Ohio State Buckeyes so far this season. The reason for this is simple: after over half a decade of great quarterback play Ohio State may finally be regressing to the mean. Kyle McCord a top-3 quarterback in the Class of 2021 is finally receiving his moment after CJ Stroud’s departure and the lights looked a little bright for him against Indiana. The Buckeyes won 23-3 thanks to a horribly anemic Indiana offense but McCord had some rough moments going 20-for-33 for 239 yards and an interception. Devin Brown a top-5 quarterback in the Class of 2022 pushed McCord all summer and very easily could have been named the starter. If McCord continues to struggle especially as the schedule gets tougher fans could start calling for Brown. This is arguably the most important season of Ryan Day’s tenure at Ohio State and with average QB play it might just be his toughest. The Age of Allar looks appealing Penn State almost certainly will get better QB play than the Buckeyes this year. That’s thanks to Drew Allar who looked magnificent in Penn State’s 38-15 dismantling of West Virginia. In his first career start the sophomore went 21-of-29 for 325 yards and three scores including a 72-yard strike to KeAndre Lambert-Smith on the first drive of the game. Admittedly it was a home game for the Nittany Lions against a below-average Big 12 squad. But Allar looked poised and made a lot of good plays and he’ll have three more weeks before going up against his first real test in Iowa. With Nicholas Singleton and Kaytron Allen in the backfield as well Allar’s definitely in a good situation as a quarterback getting his first real collegiate action. And if he’s able to keep doing what he did against West Virginia then Penn State’s ceiling is higher than all but a few teams in the country. New coach new offense same Wisconsin Luke Fickell was probably the best coaching hire of the offseason and he made it clear that he planned to diversify Wisconsin’s offense from its traditional power approach. It remains to be seen how well that will work (Tanner Mordecai threw a pair of interceptions) but it didn’t need to Saturday. In Wisconsin’s 38-17 defeat of Buffalo the Badgers rushed for a total of 314 yards on an eye-popping 7.9 yards per carry. Chez Mellusi and Braelon Allen both looked spectacular rushing for 157 and 141 yards respectively. While Allen has been a 1000-yard rusher for consecutive seasons already Mellusi rushed for 473 yards in 10 games last season. If he’s able to get onto Allen’s level then Wisconsin could be an extremely dangerous challenge in the Big Ten this year. Big Ten West football is so back Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: Nebraska lost a one-score football game. Matt Rhule’s coaching debut looked like it was going to be an impressive physical win through 55 minutes. Then Anthony Grant fumbled and Minnesota’s Daniel Jackson made a spectacular catch in the corner of the end zone and Jeff Sims threw his third interception of the game (his second to All-American safety Tyler Nubin)...and then Minnesota’s Dragon Kesich drilled a 47-yard field goal at the gun. In Minnesota’s 13-10 victory the two teams combined for five turnovers and just 38 first downs. Nebraska looked like they could be a really good defensive team as did Minnesota but both teams had several offensive issues. In other words they’re perfect Big Ten West spoilers. But an even better depiction of Big Ten West football took place on Sunday afternoon on CBS. Despite being in the Big Ten East Rutgers put on a showcase of grind-it-out football in their 24-7 defeat of Northwestern. On the Scarlet Knights’ first two drives they ran a combined 32 plays for 155 yards over a mind-melting 15 minutes and eight seconds. The defense also stood strong holding Northwestern to just 12 rushing yards for the game. The key in the game was later downs: Rutgers went 8-for-18 on third down and 3-for-3 on fourth down while Northwestern was 4-for-14 and 1-for-3 (including a fake punt with a route run a yard short of the first down). Northwestern transfer Ben Bryant looked shaky with just 169 yards passing and two picks but he was also sacked five times. Wildcat fans are probably hoping that Bryant will return to his Cincinnati form especially if he’s able to stay upright and out of pressure. The legend of Pur-don’t returns ""Stop me if youve heard THIS one before: Purdue lost to a small school from the coast in a shocking upset. This time though it was on the football field instead of the basketball court. Despite being down double digits in the third quarter Fresno State came back to stun the Boilermakers in a 39-35 victory. The Bulldogs torched the Boilermakers defense tallying 487 yards 371 of which came through the air. Purdue did what they could and transfer quarterback Hudson Card looked very good throwing for 254 yards and a pair of scores. Despite everything that went right for the Boilermakers — the performance from Card a kickoff return for a touchdown and a missed field goal by Fresno State — Purdue was unable to come out on top. And it won’t get any easier for the Boilermakers: every team left on their schedule is in the Power Five.""

Share this story Less than 24 hours after his head coaching debut a 24-7 loss at Rutgers David Braun was back on Northwestern’s campus to speak to media members at his weekly press conference. Here’s everything that Braun had to say about the action in Piscataway and his team’s upcoming matchup against UTEP this Saturday: David Braun Opening statement: “Certainly disappointed with yesterday’s result. I’ve had an opportunity to go back and look at the film. There’s some positive things to build off of. We’re gonna build off of those things plenty to identify in terms of a lot of work to be done in all three phases of the game. We’ve got to start faster on defense. Two 16-play drives to open the game gives no one an opportunity to get into a rhythm whether that be us on defense creating momentum or giving our offense an opportunity to catch rhythm in the early stages of the game. Offensively [there’s an] opportunity for us to identify where we need to improve and get much better. But there were plays out there plenty of missed opportunities. There’s going to be an opportunity for our team to learn from yesterday this afternoon and then very quickly move on to UTEP. The preparation for UTEP has already started. Meetings today will probably be 30% review of Rutgers and 70% focus on capitalizing on an opportunity to prepare for UTEP on a short week.” On Northwestern entering the week as a 1.5-point underdog to UTEP: “I’ve never paid attention to lines never will. I think this group is at its best when it’s an underdog so that sits just fine with me.” On the staff’s communication leading up to and during Northwestern’s fake punt and its justification of the call: “We had talked about that for multiple weeks now and knew that Rutgers was a heavy pressure team was going to find ways to come after multiple punts throughout the day. And we were very calculated in terms of the specific scenario where we thought that might be a good opportunity for us to take. Felt really good about where we were at from an execution standpoint with that look and that fake and the guys that were executing on it. It was a point in the game where we needed to find a way to build some momentum and we were down 14-0 at the time. Felt really good about the communication that went on on the sideline leading up to the decision to call it in. The mechanics from that team were exactly what we wanted them to be.  “Going back and evaluating it would’ve loved to have seen Rod [Heard II] push it a couple more yards vertical on the route. The kid from Rutgers [Carnell Davis] to his credit made a great play. [Hunter] Renner’s execution Rod’s execution credit them. They didn’t blink Rod makes a nice catch. In a perfect world we would’ve had it dialed up on a fourth-and-6 but again we didn’t go out to New Jersey just to play to stay in the game. We went out to New Jersey to win a football game and felt like that call was a complete embodiment of that. We needed to find a way to flip the momentum and the reason for that call was very much to do with that.” On Matt Lawson who left Sunday’s game with a lower-body injury and the defensive line’s depth: “There’s no update right now and haven’t gotten that far. I do feel good about the D-line depth in that room right now. I think that’s something Coach [Christian] Smith in that room has done a great job of building that up over the course of fall camp.” On the offensive line’s performance at Rutgers: “There’s plenty to look at in terms of things that are positive to build off of but that group knows that we need to improve. We need to do a better job of protecting our quarterback we need to do a better job of establishing the run game. And that’s something that they recognize as well. There’s plenty to take from as positives and we’re going to take those positives we’re going to identify where we need to get better and we’re going to be right back at it this afternoon preparing for UTEP.” On how Brendan Sullivan’s late-game touchdown drive impacts the quarterback competition with Ben Bryant: “Ben will be our starter for UTEP. Proud of the way Sully came in. You take stock in everything everything’s being evaluated. But Ben knows he needs to play better. We know we need to find ways to give him and the rest of the offense more opportunities to create rhythm and that comes with getting off the field on third down and fourth down defensively. Everything’s being evaluated; proud of the way that Sully handled himself and proud of the way that our offense closed out the game.” On sending more secondary blitzes in the second half against Rutgers: “A lot of those pressures were very calculated in terms of attacking the run game and knowing that based on the situation we had to find ways to get them behind the sticks. But none of the things that you saw in the second half were strong deviations from the gameplan. There were certainly adjustments that were happening throughout the game not just at halftime. It was a chess match throughout the game whether that be in-series timeouts in between series but all things that are within the framework of our defensive structure and the concepts that we teach. But we certainly knew that we needed to pick our moments to be aggressive and find ways to get them behind the chains because we needed to get the stinking ball back to our offense.” On Devin Turner’s impact as a sophomore: “It’s really exciting. I think the thing that’s really exciting is that he’s showing up he’s flashing and he’ll be the first one to tell you he’s still got so much room for improvement. He’s got an opportunity earlier in the game to finish on  a ball and he wants that opportunity back he wants that INT. There’s some things that he needs to continue to improve on in terms of his consistency. If he was sitting with us right now I’d be telling him the same thing. He knows that he understands that. Coach [Matt] MacPherson does a great job of pushing him and we will continue to do that. But don’t let my honesty hide the fact that we’re certainly very excited about his growth here over the course of spring fall camp into the beginning of the season and know that Devin will be a critical piece of our defense moving forward.” On the logistics of in-game decision-making with the coaching staff: “It’s a lot of conversation. Good conversation on gameday stems from preparation prior to gameday. There were conversations that were had leading into gameday about what the mechanics of that would look like. Certainly communication with Coach [Mike] Bajakian communication with Coach [Skip] Holtz at times in between series and then finding a really good balance of trusting the wisdom that exists on this staff while also making decisions based on my sense of where the game’s at that I feel are in the team’s best interest.” On the roles of defensive assistant coach D.J. Vokolek and Special Assistant to the Head Coach Skip Holtz: “Coach Vokolek incredibly involved in everything that’s going on with the defense. He’s someone along with the rest of the defensive staff that I’m leaning on for perspective and feedback on things that are going with the game. D.J.’s certainly taking on a role in terms of gameplanning from a standpoint of the organization of everything while I’m wearing two hats right now. We’ve got great minds in that defensive room that are taking on heavier loads than they typically would be just because of the time and the way that it’s split. And D.J.’s doing a great job of helping me organize all that.  “When it comes to Coach Holtz it’s an extra eye for the offense it’s an extra eye for the defense in terms of him being able to see what’s going on and give information back to coaches most importantly myself. And then Coach Holtz being over a 20-year vet as a head coach it’s even conversations on the plane ride back as we get off the plane. He’s won big games he’s lost big games. He’s dealt with a lot of different things sitting in that head coach’s chair. It’s someone that can provide me with a lot of perspective. I think those that know me well understand that I’m incredibly self-critical and after a loss like yesterday I’m going to have a tendency to shoulder as much burden as I possibly can. And a guy like Coach Holtz [would say]: ‘Hey Dave we’re gonna be alright. There’s plenty of positives to take from this too.’ Both D.J. and Coach Holtz have been just great resources to already a staff that I certainly appreciate in terms of the way they’ve continued to coach and prepare.” On his mentality in the midst of a 12-game losing streak: “At the end of the day there’s no excuses there’s no explanations. What solutions are we finding to play winning football? And the easy thing to fall back going into yesterday was ‘Hey this is a new team.’ Talk about fall camp we had an opportunity to find out where we’re at both good and bad evaluate it move forward and [ask] how do we find a way to play winning football against UTEP. The thing that I can control day in and day out is the energy and enthusiasm I bring into the building meet these guys where they’re at and speak truth into them. What I mean by speaking truth into them is we have plenty of talent. We have a team that can win a bunch of football games this year. Speaking truth to them is making sure they understand that that they know that I believe in them they got a bunch of other people that believe in them. Momentum’s a powerful thing. It’s time to get the momentum going in the right direction and let that thing roll downhill. That starts with — like I told the team in the locker room last night — we’ll have a quick evaluation of the Rutgers film here this afternoon but a majority of what we’re doing today is focus on UTEP.” On how to get Cam Porter more involved in the run game: “We’re going to get off the field on third and fourth down on defense and find ways to get the ball back to our offense so that we have more opportunities and we’re going to find a way to get up so that we can get our running backs more touches. It’s a lot easier to feel comfortable running the football on a consistent basis when you’re not down two scores in the first half.” On potentially giving Sullivan more snaps if the team continues to struggle: “Ben Bryant is our starter for UTEP and we plan on Ben being our starter moving forward. We evaluate everything at all positions but we don’t want anyone playing with this mentality that they’re looking over their shoulder. We want Ben to rip it with a bunch of confidence and go help this team win games. We’re going to continue to push Sully and Ryan Hilinski and everyone in this program at all positions to say ‘keep pushing.’ Own your role but keep pushing. We talk about owning our roles well Brendan Sullivan has owned his role throughout camp and moving forward into prep for Rutgers. That doesn’t mean that Sully has to be satisfied with his role. Shoot there’s plenty of guys on this roster. Robert Fitzgerald has owned his role as a backup for our defense and a special teams guy. That doesn’t mean that he has to be satisfied with it. We want him to continue to push to find ways to get on the field more often. So Ben’s going to be our starter going into UTEP I know our team will be backing him and I know our quarterback room’s going to continue to push to own their role but not be satisfied with the role that they currently have.” On integrating more high-ranked recruits like Anto Saka as the season goes along: “The plan is to give guys opportunities that earn those opportunities. And Anto’s done that. He flashes a ton and he’s continued to feel really comfortable in all situations within our defense and play with a great deal of consistency. But to his credit Anto has earned those opportunities. I’m really excited for that young man and the same applies to everyone within their program. As they earn those opportunities they’re going to find ways on the field.” \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story As Northwestern football entered its spring practices in March one position on the roster that appeared to exude some promise and stability was at quarterback. While the collective metrics of the Wildcats’ men under center were very subpar last year optimism was generated in the form of incoming junior Brendan Sullivan. In the five games he played in 2022 Sullivan displayed athleticism improvisation mobility and arm talent — particularly closing his year strong in Minneapolis notching an 86.7 PFF passing grade against the Golden Gophers. However a hit in the second quarter of that November matchup broke Sullivan’s sternum which knocked him out for the remaining contests of 2022. From the outside looking in Sullivan seemed to be the frontrunner to start for the ‘Cats this summer. Yet that changed drastically when sixth-year Ben Bryant transferred to Evanston from Cincinnati. Some in his position could have been exasperated by the addition of a different possible starting quarterback but Sullivan appreciated the chance to hone his game against a more sage player. “Obviously you want to be the starter but competition invites you to be better” Sullivan said after Tuesday’s practice. “That’s what Ben did. I’m happy he’s here.” Resentment could have extended to a newcomer in the fray too. But that wasn’t the case whatsoever with the elder Bryant and the younger Sullivan who have formed a close relationship. “You wouldn’t think that a guy coming in to in a sense take your job you guys would be really good friends” Sullivan said. “But that dude is a great human being. I’m super happy that he’s in our room and I’ve learned so much from him. “Shout out to him for being who he is and looking out for us. We’re going to look out for him the same way.” Throughout this offseason and in camp Sullivan mentioned focusing on improving his eyes and footwork adding that he felt he played at a “really high level” in the spring and into August. Despite a tight battle for the QB1 job that lasted until the first week of September Bryant emerged as the starter. Rather than become despondent or bitter after realizing he would begin a second straight season as NU’s backup quarterback Sullivan emphasized his ability to assist Bryant and the rest of the team even if not on the field.  “I’m going to execute my job no matter what it is: if it’s the backup [if] it’s fifth string if I’m hurt” the junior said. “I’m going to do my job to the best of my abilities; that’s what I’m going to try and do day in and day out. I’m going to lift Ben up the best I can do to make sure he’s prepared — and make sure this team is prepared — because at the end of the day we all want to win.” In the Wildcats’ season opener at Rutgers Bryant got the nod posting a measly 14.8 QBR and throwing two interceptions as NU scored zero points with its first-team offense. With 2:45 left in the game interim head coach David Braun elected to insert Sullivan and several other backups. The junior gunslinger led a 10-play 45-yard drive that culminated in a goal-line touchdown pass to first-year RB Caleb Komolafe. On the possession Sullivan went 3-for-4 with 13 passing yards and 11 rushing yards — ironically enough making him Northwestern’s game-leading rusher. “It felt really good” Sullivan said about the series. “Your job as the backup is to execute when your number’s called on.” In the wake of Bryant’s struggles and the Wildcats’ dismal offensive output questions emerged about whether Sullivan could garner more starting reps in the near future. Braun largely nixed those by noting that Bryant was the starter for this week’s game against UTEP and “moving forward” but still praised Sullivan. “Proud of the way Sully came in” Braun said Monday. “You take stock in everything; everything’s being evaluated... We talk about owning our roles well Brendan Sullivan has owned his role throughout camp and moving forward into prep for Rutgers. That doesn’t mean that Sully has to be satisfied with his role.” Whether or not Sullivan is utilized more frequently in the next few weeks largely hinges on the play of Bryant plus NU’s collective offensive output with the transfer at the helm. Regardless the junior is actively rooting for Bryant’s success even if it reduces his own opportunities. “I’m always prepared to be the starter but I’m not wishing that that’s going to happen” Sullivan said. “I know Ben’s a great quarterback; he’s going to execute at a very high level. I would never wish for him to lose his job or for something to happen to him. I know that he’s going to do a really good job the rest of the season and I’ll always be prepared to back him up.” A year ago Sullivan entered August in a similar position before notching starting reps against Wisconsin in Week Six a position he didn’t relinquish until his injury. If Bryant remains Northwestern’s starter for all of 2023 — with Sullivan idle on the bench — some could view the year as prohibiting the junior’s long-standing development. Yet Sullivan isn’t prioritizing his own growth or snaps over large-scale program-wide objectives. “My goals are to help this team out as best as possible. My goals are to win as a team” Sullivan remarked. “I want to win a Big Ten Championship. Whatever my role is in that — this year it’s being a backup. This year it’s helping my team out as best as possible off the field and then a little bit on the field. So that’s what I’m going to do.”  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story In his first two seasons Russell Payne spent August and much of September cycling through a variety of strategies and setups but this year has been anything but that. Northwestern has a clear identity and while there are still questions over its efficacy especially in conference play it’s hard to argue with three wins and a draw in four contests. This is not to suggest consistency in ideas has led to better results. In fact much of what comprises “tactics” in any match is opponent-dependent meaning (appropriate) change from one game to the next is a vital component of winning. The stability in approach and positive outcomes just happen to be the two primary themes of the ‘Cats’ opening four games. One additional benefit of NU’s unchanging strategy is I’ve already laid out the general components of it in my piece from last week so I can focus on match-specific adaptations and more minute details. Provided Payne doesn’t completely switch things up this should lead to more brevity in articles going forward without sacrificing clarity. Anyway here’s what the Wildcats got up to in their first two away matches of the campaign: Friday Sept. 1 (Milwaukee Wis.) Even if I didn’t add the caveat about trying to keep the word count on these updates in check I would not be writing much about this affair. Milwaukee first of all was extremely rudimentary in possession (IP). The Panthers’ primary attacking strategy was to hit long balls up to their striker and take advantage of the chaos that formed when he was able to knock the ball down to a teammate. Otherwise they hardly got close to scoring from open play relying on set pieces as the alternative method of chance creation — their lone goal came from a corner.  Now to be fair to the Horizon League side simple doesn’t equate to bad especially when said center forward was winning all of his duels but there’s just not much more to say on the matter. Only when a Collin McCamy free kick gave the ‘Cats the lead midway through the second period did Milwaukee start prioritizing possession of the ball more. Northwestern held firm in its 4-4-1-1/4-4-2 midblock and the few chances that did fall to the home side weren’t converted.  NU’s IP was nearly just as uninspiring with much of what I previously discussed (unsurprisingly) still applicable. Getting quality opportunities to score from settled play is this team’s biggest weakness. Having said that when they had the ball the Wildcats did display some interesting movements and patterns to play through the Panthers’ defensive structure. The wide positioning of the Northwestern CBs isn’t a mistake nor is Jackson Weyman being that far out of his own net. Against Milwaukee’s very passive 4-1-4-1 this alignment created a 3v1 against the CF (No. 9) and offered simple circulation routes around any attempted pressing from him. Additionally the Panthers went man-to-man in the midfield but only to a certain limit. If Rom Brown shuttled to the touchline the LCM (No. 22) would pass him on to the LW (No. 20) but this is where the problems began. In response to Brown’s movement the RB (Ibrahim Obeid at the start of the match) would push higher. Initially Milwaukee had a response to this with No. 22 moving deeper to block access to Brandon Clagette while No. 20 would press Brown in-to-out. This would force the senior midfielder back to Nigel Prince at RCB and the Wildcats would presumably have to restart their attack. However this restart gave NU an opportunity. After Brown passes to Prince the Atlanta native goes “back” (more like sideways) to his goalkeeper evading the half-hearted press from No. 9 and more importantly initiating a reset in Milwaukee’s block. While the Panthers’ left side reorganized Brown stayed exactly where he was. Two passes later he’s receiving with far more space as No. 20’s recovery distance has increased and can now look forward to the overload down the line. The clip below is a prime example and while nothing comes of it in this particular instance the intent is what’s important. pic.twitter.com/RFCsuPGqeq Later on — primarily in the second half when NU had the ball on one side — the Panthers would have the winger on the opposite side narrow onto the ball-far DM. Then the Milwaukee ball-far CM would move across to mark  Here Reese Mayer is in possession down Northwestern’s left so the LW (now No. 10) moves infield to mark Brown (RDM) and No. 22 goes to McCamy (now LDM). As previously covered Weyman’s connectivity between the two CBs enables easy circulation around No. 9 and the ‘Cats can access the far-side without much trouble. In this situation when Reese Mayer gets the ball to Prince via the GK a farther pass to Bryant Mayer at RB will create some problems for the Panthers. That specific pass necessitates a jump by No. 10 from Brown to Bryant Mayer or else the freshman can just carry forward. In turn that defensive action frees Brown unless No. 19 (DM) jumps to him from his shielding position; but then that opens space centrally which Jason Gajadhar can arrive in. This exact situation led to Clagette getting a good look at goal following a one-two with Justin Weiss and in my opinion was the best sequence Northwestern conjured all game.  pic.twitter.com/ffy24rmWrn Monday Sept. 4 (Chicago Ill.) You know what didn’t stay consistent? The uniforms. After playing all three of its previous games in the new all-gray strips Northwestern went back to the standard all-purples and failed to win for the first time this season. If there wasn’t much to say on the ‘Cats’ clash with Milwaukee there really isn’t much to say on their first clash of the year with another Chicago-based school. The game gave off the effect of a training session with the same exact sequences being drilled over and over again but yielding little success. Both sides struggled to play through the press presented to them by their opponents — NU’s standard 4-2-3-1 press against DePaul’s 4-1-2-3 buildup DePaul’s 4-4-2 press against NU’s usual 4-2-1-3 buildup. As a result long balls from defenders became quite a common occurrence and winning second balls in the midfield was the only reliable progression method for either team. Naturally set pieces played a massive part in determining the outcome of this match. Following a bombardment of the Wildcat box early in the second period a corner fell to a Blue Demon at the edge of the box and he volleyed it into the top corner to break the deadlock. The home side had opportunities to put the game away while the ‘Cats chased an equalizer but couldn’t beat Weyman for a second time. By nodding home a McCamy corner in the 84th minute Bryant Mayer made the Blue Demons pay for their lack of clinical edge and preserved Northwestern’s unbeaten record. To be honest after DePaul scored NU looked especially poor and it really didn’t do enough to warrant getting a draw out of this fixture. In an effort to improve Northwestern’s play in deeper phases Payne switched from the 4-2-1-3 to a 3-1-2-4 by pushing the RB high in the wide right channel and narrowing the RW. The impact was minimal with the only real benefit being the 3v2 it created against DePaul’s front two. This led to the ‘Cats having a bit more (unthreatening) possession but the transition defense was severely weakened and they had even greater struggles entering the final third. In fact the corner that resulted in the goal came from a rare foray into that part of the pitch. While this might sound pretty doom and gloom especially for a team that’s 3-1-0 it wasn’t all bad. Ugo Achara Jr. made his much-anticipated second debut for the Wildcats entering the game in the 28th minute. Within 10 minutes he had already picked up a yellow for attempting a bicycle kick but making contact with a nearby defender’s cheek instead of the ball. Additionally first-year Fritz Volmar deserves a mention. He’s come in and made the left back position his own and it’s not hard to see why. The Peoria native is physically gifted — he’s quick and has a massive tackling/dueling radius due to his long legs. His technical level is equally as good and the defensive fundamentals are there as well.

Share this story It’s been 690 days since Northwestern’s last win on U.S. soil. Yet somehow that doesn’t feel like the story. Rather for a team with no expectations heading into its opener in Piscataway Northwestern still managed to disappoint. With the ghost of the program’s most tumultuous offseason lingering fans hoped to see something of promise for a team looking to change the narrative. News flash: they weren’t given any of that. In simplest terms Northwestern fell flat sputtering its way to a 17-point loss leaving fans questioning what a path back up the ladder even looks like. A game deemed winnable on the schedule Northwestern plagued by mishaps and poor execution couldn’t shake off a performance reminiscent of last year’s shortcomings. The problems started defensively where Northwestern failed to apply any pressure on Rutgers QB Gavin Wimsatt turning a weak spot for the Scarlet Knights into one of their strengths. Offensively an emphasis on throwing the ball whenever possible led to choppy drives that stalled at midfield. Northwestern’s final rushing total — 22 attempts for 12 yards — in comparison to throwing the football 40 times paints a picture of the team as a whole: unbalanced and ineffective. That needs to change and it starts with better play up front giving Ben Bryant and Cam Porter the time to make the right reads at the line of scrimmage. Even with Brendan Sullivan orchestrating a touchdown drive in the waning moments of Sunday’s defeat interim head coach David Braun was quick to reiterate the team moving forward with Bryant under center. Bryant’s 169 passing yards and two interceptions on 57% accuracy provided a murky picture of what to expect moving forward. Early Bryant looked good lobbing a beautiful touch pass to A.J. Henning for a 26-yard completion. His arm strength and mobility impressed too with a couple scampers helping the ‘Cats move the chains. Outside of that Rutgers’ ability to overpower Northwestern’s offensive line frazzled the transfer leading to poor accuracy on key throws and eventually two interceptions. A disappointing debut it’ll be interesting to see what kind of leash he’s got with the capable Sullivan waiting in the wings. Sticking with the offense Henning’s first game showed glimpses of what Northwestern can be excited about moving forward. The Michigan transfer finished with four catches for 42 yards and two carries for one yard. For a team that doesn’t have many dynamic playmakers the ‘Cats need to get the ball into his hands moving forward. However until the Wildcats find some production in the trenches being outplayed will be the norm. And it translates to the defensive side too. A lack of pressure on the quarterback and an inability to get off the field let Rutgers string together long time-consuming drives tiring out a defense that couldn’t catch a break. If Rutgers exposed those weaknesses imagine what it looks like against Duke or Penn State in the coming weeks. Figuring out ways to harass the pocket should be Braun’s number one priority because without it Northwestern’s tumble is bound to continue. There were a couple of defensive bright spots: linebacker Bryce Gallagher was a force tallying a career-high 19 tackles while Devin Turner caused chaos by finding ways to make an impact on the back-end with five tackles. Those are two pieces to continue to build confidence around as the ‘Cats search for positives. Looking to end its 12-game skid Northwestern travels back home as 1.5-point underdogs against UTEP. While possibly jarring the underdog mentality is something Northwestern needs to embody. With the smell of a 1-11 campaign a culture of hazing a mess of an offseason and a new interim head coach still swirling next to the Northwestern name the ‘Cats are as “underdog” as it gets. Their backs have been up against the wall all offseason and Rutgers pushed them deeper into the corner. UTEP is a must-win game not in terms of bowl aspirations or winning the Big Ten West (because that isn’t happening) but for the program as a whole. The schedule only gets harder with a trip to Duke and the Big Ten gauntlet on the horizon and a winless Northwestern heading into early October with a game against Howard feels like a moment where rock bottom gets a whole lot deeper.  It’s hard to measure success for a team that’s gone through everything the ‘Cats have faced. But the performance at Rutgers certainly wasn’t it and although a win doesn’t solve anything it’s a building block to rebuild Northwestern football. So no pressure David Braun — but if there’s a time to instill some confidence in a team that hasn’t won in over a year now’s the time. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After dropping its opener for the first time since 2018 the Northwestern field hockey team needed to regroup. Despite outshooting No. 9 (currently No. 5) Louisville by a staggering margin of 21-3 the Wildcats were unable to put a goal across and lost the match 1-0. With the Big Ten/ACC Challenge coming up less than a week later the ‘Cats had to adjust quickly. Based off the title of this article you’ve probably already figured out that the ‘Cats did indeed regain momentum. They opened the Big Ten/ACC Challenge with No. 16 (No. 17 at the time) Boston College a team that Northwestern was 13-4 against all-time. However all four of those losses were at neutral sites and this game was played not in Boston or Evanston but in College Park Maryland. It was a real possibility that Northwestern could do what it did in 2021 and lose to BC at a neutral site during the inter-conference battle. Luckily for the Wildcats their neutral site woes did not carry over to 2023. The game started very similarly to the Louisville contest: Northwestern controlled the ball and the pace and did not allow a shot in the first quarter. Unluckily for the Wildcats their shooting struggles from that Louisville game did carry over. The pair of shots Northwestern mustered in the opening frame failed to even threaten the goal with Olivia Bent-Cole’s getting blocked and Lauren Hunter’s going wide. In the second quarter Boston College bounced back putting up a pair of shots within 15 seconds of each other less than two minutes in. However both of those shots were swallowed up by 2022 All-West Second Team goalkeeper Annabel Skubisz. Skubisz also saved a shot off a penalty corner by Lafayette transfer Simone Hefting later in the period but her counterpart Golden Eagles goalkeeper Caroline Kelly was no slouch. Kelly twice a Second Team All-Conference player while at Boston University saved all three shots directed at her in the quarter to match Skubisz. Once again Northwestern went to halftime locked in a scoreless tie. That tie would remain for the remainder of regulation. Despite a ferocious attack midway through the third period that saw Alia Marshall take four penalty corners in a mere 30 seconds Northwestern was unable to get its first goal of the season. The fourth quarter was no better for either squad with Skubisz saving two more shots and the Wildcats failing to even get a shot on goal. In the game’s extra period though things would flip. Despite finishing second on the team with 13 goals in 2022 graduate midfielder Peyton Halsey hadn’t taken a shot all game. That changed just under six minutes into the overtime period. Halsey received a beautiful pass from center back Ilse Tromp (who was playing in her second collegiate game) and slotted a shot past Kelly to open the scoring. It was Northwestern’s first goal of the season and it gave the team its first win of the year beating the Eagles 1-0. Following that momentum boost the ‘Cats faced another ranked foe in No. 13 Duke. The Blue Devils traditionally had found success against the Wildcats with Northwestern holding a 5-8 all-time record when the had two schools met. It seemed as though another loss would be added to that record after 10 minutes of play. Despite allowing just one goal in her first 127 minutes of play to begin the year Skubisz gave up two in only 10 minutes to Duke. Luckily for Skubisz the offense had gotten a taste of scoring in the previous contest. It was hungry for more. Bent-Cole the first-year who had already taken five shots to begin the year earned the first goal of her collegiate career on the sixth. The shot was a much-needed adrenaline booster for the team and it clearly carried over into the next three quarters. Bent-Cole’s goal was scored after Duke misplayed a ball in the shooting circle. That theme held for the next goal as well after sophomore Maja Zivojnovic ripped a powerful shot off the right goalpost. Duke couldn’t pounce on the ricochet but the graduate student Marshall could. She easily tapped the ball into the back of the net to tie the game at 2-2 just over eight minutes into the second quarter.  The go-ahead goal came in the third quarter and was of course on a loose ball in the shooting circle. After a powerful shot by Lane Herbert went wide Duke once again failed to cover the ball. That left an opportunity for Chloe Relford who slotted the ball past Duke’s prone goalkeeper to give the Wildcats the lead. After 22 minutes of Duke ferociously trying (and failing) to tie the game again Northwestern escaped with a 3-2 win and an unblemished record at the ACC/Big Ten Challenge for the second straight year. The third game of the road trip saw the Wildcats travel to Burlington Vermont to take on the Catamounts. Much like the Duke game the contest against Vermont saw a fast offensive start. This time however the offense was on Northwestern’s side as the Wildcats scored both their goals in the first half. The first came from Halsey — the first player to notch multiple goals on the year — and the second came from Zivojnovic in the second quarter. The goal was the first of her career a wonderful start to 2023 after she suffered a season-ending injury last September. The defense also returned to its lockdown ways led by Skubisz. The senior earned Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week honors for her efforts (the third such award of her career) which resulted in 13 saves and just two goals allowed over the course of the three games. While the award failed to account for her shutout of Vermont (it was voted on the day before) that game remains important. It was the 12th shutout of Skubisz’s career moving her into sole possession of sixth the all-time Northwestern leaderboard. The Wildcat offense has also gotten back on track. After failing to convert any of their 21 shots against Louisville the ‘Cats’ scorers have begun attacking with a vengeance. They’ve converted six of their 42 shots over the last three games and that mark of two goals per game is on track to be top-40 in the nation rather than the current slot of 56th. If the team can continue being aggressive and young players like Bent-Cole and Tromp can continue taking advantage of their opportunities the high rate of scoring should last for the rest of the season. That production is extremely likely to last at least past the weekend. The team is back on the road to take on Maine on Friday. NU will then stay in the Pine Tree State to take on UMass on Saturday. It will be the last weekend without Big Ten play and Tracey Fuchs will look to iron out any remaining issues before conference play begins later this month. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story From Thursday to Sunday all 14 teams in the Big Ten opened up their seasons some in close games and some in blowouts. Every team has played and there is one thing for sure: before the conference expands next year there will be one more year of exciting football. Does this mean parity? Maybe and time will tell. Now that every team is 1-0 or 0-1 let’s dive into the newest Big Ten Football power rankings. 1. Michigan Last Ranking: 1 Last Result: 30-3 win vs East Carolina Next: vs UNLV Don’t expect Michigan to fall from the No. 1 spot for a while — its next three games are UNLV Bowling Green and Rutgers all at home and the three should be cakewalks. The Wolverines are one of the most talented teams in the country led by one of the best backfields in the country in Blake Corum and Donovan Edwards. If both are healthy Michigan is a championship contender and that’s obvious. What stood out most from Michigan this weekend was its constant support for coach Jim Harbaugh who is serving a three-game suspension for NCAA recruiting violations during the COVID-19 period. Though the suspension was self-imposed by the school players still are advocating for Harbaugh’s return. The coach will not be on the sidelines for two more games and though it won’t make much of a difference players care. 2. Penn State Last Ranking: 2 Last Result: 38-15 win vs West Virginia Next: vs Delaware James Franklin’s Nittany Lions rolled over West Virginia like they should have but what stood out most was the defense. Penn State held a West Virginia offense that averaged 30.2 points per game last season to 15 and though the Mountaineers did experience turnover that’s a statement to the defense. Manny Diaz was one of the best coordinators in college football last year and the Penn State defense looks to be one of the top in the country again. On the other side of the ball Drew Allar performed well in his first start and should continue to get positive snaps in. With him Nick Singleton and Kaytron Allen and a talented wide receiver group it’s hard to find a weakness. Can this be the year Penn State knocks off Michigan or Ohio State? It might be. 3. Ohio State Last Ranking: 3 Last Result: 23-3 win at Indiana Next: vs Youngstown State Yes Ohio State won and yes Ohio State won pretty easily but the biggest roster concern here is the quarterback. This is the first time in his Buckeye coaching career that Ryan Day does not have one of the top quarterbacks in the country as Justin Fields and C.J. Stroud both got Heisman recognition. Now he has Kyle McCord and Devin Brown who do not flash the same abilities.  Does this mean McCord who is the starter for now can’t be elite? No. He has all the tools to be including two of the best wide receivers in the nation in Marvin Harrison Jr. and Emeka Egbuka. If McCord or Brown figures it out and the Buckeyes have an elite quarterback once again they’ll leap up these rankings. 4. Wisconsin Last Ranking: 4 Last Result: 38-17 win vs Buffalo Next: at Washington State Even with all the buzz around new transfer quarterback Tanner Mordecai Wisconsin rolled Buffalo in typical Wisconsin fashion: both Braelon Allen and Chez Mellusi rushed for over 140 yards — 141 and 157 respectively — to take down the Buffaloes. Mordecai did not have a great game but it didn’t matter. Luke Fickell and Phil Longo should figure it out in this system. Last year Wisconsin rolled in its season opener then folded at Camp Randall Stadium against Washington State. Now they play the Cougars in Pullman with a chance for revenge.  5. Iowa Last Ranking: 5 Last Result: 24-14 win against Utah State Next: at Iowa State What stands out most for Iowa this year has to be quarterback Cade McNamara. With the experience he has including leading Michigan to the College Football Playoff in his first year as a starter the Iowa offense should be more high scoring. For Brian Ferentz’s sake though can it score over 25 points per game? It depends on McNamara’s health and production. Iowa’s defense is the same as it always is: toward the top of the Big Ten and scary for most teams. It will be a test against Iowa State this weekend but the Hawkeyes are up for it. 6. Maryland Last Ranking: 6 Last Result: 38-6 win vs Towson Next: vs Charlotte It’s hard to judge the Terrapins at this point in time and is going to be hard to judge them with their upcoming schedule; Maryland should run through Charlotte and Virginia due to the talent gap on the offensive side of the ball. Sept. 23 against Michigan State though is where it gets interesting. For Maryland to find real success this year it all comes down to Taulia Tagovailoa. He lost a major weapon in Dontay Demus but still has some in Corey Dyches DeShaun Jones and others. Roman Hemby is a good running back and the Terps have an offense if Tagovailoa stays healthy. 7. Minnesota Last Ranking: 7 Last Result: 13-10 win vs Nebraska Next: vs Eastern Michigan Minnesota deserved to be moved down after its performance on Thursday night against Nebraska. Two things contributed to them not falling: their elite defense and other Big Ten teams below them.  The Gopher defense which was the sixth-best scoring defense in college football last year was able to hold Matt Rhule’s new Nebraska offense to only 10 points. Jeff Sims was barely a threat in the air and he will always be on the ground but the Minnesota defense can be stingy again. The main question with Minnesota is Athan Kaliakmanis and whether he can be a good or even serviceable quarterback. While they did get the win on Thursday night there were times where Kaliakmanis could not make the throws necessary to win big games. Yes the defense bailed the Gopher offense out against Nebraska but that won’t happen against better offenses. They see Drake Maye and UNC in two weeks — do you think that offense is scoring only 10 points? 8. Illinois Last Ranking: 8 Last Result: 30-28 win vs Toledo Next: at Kansas Illinois barely escaped against Toledo and for a defense that ranked second in the Big Ten last year it lacked personality on Saturday night. While the Illini did lose key pieces such as Devon Witherspoon Sydney Brown and others Brett Bielema has some work to do on this end of the ball. Luke Altmyer played fine at quarterback but in a conference with high-scoring offenses (Penn State comes to Champaign next week) he needs to be better. The Fighting Illini have an interesting challenge this week going to play Kansas on the road. Jalon Daniels who became one of the more intriguing quarterbacks in the nation last year is set to return after missing Week One. Daniels is the Big 12 Preseason Offensive Player of the Year and passed for 544 yards last time he played in a game. Illinois has a test. 9. Michigan State Last Ranking: 11 Last Result: 31-7 win vs Central Michigan Next: vs Richmond Finally some movement! Mel Tucker and Michigan State move into the top 10 after battering Central Michigan in East Lansing on Friday night. What stood out most for the Spartans was the defense which held Central Michigan to under 100 yards passing.  Richmond should be easy but the real test is next week when No. 8 Washington and Heisman hopeful Michael Penix comes to town. Penix who just lit up Boise State is supposed to lead one of the best air attacks in the nation and the Spartan defense might be able to slow him down. 10. Rutgers Last Ranking: 13 Last Result: 24-7 win vs Northwestern Next: vs Temple Just like Michigan State Rutgers moves into the top ten after a resounding win against Northwestern. While Northwestern is not a top team Rutgers dominated for 60 minutes. The key for the Scarlet Knights this season is and always will be Gavin Wimsatt: he is the highest Rutgers football recruit ever and finally has the chance to start an entire season. Wimsatt needs to find the consistency necessary and cut down on turnovers for RU to be competitive once again. The defense in particular the pass rush could be scary with Aaron Lewis. Without Wimsatt producing though none of it matters. 11. Purdue Last Ranking: 9 Last Result: 39-35 loss vs Fresno State Next: at Virginia Tech Purdue fresh off a Big Ten Championship appearance last season had its defense lay an egg against Fresno State in the season opener. Similar to last year the high-flying offense was not supported by the defense at all in a loss. This killed them with Aidan O’Connell at the helm and it will with Hudson Card too. It doesn’t get easier for the Boilermakers either who now have to go to Lane Stadium to play Virginia Tech. There would have been less pressure if they were 1-0 and not 0-1. 12. Nebraska Last Ranking: 10 Last Result: 13-10 loss at Minnesota Next: at Colorado Even with a new head coach Nebraska lost in typical Nebraska fashion. Being defeated by a last-second field goal has to be a similar dagger for the Huskers and their fans. While the defense performed valiantly the offense let them down. Jeff Sims needs to be better next week. The Colorado defense they’ll oppose this week might be worse too as Minnesota has one of the top defenses in the nation. The problem? The offense they are going to face is much better. Nebraska has to go head-to-head with Coach Prime Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter in their first home game in Boulder. That place is going to be electric and the Buffaloes can light it up. 13. Indiana Last Ranking: 12 Last Result: 23-3 loss vs Ohio State Next: vs Indiana State Indiana lost by 20 on Saturday against Ohio State and the game was closer than a lot thought it should be. But the Hoosiers still move down on account that they could not score. It should change this week against Indiana State. And last... 14. Northwestern Last Ranking: 14 Last Result: 24-7 loss at Rutgers Next: vs UTEP In a game where the Wildcats should have kept it close they were beaten by a Rutgers team that does not have THAT much more talent. The killer was the two 16-play drives by the Scarlet Knights where Northwestern could not make a play. Soon enough they were down 14-0 and it only got worse. The question is: can the Wildcats be competitive? If Ben Bryant is solid yes. A.J. Henning and Cam Johnson both look like viable weapons. The secondary appeared good after the first drive. The biggest issue is the trenches: Northwestern did not pressure Wimsatt enough and the offensive line was in shambles for a lot of the game. Can the ‘Cats turn it around like many in that locker room believe they can?

Share this story After a blowout loss at Rutgers Northwestern might have one of its best chances of the entire season to notch a win coming this Saturday. The UTEP Miners are heading to Ryan Field and with the two teams never having played before there’s a lot to learn about the 1.5-point road favorites.  600 ESPN El Paso’s Adrian Broaddus was kind enough to answer a few questions about UTEP and how its first two weeks have gone as well as how head coach Dana Dimel’s team can come away with a win at Northwestern. Go give him a Twitter follow @AdrianBroaddus to learn some more about the Miners heading into Saturday afternoon! INU: After rebuilding from the brutal 2017-19 stretch what’s the general mood around the program right now? Has approaching bowl contention in ‘21 and ‘22 left fans satisfied with what head coach Dana Dimel’s done or are there higher expectations this year? Adrian Broaddus: The program has flipped from being in the abyss of mediocrity/poor football play to now having legit expectations around the program. There are obvious pros and cons to this. On the positive side it has prompted this staff to recruit better players to UTEP and it has allowed the program to embrace loftier expectations. Conversely the more fans expect a winner the more frustrated fans will continue to get.  While bowl contention was exciting in 2021 for some fans other fans would point out Coach Dimel’s overall record since he’s been at UTEP (18-41). Ultimately fans aren’t going to be satisfied until UTEP is either competing for C-USA titles or out of C-USA altogether... conference realignment is another can of worms.  INU: The C-USA has clearly undergone some massive changes. How do you think that affects UTEP’s long-term outlook? AB: There’s no secret about it: UTEP was left out of conference realignment and they are looking for any way to land into the Mountain West. With a rich history in the Border Conference and the WAC UTEP fans have been barking about the Miners getting out of C-USA for years now. Their rivals — New Mexico State — recently joined the conference which could allow for more meaningful games between the two schools. UTEP is focused on trying to be better in C-USA in athletics for now and if there’s an opening in the future for the Mountain West the Miners will be the first in line.  INU: UTEP comes into this game as a 1.5-point road favorite. What are some of the strengths that the Miners have on both sides of the ball that make them well-positioned to not just win but control the game? AB: Offensively they pride themselves on controlling the clock and establishing the run. UTEP feels like their offensive line is their strength on offense. Truthfully they won’t have any sort of success unless they put up points. The Miners put up just 14 points at Jacksonville State two weeks ago and the biggest issue for them in that contest was missing out on opportunities when they put together long drives.  On defense they need to find ways to get off on third downs. Their defensive line held strong in their first two games. However they need to ensure their secondary is intact and ready for a balanced offensive attack. If their defensive line can push past a beefy Northwestern front they could have success disrupting the quarterback and try to create turnovers.  INU: On the other hand what are some of UTEP’s biggest defensive weaknesses that Northwestern’s offense could exploit? AB: Up-tempo offenses typically hurt UTEP but they were able to slow down FCS Incarnate Word in the second half of their 28-14 win last Saturday. In the second half of the win Incarnate Word failed to put up more than 100 yards of offense (70) and were held scoreless in the third and fourth quarters thanks to the Miner defense. They’ve also struggled in creating turnovers consistently. If Northwestern can play turnover-free ball they’ll have a chance to get points on the board against UTEP.  INU: Northwestern’s non-conference approach has traditionally revolved around running the ball to death and controlling the clock. Given that UTEP isn’t much worse than the Wildcats (if at all) do you think that’s going to be the case on Saturday? If not how do you think the UTEP defense will force Northwestern to make adjustments early? AB: I think it could be a fight in the trenches and a battle for time of possession. The UTEP model in non-conference play is similar to that of Northwestern’s approach. The Miners ran it almost 50 times last Saturday to just 13 pass attempts. However in this game the Miners will need their passing game to be somewhat relevant.  INU: What’s been the biggest challenge for the Miners on offense this year as they adjust to a new coordinator and who in particular could step up and build momentum for the group on Saturday? AB: The biggest challenge on offense — or around their team — is adjusting to adversity and trying to have success on the road. UTEP is 12-3 over the last three seasons at home but they are just 4-15 on the road in that same stretch. They are a completely different team when they leave El Paso but a win on Saturday could change that.  The offensive coordinator swap isn’t a big deal. Scotty Ohara was simply promoted from being the sole receivers coach. But everyone around UTEP knows that head coach Dana Dimel calls all of the plays. This offseason Dimel prioritized staying in quarterback meetings and working more closely with quarterback Gavin Hardison.  As for the entire team it can draw momentum from its star players — running back Deion Hankins linebacker Tyrice Knight and pass rusher Praise Amaewhule. When those three are playing well usually good things happen for the Miners. Not to mention the run game might’ve found a three-man tandem between Hankins Mike Franklin and Torrance Burgess Jr. in last week’s win.  INU: Give us your score prediction — who wins and why? AB: Northwestern 31 UTEP 28: I’ve been around this program all my life. They haven’t beaten a Power Five opponent since their 1967 Sun Bowl win against Ole Miss. Even though the oddsmakers favor UTEP slightly there’s no way I can do it until I see it. This is more a pick considering the history rather than looking at UTEP and Northwestern on paper.      \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

While NU is capable of knocking off a non-Power Five school like UTEP at home it’s far from a sure thing. The Miners already have one win and they’ll be looking to make that two against a Big Ten school they undoubtedly view as beatable. They will bring everything they have and an effort similar to last Sunday will not be enough for the ‘Cats to avoid dropping to 0-2.  Here’s three reasons why Northwestern will finally reward its fans with a win and three reasons why the losing streak will live on: Why Northwestern will beat UTEP UTEP doesn’t have the same depth Rutgers had in the passing attack Rutgers had 163 yards receiving against Northwestern spread around between a remarkable eight different targets. UTEP has a talented 1000-yard guy in senior Tyrin Smith and he’s likely to give the Northwestern secondary trouble but there isn’t much behind him. Additionally if there was one unit that showed at least an inkling of promise last week for Northwestern it was the secondary. Garnett Hollis Jr. was out there flying around and hitting people hard. Devin Turner when he wasn’t dropping game-changing interceptions played a really good game. There were things to like and things to build upon as the ‘Cats enter Week Two. If the ‘Cats can make life hard for UTEP quarterback Gavin Hardison through the air they neutralize what he brings to the table. The senior is not at all a running quarterback; 2022 was his first season with a positive number of rushing yards at just 76. If the young talent in NU’s secondary doesn’t lay an egg it should provide an advantage.  Ben Bryant probably isn’t as bad as his stat line looked Bryant looked rough in his first taste of Big Ten action but this is still a guy who threw for 21 touchdowns to seven picks last season at Cincinnati. Coach David Braun said they’ll stick with Bryant against UTEP and it seems like the right call. Even with Brendan Sullivan waiting in the wings replacing Bryant this early is essentially giving up on him ever being good in a Wildcat uniform. He deserves a larger sample size. Against Rutgers Bryant made some throws over the middle that had some serious zip. They were throws that nobody else in this Northwestern quarterback room is capable of making. The problem was he was also throwing it behind a lot of receivers and when the game got away from him he made some unwise passes that led to interceptions. But Bryant had pressure in his face all afternoon from the Rutgers’ defensive front and it seems likely that UTEP’s pass rush will be more manageable for Northwestern’s offensive line.  Bryant’s receiving corps is also entirely new to him and mostly new to Northwestern. He missed Cam Johnson on multiple plays where the Arizona State transfer had created separation and should have been an easy target. Hopefully Bryant and Johnson have looked at those plays and learned something from them. Because he didn’t seem to have enough rapport with his receivers Bryant was never in rhythm against Rutgers. Part of that was on him and part of it was on pass protection but he needs to figure out how to get in rhythm against UTEP. A better version of Bryant gives the ‘Cats a much higher chance to come out of this weekend with a needed victory. A.J. Henning Since the Northwestern offense sputtered so much it was hard to get a good look at a lot of the new skill position talent. However one guy who did manage to stand out was receiver and return specialist A.J. Henning who transferred to NU from a crowded Michigan receiver room. Henning had a 26-yard reception on the first drive of the game. He also took a hand off on the second drive for a seven yard gain showcasing his versatility. His numbers weren’t gaudy but the offense was so stagnant that it would have been hard for him to put up an impressive stat line. He passed the eye test though and we didn’t even get to see him show off his most proven skill: returning kicks. There were quite a few fair catch situations on Sunday. Henning is an electric returner but he wasn’t given a chance to shine in that regard. Look for him to do so against UTEP. Why Northwestern won’t beat UTEP The defensive line created virtually zero pressure against Rutgers Northwestern had no sacks in its opener against the Scarlet Knights and the pass rush was truly awful. Gavin Wimsatt had all day in the pocket and it didn’t matter how long the ‘Cats’ secondary could lock up his receivers. He always had time to wait until someone popped open. Northwestern rotated through linemen a lot but nothing worked.  While Hardison doesn’t have a ton of receiving talent to rely on it won’t matter much if he’s under no pressure for the entire game. He can just wait until Smith works his way into open space. Theoretically this UTEP offensive line should be an easier matchup but the pass rush was so abysmal last week that it’s still a huge concern headed into this week. This unit doesn’t feel like something that can be turned around in one week and it’s a glaring weakness. Cam Porter and the non-existent running game As a team the ‘Cats have 12 total rushing yards on the season (that does include Bryant’s -15 from getting sacked). The team leader is Sullivan who played only one drive against Rutgers and starting running back Cam Porter finished with just eight yards on six carries. Yeesh. You don’t win football games especially as a bad team with that kind of production from your running game. The offensive line is poor yes but it feels like the numbers are starting to stack up against Porter. The senior had a middling to concerning junior campaign last year backing up Evan Hull rushing for 286 yards on only 3.3 yards per carry. But he’s a big physical back and the glass-half-full thought process was that he’d show improvement when he was handed the starting job this offseason. Unfortunately it looked like more of the same from Porter on Sunday. He wasn’t hitting holes and he also had some head-scratching missed blocks. In his defense only giving your starting running back six carries is also not a winning formula or conducive to his success individually. For that reason it’s not time to write off Porter or the Northwestern running game just yet but it’s certainly time to be concerned about it. UTEP will be hungry for a win Northwestern is desperate for a win but that’s different than being hungry for one. The Miners aren’t stupid. They’re headed into this one knowing they have a chance to knock off a Big Ten team. They’ll be motivated and ready to go come Saturday. The ‘Cats have to find a way to win the mental game. Desperation isn’t going to trump motivation. It’s up to Braun and the rest of his staff to wipe away the Rutgers game and forget about all of the losing last year. They just need to focus on winning this one. If they can’t UTEP is going to come into Evanston with all the swagger and all the energy and the game will be over before it starts. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story What have we learned about Northwestern Women’s Soccer through six games? That they’re good. Oh you wanted more than that? That riveting breakdown wasn’t enough? I guess I can give you more insight then. Northwestern women’s soccer (4-0-2) is off to one of the hottest starts in program history making good progress toward another NCAA Tournament run. For the first time since 2018 the 20th-ranked Wildcats are unbeaten through their first six games. They’ve scored 20 goals in six games. Mind you that the program record is 52 set in in 1997. Right now the ‘Cats are on pace to score 60. On the flip side they’ve only let up four goals to opponents tallying four shutouts in the process. The fewest they’ve ever allowed in a season is seven in 2016 so it would take an impressive effort to stay below that. Never say never with this team though. This early season success has come in part from Michael Moynihan finding his squad. He trotted out the same eleven — Reiley Fitzpatrick Nicole Doucette Aurea del Carmen Josie Aulicino Caterina Regazzoni Emma Phillips Holland Carey Ingrid Falls Ella Hase Danika Austin and Meg Boade — for the first five games only making a change when forced to by an injury to Aulicino. Speaking of Aulicino she has looked like one of the best players in the country through her five games played. She’s scored four goals and notched six assists tying the team lead in both categories. Her six assists are also tied for first in the Big Ten alongside teammate Boade who herself is on pace for another All-Big Ten First Team season with three goals and six assists. This duo has led the offense but they have not been alone. Including them 10 different players have scored. That includes Hase who has scored four goals doubling her career total and del Carmen who has two goals and two assists. Those four aforementioned players have each registered a goal and an assist in a match with Boade doing it three times and Aulicino notching three of each in a game. On the defensive side of the ball the returning back line of Austin Phillips and Doucette has performed as advertised. They’ve partnered with Fitzpatrick in net and it seems like the sophomore has all but locked up the starting goalkeeper job. She’s made 12 saves while allowing only four goals playing all but 30 minutes. If she can keep this level of play up the Northwestern goal will be safe for the next few years. Lastly the new crop of first years have been pulling their weight. Four different first years have appeared in at least one game with Carey turning herself into a bona fide starter cracking the XI in all six games. Carey made an impact with her first ever touch in her first ever start setting up Northwestern’s first goal of the season. Megan Norkett has also appeared in every game tallying a goal and assist. The ‘Cats are in about a good as a position as they can be as Big Ten play creeps up. If you’re not paying attention to this team you should. This fall at Martin Stadium will continue to be very fun. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Welcome to the first edition of Inside NU’s weekly quarterback film room where we will break down the good the bad and mostly the ugly from the week before.  Northwestern has not scored double digits since October last year and 2023 has been less than stellar for NU’s offense. For the fourth straight year the Wildcats had a new signal-caller under center to start the season. This time it was Ben Bryant who transferred to Evanston this spring after spending 2022 as the starter for Cincinnati. In Bryant’s first appearance in purple and white it was a slog of a performance. Factor in that the run game was nonexistent he was pressured 17 times and it makes it a tough debut for the transfer. By the time Bryant and the rest of the starters were pulled from the game with two minutes left the ‘Cats trailed 24-0 and had failed to reach the redone at any point in the contest. To be blunt it was bad football to watch. So if you are sicko and want to rewatch this game too let’s dive into the film. The Numbers Bryant finished his first game with the Wildcats completing 20 of 36 passes for 169 yards no touchdowns and two interceptions. While Bryant did complete over 50% of his passes his PFF passing grade was a meager 30.1 for his performance in Piscataway. Only Cole Freeman finished with a lower PFF grade last season.  While Bryant’s completion rating was barely over 50% PFF has his adjusted completion rating (completions + drops) was 67.6%. While his yards per completion fell under five yards Bryant’s average passing attempt was roughly 10 yards down the field. He had two Big Time Throws which PFF classifies as a pass with excellent ball location and timing generally thrown further down the field and/or into a tighter window. The arm strength is there but the sixth-year transfer struggled when facing the heat this past weekend. Rutgers seemed to live in Northwestern’s backfield last Sunday forcing Bryant to get rid of the ball quicker than wanted. No. 2 was sacked five times and had roughly 2.7 seconds to get rid of the Football. While the sixth-year completed 65% of passes with a clean pocket he found a receiver just three times of his 17 dropbacks under duress. When No. 2 was under pressure on Sunday he held on to the ball for over three seconds; comparatively when the pocket was clean Bryant got the ball out of his hands in under 2.5 seconds. On the NFL passer rating which scales from zero to 158.3 Bryant scored 6.3 when under pressure.  ""The numbers confirm what was already known about Bryant heading into the 2023 season: he is a true pocket passer with limited ability to improvise. With NU’s offensive line struggling to find its way it is tough sledding for the Cincinnati transfer. The tape is a pretty accurate representation of the numbers so lets dive into the film."" The Good While it was not a pretty NU debut for Bryant he did have some bright spots. There was a reason he won the starting job and he displayed those traits on Sunday. One of the things college quarterbacks struggle with is making their way from A through D of their reads. Many lock onto the first read and if it is not open instantly go to the check down or try to run. Bryant on the other hand showed his ability to find his second target and move the chains. This is a good job by Bryant working back to the weak side of the field. After taking the snap No. 2 shoots his eyes to the right side of the field looking at the first read in the progression. After realizing No. 1 is covered the Northwestern QB hitches twice and gets his eyes and hips towards Cam Johnson his second option and Bryant rifles a ball into Johnson on the post-curl. Despite the good coverage from RU Bryant understands that his primary option is unavailable so he rapidly works his way through his reads to find the open target. This is a prime example of Bryant’s strength as a QB: however in this clip he had ample time to get rid of the ball. When protected Bryant showed the ability to fit the ball in between defenders. Bryant was able to put the ball where only his receiver could get it creating chunk plays for the Wildcats. In his second play as the ‘Cats’ gunslinger Bryant unleashed an absolute seed for a huge play to A.J. Henning. Henning who is running a deep crosser creates enough separation between the corner and the high safety ranging over from the middle of the field. However the ball has to be perfect in order to be completed and it was. After a clean drop and hitch Bryant lofts the ball just out of the underneath corner’s reach and drops it into the awaiting arms of Henning before the safety can knock it away. It is a risky throw but one that Bryant made look easy. The 26-yard pickup gave a glimpse into what the duo of transfers could do this season and if they can keep finding open space NU will move the ball this season. This is the Ben Bryant that was advertised. This pass should not have been completed as the hook linebacker is in the perfect spot to make a play on the ball and the safety is sitting and waiting to jump a pass over the middle. That does not phase Bryant though as he zips a fastball right by the linebacker to Johnson on the slant for a fresh set of downs. The speed of the ball out of his hand is absurd as the defenders barely have time to react before the ball is in Johnson’s hands. This clip is another example of what Bryant can do with a clean pocket but keeping him upright is a lot easier said than done. The Bad Let’s be honest Sunday may have been one of the worst games of Bryant’s career. There were plenty of lowlights for No. 2 this past weekend but mistakes that can definitely be cleaned up.  While Bryant did a good job of working through his progression throughout the game he sometimes found himself locked to one target. His eyes led defenders right to the football halting the minuscule amount of positive momentum that the Wildcats’ offense gained. Even though the game was out of hand by then this was the worst throw of the game from Bryant. Rutgers came out in a simple Cover 2 look and the Wildcats ran four verticals down the field. In Cover 2 quarterbacks are told to take a hole shot which is a high-velocity pass in the space between the corner and the safety and Bryant tries to do exactly that.  However No. 2 locks his eyes on Cam Johnson allowing the underneath corner to read the QB drift back right into the vacated space and make the easy interception. Everyone on the field knew where the sixth-year wanted to go with the ball and Rutgers made him pay. I would have liked to see Bryant set his feet get his weight to his front hip and deliver the ball with more pace beating the defender to the spot. Bryant said postgame that he tried to aim it instead of just letting it loose but disguising his target and moving the corner would have aided him as well. In this clip Bryant never even looks away from his first read even though the WR is covered and the backside is wide open. The sixth-year is waiting and holding the ball for way too long allowing the pressure to finally flush him from the pocket. Had he realized that his first read was smothered he could have continued through his progression and found the tight end on the hitch for an easy five-yard completion; instead Bryant is forced to scramble and takes a massive and avoidable hit from a defender. He nearly injured himself because he did not go through his progression to find the open receiver. When half the field is eliminated it makes it much easier on the defense. Bryant has shown his ability to go through his progression but he needs to do it more consistently. One of the best things a QB can do is lead his receivers and put the ball in space for them to run after the catch. However on numerous occasions last Sunday Bryant was behind his pass-catchers making it incredibly difficult for them to haul in the throw. After the 26-yard completion to Henning Northwestern had a the Scarlet Knights reeling and had a chance to drive down the field and score. However this misfire from No. 2 sputtered the drive. This a great play call from Mike Bajakian who used Rutgers’ aggressive linebackers against them having an RPO slant in the vacated space. Johnson is wide open with plenty of room to run after the catch but Bryant sails him behind. Johnson attempts to leap and contort his body to haul it in but the ball is out of reach. The sixth-year’s footwork is good but he does not get his arm all the way forward. If Bryant puts the ball on target NU easily picks up a first down or even more; instead the ‘Cats fell behind the sticks and had to punt the ball away. This is another drive-killing misfire from Bryant. On a third-and-long Johnson runs a hitch just past the line to gain and with the corner playing off Johnson had plenty of space for an easy pitch-and-catch. Bryant with a clean pocket just misses. His footwork is good his weight is on his front hip but he’s behind his WR. It is possible that No. 2 thought Johnson was going to turn outward and tried to put it on his outside shoulder but that is a pass that has to be completed. NU did not have many opportunities to possess the ball in the first half and missing on third down conversions did not give the Wildcats a chance to make it a competitive game. In a game where the ‘Cats barely possessed the ball it needed to capitalize on the few chances it had to change the momentum of the game. However each time it looked like NU was putting something together it would fail to capitalize on the game-changing play that would swing the momentum. It is hard to nitpick a 45-yard pass because that is a hard throw; however connecting on these passes is the difference between winning and losing Big Ten games. Henning has his man beat and if he is hit in stride there is a good chance he takes it to the house putting NU back in the game to start the second half. Because Bryant sailed it over No. 8’s head Northwestern had to punt again. I love the aggressiveness I love the decision to let it fly but it just needs to be executed. At some point this season the pair will link up for a deep touchdown. If you know me you know how insane this drives me. This is a simple RPO with a bubble and on the outside NU has three and Rutgers has two defenders. Sure there is a high safety but he is not making this play. On third-and-4 all you need is a first down. When the offense has three and the defense has two get the ball to the three. This ball should have been out on the snap to Jacob Gill who could easily pick up a fresh set of downs.  NU does a really good job of cross-blocking for the screen putting the tight end on the corner. If Gill gets the ball he only has a safety to beat. Instead the Wildcats try to run the ball up the gut and Cam Porter gets demolished in the backfield. On the ensuing play Northwestern turns it over on downs. It is a minute difference but one that may lead to points.  Bryant has to recognize the advantage and get the ball to his playmakers in space. Is this one of my pet peeves? Absolutely. But is it something that a sixth-year quarterback should see? Absolutely. The ‘Cats moved the ball well but continued to sputter when they got into Rutgers’ territory. These missed opportunities are a big reason why the first team offense failed to get on the scoreboard last Sunday in Piscataway. Final Thoughts It was not a pretty debut for Bryant and he has owned up to that. However on the second watch back he did not play as poorly as I remember it being from the press box last Sunday. With very little help from his offensive line Bryant constantly found himself on the turf in the second half hampering his ability to display his strength.  He needs to cut down on the miscues but having a run game should help. It will be interesting to see how he performs against UTEP tomorrow but ‘Cats fans should not lose all hope in the sixth-year just yet. If he is protected which is a major if he can be a productive quarterback. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In their home opener Friday night at Welsh-Ryan Arena the Wildcats throttled in-state opponent Illinois State in straight sets. Despite the home win the ‘Cats are still trying to find their way in 2023 losing to UW-Milwaukee and falling to under .500.

Senior setter Alexa Rousseau was in sync with her hitters tallying 28 assists over the course of the match. She contributed on offense and defense as well landing a service ace and racking up eight digs. Dodson and first-year Drew Wright contributed at the service line as well dropping two service aces each. Although Northwestern never fell behind in the first set blazing past the opposition 25-8 Illinois State kept the score close at various points in the second and third sets. The ‘Cats found themselves up by a score of 18-17 before sophomore Averie Hernandez came off the bench and landed a service ace. That was the spark the team needed as they went on a rally scoring seven of the set’s final eight points to win 25-19. The third set saw even less separation between the Wildcats and Redbirds with the score even at 17-17 before Randorf and Dodson’s play at the net closed out the set 25-22 and secured the match win. In opposition to the domination at the net for Northwestern Illinois State had its fair share of missed opportunities committing 17 errors on the night. Nevertheless Northwestern evened up its record at 2-2 before heading up north to face the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee on Monday. It was a tale of two matches for the Wildcats over the holiday weekend. Excellent hitting and opponent mistakes were the main factors for Northwestern’s victory over Illinois State. However its Monday match against Milwaukee was plagued by self-inflicted errors. Northwestern found itself down early trailing 16-8 in the first set. While the team made multiple runs to cut the deficit to 22-18 and later 24-23 Milwaukee closed out the set one point later with a kill. The second set saw a high point for the Wildcats. They used the momentum that got them close to winning the first set to help them jump out to a big lead. Courtesy of five kills from Chinn Northwestern was able to build a commanding 11-3 lead. That lead was never in jeopardy as the ‘Cats wrapped up the set 25-14 evening the match. Unfortunately for the Wildcats 14 total errors over the next two sets largely factored into the team’s loss. Northwestern found itself in a back-and-forth battle in the third set staying even with the Panthers at 11-11 and even having a two-point lead at 15-13. However Milwaukee responded back scoring five unanswered points later in the set to take a 20-16 lead. The Panthers wouldn’t relinquish that lead taking the set 25-22.  Northwestern found itself tied 16-16 in the fourth set but following two Milwaukee kills and a pair of Northwestern errors the Panthers jumped out to a 20-16 lead. The ‘Cats then battled to take a 23-22 lead but after a sequence that saw the Panthers score on a kill a service ace and another kill Milwaukee put an end to the match winning the fourth set 25-23. Although Northwestern dropped this match three Wildcats scored double-digit kills with Chinn leading the team with 17 kills. Of the three sets the Wildcats lost two of them were only by two points and the other by three points. In those losing sets they committed eight eight and six errors. At this time last year the team was 6-0. However this year Northwestern finds itself at 2-3 and committing more errors than their opponents.  Northwestern heads to Boston Massachusetts for the Northeastern Invitational. There the team will play against Northern Colorado on Friday afternoon and against host Northeastern on Saturday afternoon. The Wildcats will finish off the weekend playing against Fairfield at their opponent’s home in Fairfield Connecticut. That game will start at 12 p.m. CT.

Share this story After a rough 24-7 opening week loss against Rutgers Northwestern desperately needed a bounce-back against UTEP. The Wildcats were able to do that rallying behind a few fourth-down stops and turnovers forced by the defense to post a dominant 38-7 victory over UTEP. Everything looked better for Northwestern which claimed the program’s first win since the 2022 season-opening win over Nebraska in Ireland and the first win on American soil since a 21-7 victory over Rutgers on Oct. 16 2021. Here’s what we learned from the contest. Stock up: Cam Porter Porter had a very quiet week against Rutgers with just eight yards on six carries on the ground. Porter was involved in the passing game last week tallying four receptions for 26 yards but his overall impact was felt more in this game. Porter’s first six carries (all in the first half) gave him 29 rushing yards early and he also hauled in two receptions for 14 yards as well. He stayed productive throughout the rest of the game ending with 17 carries for 90 yards as the main player in a Northwestern rushing attack that tallied 182 yards on 37 carries (4.9 yards per carry) with three touchdowns after only gaining 12 rushing yards on 22 carries against Rutgers. Porter will have to be effective if Northwestern is going to win more games this season and this game was a sign that he is more than up for that challenge. Ben Bryant Bryant had a rough Week One performance ending the game 20-for-36 with 169 yards and two interceptions. He bounced back against UTEP with much greater efficiency ending the game 11-for-17 with 116 passing yards and a touchdown through the air while also tallying a rushing touchdown on a sneak without throwing any interceptions this week. His yards per attempt improved from 4.7 to 6.8 and everything felt a lot smoother on the offensive end when compared to Northwestern’s Week One — where it always felt like the Wildcats’ offense was stuck in neutral all game. Bryant exited the game with an injury after his rushing touchdown but his Week Two performance showed a lot of much-needed improvement after what happened in Week One. Mike Bajakian’s gameplan Last week Bajakian found himself on the wrong end of the stock report as Northwestern failed to get points on the board until the game was virtually over already. This weekend both of Northwestern’s first two touchdowns were well-designed trick plays. The first touchdown which came on the opening drive of the game was scored by quarterback Jack Lausch on a run with Ben Bryant also on the field in motion. The two-quarterback look caught UTEP sleeping and Northwestern capitalized to get its touchdown. Also the Wildcats ran a lot of screens for a good portion of the game and NU played off of that at the end of the first drive of the second half. Bryant then pump-faked a screen to A.J. Henning and instead threw to a wide-open Thomas Gordon — who started the play by lining up as a blocker but then ran up the seam to make a touchdown catch. Overall the offense looked a lot more balanced as the ‘Cats scored more than 24 points in a game for the first time since the 2022 season-opening victory over Nebraska. Honorable Mentions: the linebackers the defensive line A.J. Henning Ryan Hilinski Cam Johnson Stock down: Northwestern’s secondary Overall this game will look like a good one defensively but the two interceptions skew the optics a little bit. After being arguably the best Northwestern unit on the field in Week One giving up just 163 yards to Gavin Wimsatt and Rutgers through the air in the season opener UTEP quarterback Gavin Hardison was 14-for-19 with 147 passing yards in the first half. The two interceptions thrown in the game were also courtesy of linebackers Xander Mueller and Bryce Gallagher. Even when Northwestern’s pass defense had its better moments the secondary was not at the heart of it like it was last week against Rutgers. This unit still showed a lot of promise in Week One; however and a bounce-back week from the secondary in next week would not be a surprise. Special teams This one is a little bit nit-picky but Northwestern had a few opportunities to improve field position via special teams plays that were not made. The first of those plays came when Northwestern executed perfectly to position itself for a punt block but then failed to actually come up with that block. A few UTEP returns also got farther up the field than they should have due to some missed tackles; if Northwestern makes those same mistakes against the Big Ten teams that are much more athletic than UTEP those teams will likely make the Wildcats pay with some big returns.

Share this story Northwestern fans take a deep breath. For the first time in what feels like an eternity Northwestern has reason to celebrate. And man was Saturday afternoon in Evanston a celebration.  The Wildcats (1-1 0-1 B1G) put on a show in their home opener treating the crowd to a 38-7 victory over visiting UTEP (1-2 0-1 C-USA). In the process Northwestern snapped a 12-game losing skid and 693-day streak without a win on American soil. The win also marks the first victory in David Braun’s tenure as head coach. There was so much to applaud for on a picturesque day at Ryan Field as the Wildcats put up 38 unanswered points highlighted by a second half that saw Northwestern outscore UTEP 31-0 in the second half. The defense led the charge early on holding the Miners scoreless after their opening possession of the game. The unit looked cohesive and physical racking up nine tackles for loss four sacks and three interceptions. Offensively Cam Porter bulldozed his way to 90 rushing yards (104 all-purpose yards). A.J. Henning finished with 51 total yards Jack Lausch and Joseph Himon II added 53 and 91 yards respectively and all three players found the end zone. Ben Bryant before being taken out of the game with an injury looked solid completing 11-of-17 passes for 116 yards and a touchdown. In his relief Ryan Hilinski and Jack Lausch each saw time. Perhaps the most important stat for the offense: zero turnovers. After winning the toss Northwestern elected to defer. With the help of an offsides penalty on the kickoff the Miners found themselves across midfield before a minute of the game had passed. UTEP gained chunk play after chunk play as quarterback Gavin Hardison showed off his arm and his legs including a 16-yard run on a read option play that faked out the entire stadium. The drive was capped off with a four-yard touchdown pass to tight end Zach Fryar. Northwestern was not able to even force a third down on the drive as the Miners raced to a 7-0 lead before anyone in the stands could even take a breath.  In an early hole Ben Bryant and the offense got to work showcasing quick tempo with a Cam Porter run and Bryce Kirtz screen that gained a first down on the senior’s first snag of the season. A personal foul on UTEP put the ball into enemy territory which was quickly followed by an A.J. Henning end around. The speed of the transfer receiver was on full display as the Wildcats marched into the red zone as quickly as their opponent had the previous drive. On second and goal Jack Lausch took a direct snap and outraced the UTEP defense to the right pylon of the end zone to even the score. The play came from an odd formation that positioned quarterback Bryant in motion as a second quarterback and included a fake handoff up the middle putting the Miner linebackers out of position. On the following UTEP drive Northwestern forced its first third down of the day but with a clean pocket Hardison had enough time to find Fryar once again for a conversion right at the sticks. Quickly the home team was able to force another third-and-long situation yet the result was the same: Hardison had plenty of daylight in the pocket and was able to convert via air with a 12-yard completion to Kelly Akharaiyi. Once more the Wildcats forced a third-and-long with the Miners needing 13 yards to convert. Hardison completed what appeared to be a first down completion to Jeremiah Ballard but Ballard had stepped out of bounds in his route making the completion an illegal touching play. UTEP subsequently punted in a much-needed stop for Northwestern. The ‘Cats unable to convert a third-and-long of their own booted the ball back to the visitors. At the end of the first UTEP neared midfield with the score knotted. Out of the break the Wildcat defense held firm to force a punt where a Northwestern holding penalty backed the offense up inside the five-yard line. After starting with four straight completions Bryant went cold tossing four straight incomplete passes before finding an in-breaking Cam Johnson for a huge gain on third down. On the play Johnson broke several tackles and sprinted across the field for a 43-yard pickup. Shortly after a second-down sack all but ended a promising Wildcat drive as Hunter Renner punted for the second consecutive possession. Yet again the Miners were able to trudge their way to Northwestern’s midfield logo but David Braun’s defense stiffened on third and six Bryce Gallagher read Hardison like a book dropping into zone coverage and picking off the Miner passer for the defense’s first takeaway of the 2023 season. Despite the favorable field position Northwestern went three-and-out as Maurice Westmoreland bludgeoned through the right side of the Wildcat offensive line for a third down sack. The teams continued to mirror each other as Anto Saka burst through UTEP’s protection unit for a third down sack of his own the first in the career of the highly-touted recruit. After a Northwestern three-and-out Gavin Hardison aired one out to Ballard just before halftime. The 6-foot-3 receiver came down with the ball with 17 seconds left right at the edge of field goal range. Another quick completion to Akharaiyi set the Miners up for a field goal attempt in the waning seconds of the second quarter. The 44-yard attempt off Buzz Flabiano’s right leg sailed wide right to extend the combined scoreless possession streak to nine. A kneel sent the two teams into the locker room tied up at seven apiece with the only scores coming on each team’s opening possession.  By half Hardison had already completed more passes than he attempted in UTEP’s previous game against Incarnate Word but Northwestern’s defense held the potent Miner rushing attack to 4.1 yards per carry just one week after UTEP totaled 329 yards on the ground. To start the third quarter Northwestern picked up three first downs utilizing the speedster Henning in a variety of ways. On one third down Mike Bajakian motioned the receiver across the formation before running a slant that moved the chains. A few plays later Henning took a jet sweep for a handful of yards to move the chains once again. From there Northwestern pounded the rock on five straight snaps to enter the red zone. On second-and-10 Bryant found tight end Thomas Gordon wide open to put the ‘Cats on top. The touchdown pass was Bryant’s first in purple as Northwestern took its first lead of the season. With the only scores coming on opening drives out of the locker room UTEP looked to repeat the success it found in the opening minutes of the game and respond with a touchdown. On the first play of the drive a 22-yard Hardison-to-Akharaiyi bullet was negated by a block below the waist penalty. Needing 22 yards to convert Hardison attempted a risky pass to the far right sideline. Xander Mueller was in the right place at the right time marking the second time in the afternoon that a Wildcat linebacker picked off Hardison. Mueller returned the ball all the way to UTEP’s three-yard line. Two plays later Ben Bryant took a QB sneak over the goal line to extend Northwestern’s lead to 14 firing up the crowd at Ryan Field and the home sideline. On the ensuing drive a personal foul brought UTEP close to midfield but the drive petered out after a Coco Azema pass breakup and Aidan Hubbard sack. With all the momentum in Northwestern’s favor an unexpected hiccup arose. With news that Ben Bryant had suffered an upper body injury Ryan Hilinski trotted out with the NU offense. Yet even the continuing quarterback carousel could not stop the purple tidal wave with Hilinski floating a third down screen to Joseph Himon II who bolted untouched down the middle of the field for an 85-yard score that increased the score to 28-7. In desperate need of a spark after giving up 28 unanswered UTEP went for it on a fourth down from its own 33-yard line completing the pass to keep the drive going. A would’ve-been touchdown pass was called back because of UTEP’s second illegal touching penalty of the day. Facing fourth-and-one in the red zone the Miners attempted a QB sneak that was stuffed by Northwestern’s defensive line which stepped up in a big way after a tough start to the season last week in Piscataway.  Hilinski stayed in for the Wildcats but the offensive staff found more creative ways to use reserve quarterback Jack Lausch as he sprung loose for a 46-yard chunk in the fourth quarter. The rushing attack was humming in the fourth quarter capitalized by A.J. Henning’s first touchdown in purple on a jet sweep. Now fully in garbage time Ezell Jolly was stuffed on another fourth-and-one opportunity giving the ‘Cats the ball on a turnover on downs. Jack Lausch took over at quarterback from there shedding his gadget-only role. He led the team on a quick drive capped off by a 40-yard Jack Olsen field goal the first make of his career. With under a minute to go Joe DeHaan intercepted Jake McNamara to seal the win for Northwestern. The Wildcats will return to action against the No. 21 Duke Blue Devils in Durham North Carolina.

Share this story Following a less-than-anticipated showing in its debut Northwestern football seeks a victory in America for the first time in nearly two years. The Wildcats’ Week Two foe might prove to be its best shot at erasing that streak in the Conference USA UTEP Miners. Our staff writers are somewhat bullish on NU doing just that but some are still not convinced that the program’s loss streak will finally end. Iggy Dowling: Northwestern 20 UTEP 17 The 693-day streak ends here. It would be really nice to have a proven run game to control this one from the beginning but I think the ‘Cats will have enough threats through the air in A.J. Henning Cam Johnson and (potentially healthy?) Bryce Kirtz. Someone will make a big play or two and the Northwestern secondary looked good enough against Rutgers to trust that it won’t give up too many backbreaking plays. Then again this UTEP team has played Incarnate Word before heading to Evanston just like a certain 2022 team... Bradley Locker: Northwestern 20 UTEP 13 The Miners aren’t a team to sleep on despite their non-Power Five conference status; they’re ranked 24th among all FBS teams in overall PFF grade through two games. Yet I still think Northwestern is a more talented team than UTEP especially with its skill position room and secondary. While turnovers were one of the major pitfalls of the Wildcats’ losses to lower-level opponents in 2022 David Braun and Mike Bajakian could employ a more conservative gameplan relying on Cam Porter and Anthony Tyus with some chunk plays to A.J. Henning and Cam Johnson sprinkled in. The Wildcat defense also capitalizes on its turnover opportunities including picking off Gavin Hardison. NU looked bad against Rutgers but not bad enough for me to change course based on my preseason prediction of making this a win. Jake Mozarsky: Northwestern 23 UTEP 14 Even though UTEP has looked solid throughout its first two games this is the first game in a while where you can confidently say Northwestern is the more talented team. Depending on Mike Bajakian’s gameplan I think the Northwestern offense will find it easier to execute against a Miner defense that is worse than Rutgers’. Ben Bryant was not as bad as his stats look and A.J. Henning and Cam Johnson can both thrive in the passing game while Cam Porter will have a better game on the ground. On the defensive side of the ball it’s going to come down to turnovers and the secondary had its chances last week against Gavin Wimsatt. This week they hopefully can capitalize and Northwestern wins in America! Ethan Segall: UTEP 16 Northwestern 14 The movement on the spread for this game has been a roller coaster of its own. Northwestern opened as a favorite last week but after the ‘Cats’ loss last week UTEP became the favorite. Now the line is back to Northwestern -1 but if you were thinking about betting on this game I have some advice for you: don’t. Just don’t. This game will be grueling enough to watch without having additional money on the line. Anyways I’m picking the Miners to get their first Power Five win since the 1967 Sun Bowl against Ole Miss. If last week is any indication Deion Hankins and this rushing attack will give this Northwestern defense problems behind a really solid offensive line.  David Gold: Northwestern 20 UTEP 13 I don’t know why I am picking this because I have so little faith in this program yet here I am. It has been nearly 700 days since NU won on American soil and UTEP has not won against a Power Five opponent in nearly 60 years. It would be the least surprising thing if the Wildcats were the team to finally break that streak. I said on Pound the Talk that Northwestern has to block and tackle but that is a major if. The only reason I’m picking the ‘Cats to win is I think A.J. Henning is better than any C-USA corner and Ben Bryant will respond to last week’s debacle with a solid performance. Add in an interception by the Wildcats’ secondary and Northwestern will finally be able to sing the fight song in Ryan Field for the first time in nearly two years. Natalie Wells: Northwestern 17 UTEP 13 Ben Bryant and the ‘Cats’ offense simply melted in the New Jersey heat last week. The season opener was their best chance at stealing a Big Ten win but they just couldn’t string together consistent drives. Bryant threw two picks Cam Porter averaged 1.3 yards per carry and Brendan Sullivan led the team in rushing yards. None of those statistics are particularly encouraging. The defensive line didn’t record a single sack putting an unfair amount of pressure on the secondary. Bryce Gallagher and company need to buckle down against UTEP back Deion Hankins who ripped off 174 rushing yards in a win against Incarnate Word. If Northwestern’s offense milks the clock and plays turnover-free football I think it can scrape together its first American win in nearly 700 days. My remaining shred of hope is completely indefensible but I’m not willing to give up on Braun’s squad just yet. John Olsen: UTEP 27 Northwestern 14 Res ipsa loquitur. Ascher Levin: Northwestern 21 UTEP 14 After an embarrassing loss to Rutgers Northwestern is looking to rebound against UTEP. The Miners are one of the easiest remaining opponents on Northwestern’s schedule so this is a good opportunity for the Wildcats. UTEP has played two games so far this season: losing against Jacksonville State and beating Incarnate Word. The Miners ran for 329 yards in their last game against Incarnate Word and it is key for Northwestern to be able to stop the run. On the offensive side Coach Braun said that Ben Bryant will remain as the starting quarterback. Bryant didn’t have much time to process the field against Rutgers as the offensive line struggled mightily; however he has to improve his accuracy for Northwestern to be successful. Even though my miniscule confidence in the team is dwindling Northwestern should be able to secure their first win of the season. Brendan Preisman: Northwestern 16 UTEP 13 I said this would be a Wildcats win in my preseason predictions and I’m sticking to that. UTEP is 1-1 after losing to Jacksonville State and beating FCS Incarnate Word but those games don’t say too much about how they’ll do against a team that’s technically a Power Five squad. Northwestern was utterly dominated in the trenches but the one saving grace should be that UTEP is a much worse team on both lines than Rutgers. The Miners gave up 208 rushing yards to Jacksonville State in their loss so the Wildcats have a blueprint. Assuming the Wildcats will be able to rush for better than 12 total yards (like they did against Rutgers) Northwestern will more than likely be able to win this one. If NU can’t...let’s just say the stadium won’t be the only thing getting demolished in the next few years. Jeremy Song: Northwestern 21 UTEP 17 The biggest X-factor for Northwestern in this game would have to be the offensive line. We saw how abysmal the offense could be last Sunday where Ben Bryant had almost no time to throw the ball because the pocket kept collapsing. If the offensive line can step up against the UTEP defensive line this team definitely has enough talent to beat the Miners. Northwestern’s defense played its hearts out last Sunday and limited a supposedly good Rutgers running game to 122 yards on a 2.8 YPC average. If it can continue playing well against the run against Deion Hankins and this stout UTEP rushing attack I see a path for the Wildcats to win their first game this season.  Adam Beck: UTEP 20 Northwestern 10 Although this game is certainly winnable for Northwestern the truth is there wasn’t a lot to be optimistic about last weekend. Although the ‘Cats won’t be facing a Power Five opponent I’m not convinced they’ll be any more successful than their Week One letdown in Piscataway. Against Rutgers Northwestern’s defense couldn’t get off the field and with UTEP’s dangerous rushing attack able to churn out long time-consuming drives I’m worried about Northwestern being able to gain any momentum. An early touchdown on the Miners’ opening drive and this Northwestern squad might have trouble getting things going. John Ferrara: UTEP 24 Northwestern 16 I’ve never been quite so down on a football team as I am on Northwestern after last week’s outing versus Rutgers. Aside from a late-game touchdown from the team’s backup quarterback (and David Braun has made it abundantly clear that Ben Bryant will remain the starter over Brendan Sullivan moving forward) we all watched 60 minutes of poor line play from the ‘Cats — both on the offensive and defensive side of the ball. UTEP is fresh off a game against Incarnate Word in which the Miners rushed for over 300 yards. I’d like to think the Cardinals possess a drastically worse defensive front than NU but after 12 straight losses including one that came at the hands of FCS-level Southern Illinois I have a hard time making definitive statements about the ‘Cats. If they are going to grab a win this season this matchup proves to be the most favorable void Howard in Week Six. Who’s to say? I’ve just been scorned too many times by the men in purple. Patrick Winograd: Northwestern 20 UTEP 17 The only prediction I feel sure about in relation to this game is that it will be low-scoring. UTEP scored just 14 points in their season-opening loss to Jacksonville State (which was in the program’s first FBS game) and followed that performance up with 28 points against FCS opponent Incarnate Word. The Miners’ defense limited both opponents to 17 points but averaging 21 points offensively against those opponents doesn’t exactly inspire any confidence in UTEP’s offense. However Northwestern managed to put up just seven meaningless points near the end of the game against Rutgers. Even though this will be a step-up from the first two opponents for UTEP’s defense Northwestern’s offense isn’t likely to get in a shootout. Despite the dismal showing last Sunday I still have Northwestern grinding out a victory in its home opener. Sammy Krimstein: Northwestern 23 UTEP 14 After an abysmal week one showing in Piscataway I have the Wildcats bouncing back in their home opener against UTEP. Despite UTEP’s prowess on the ground during its first two games the athleticism of Northwestern’s linebacking corps led by Bryce Gallagher and Xander Mueller should keep the Miners’ rushing attack in check. Offensively the Wildcats need vast improvement up front. Last week Northwestern only rushed for 12 yards — making it impossible to string together methodical drives. Ben Bryant also consistently found himself under pressure. With more time to throw the football he would hopefully find the rhythm that eluded him in week one.  Noah Poser: Northwestern 20 UTEP 7 Let’s not overthink this one too much. Northwestern is the best team that UTEP has faced to this point and it’s not particularly close. While the Wildcats’ issues have been well-documented thus far they should prove to be a major step-up in competition for the Miners over a Jacksonville State program in its debut FBS season and an FCS school in Incarnate Word. Yes the Wildcats looked bad against Rutgers. But chances are they’ll be able to rush for more yards than they did last week when they managed a measly 12. Of course on the flip side of that there is a fair bit of concern about UTEP’s rushing attack which has proved lethal so far this season averaging 243 yards per game through its first two games. Stopping that ground game will be the key for Northwestern to leave Ryan Field with its first win in the continental U.S. since 2021. Ultimately I believe that the team manages to accomplish that task and start the home slate off on the right foot.

Share this story Northwestern football is a rainbow of chaos. Non-conference play is back today and I’m not sure if there’s a better mantra out there that applies to NU’s history in non-Power Five games. Whether it was 2022 or 2001 the ‘Cats have played some incredibly fun (and ugly) early-season games that have been anything but sure victories. You may be aware of the Sickos Committee (@SickosCommittee) one of the best follows on college football Twitter. Basically they’re a group of fans drawn to weird matchups and games that the general public would consider highly unwatchable. Some examples? Think of what Northwestern-Iowa was hyped up to be in 2022 and what Minnesota-Nebraska actually was last week. Think mistake-filled games that are either low-scoring filled with head-scratching plays or maybe even both. Think of games that make you say out loud “Am I really watching a Division I football game?” It feels like Northwestern tends to find itself in these types of games in non-conference play more often than not especially for a Power Five team. And with UTEP entering the week as the favorite with tickets selling for as low as $1 there’s a chance that everyone could be in store for another one.  With this in mind and Northwestern’s last two non-Power Five games having fit the description of a prime sicko game to a T I felt compelled to look back at the 46 games Northwestern has played in the regular season against non-Power Five teams since 2000 (no Notre Dame and no bowl games). I separated them all into tiers based on how “sicko” they were and ranked them from 46 onward.  This is obviously subjective; my criteria hinges on how chaotic the games were as a whole. That includes in-game circumstances funny stats hilarious mistakes how good Northwestern’s opponent actually was the season they played NU etc. What I’m looking for is the type of game where a fan without a rooting interest flips the game on TV and laughs so hard at what they’re seeing that they cannot change the channel.  It’s also worth noting that I have not watched the large majority of these games in their entirety so I could be massively undervaluing or overvaluing a few. Anyway here we go: Tier Six: The boring blowouts utterly unfunny cases of the better team winning 46. Northwestern 41 Eastern Illinois 0 (2015) 45. Northwestern 33 Southern Illinois 7 (2008) 44. Northwestern 38 South Dakota 7 (2012) 43. Northwestern 28 Rice 6 (2011) 42. Miami (OH) 44 Northwestern 14 (2003) When you think of 11 a.m. at Ryan Field you don’t think of a first-round NFL prospect coming to town from outside of the Big Ten to put on a show. But that’s what Ben Roethlisberger did as he threw for 353 yards and three touchdowns to rout the ‘Cats en route to a 13-1 season. Northwestern also blocked a field goal attempt which warrants this game outranking the four before it. 41. Northwestern 37 Illinois State 3 (2010) After recovering a fumble Illinois State went on to throw a pick on the very next drive. Otherwise this was pretty boring between these two teams... for now. 40. Northwestern 47 Towson 14 (2009) 39. Northwestern 35 Ohio 6 (2021) Ohio’s game-ending 55-yard run to end the shutout bid was just excellent. 38. Northwestern 42 Eastern Illinois (2011) 37. Northwestern 24 Indiana State 6 (2021) Hunter Johnson completed nine of his 16 passes for just 66 yards and Northwestern pounded the rock. Three plays after Xander Mueller recovered a muffed punt in the first half Johnson gave it right back on a fumble of his own. Both teams went 19 minutes trading punts! 36. Northwestern 38 Western Michigan 17 (2013) P.J. Fleck’s team which would go on to finish the 2013 season 1-11 led the No. 17 ‘Cats as late as the second quarter. Its lone win? A thrilling 31-30 victory over UMass another 1-11 team. It ended with the Minutemen trying — and failing — to win the game with a two-point conversion. 35. Northwestern 49 Bowling Green 7 (2017) Northwestern fumbled twice and Bowling Green messed up a kick return that left it inside its own 10-yard line on one possession. 34. Northwestern 35 Northern Illinois 17 (2000) Northern Illinois fumbled not once but twice on the goal line. Tier Five: Neutral good 33. Northwestern 27 Northeastern 0 (2007) If this were any team besides Northeastern this would have been almost dead last. But the NU Bowl is just too good for that. The Huskies got inside the Northwestern 30 four times and didn’t score once. 32. Northwestern 38 Ohio 14 (2005) Northwestern missed two field goals threw a pick six and turned the ball over twice at the goal line while still dropping 38 points. A three-drive sequence near the end of the game was also great: C.J. Bacher fumbled at the goal line followed by an Ohio interception on the next play. After that the ‘Cats got to the eight-yard line with 24 seconds to go faced a fourth-and-7 and went for it up by 24. Bacher got picked in the end zone. 31. Northwestern 37 UNLV 28 (2001) UNLV had an 87-yard kick return on a drive and failed to come away with points as the Rebels got stuffed at the goal line. 30. Northwestern 30 Rice 13 (2010) Rice turned it over four times including a pick-six to linebacker and captain Quentin Davie. Northwestern also fumbled at the goal line. Not sure how this game got a Saturday night time slot but it did. 29. Northwestern 24 Western Illinois 7 (2014) Northwestern blocked a punt in the red zone only for Trevor Siemian to fumble it right back on a strip sack. Western Illinois turned the ball over four times in this one and both teams went a combined 7-for-31 on third downs. Also “Leathernecks” is a team name that fits perfectly for this list in every way. Tier 4.5: Neutral evil 28. Northern Illinois 23 Northwestern 15 (2014) Northwestern blocked an extra point which automatically makes this game awesome. The loss itself would’ve shot this game up a tier or two if the Huskies weren’t actually good; they won the MAC in 2014 and went 11-3. 27. New Hampshire 34 Northwestern 17 (2006) It’s an FCS loss sure and a 17-point defeat at home. But this New Hampshire team held the No. 1 ranking in the FCS for five weeks. Both offenses were relatively normal. Weirdly Northwestern only punted twice in this game. The ‘Cats fumbled twice including once on a kick return and went for it four times unsuccessfully on fourth down. Tier Four: (Mostly) chaotic neutral 26. Northwestern 30 Central Michigan 25 (2010) A 3-9 Central Michigan team had the game tied at 13 going into the half. Northwestern scored the next 17 points but the Chippewas went on a late comeback to make it interesting. There were 20 (twenty!) total penalties in this game combined. That’s MACtion. 25. Northwestern 30 UNLV 14 (2019) UNLV running back Charles Williams gave the ‘Cats a big scare early as he escaped for touchdown runs from 65 and 37 yards out in the first half. Northwestern’s offense was clicking though so it ultimately didn’t matter. The Rebels fumbled twice in Wildcat territory. Hunter Johnson followed the first one up by reaching UNLV territory only to throw an interception. Another sicko play: Paddy Fisher recorded a pick of his own in the third quarter and got stripped from behind on the return before the Wildcats recovered the fumble. 24. Miami (OH) 17 Northwestern 14 (2022) This was prime MACtion after dark. Miami quarterback Aveon Smith who replaced the injured Brett Gabbert for the night was... not great. His line: 7-for-19 62 yards passing and a touchdown. He could have had another had he not missed a wide open receiver streaking down the right sideline on a botched NU coverage. The ‘Cats weren’t much better on offense capping off the night with Malik Washington’s second fumble after he proved to be the only Wildcat player at a skill position to develop much momentum. Northwestern also blocked a Graham Nicholson kick! 23. Northwestern 26 Eastern Michigan 14 (2007) Eastern Michigan threw three interceptions. Every single one was in Northwestern territory and two were in the red zone. Both teams combined for six turnovers. Plus this game was at Ford Field in Detroit as part of EMU’s “Collegiate Clash” which started in 2004. Then the April before the game it got bumped from Saturday to Friday night because of the Detroit Catholic High School League playoffs. Did Ford Field officials make the right choice? Possibly. Eastern Michigan discontinued the Collegiate Clash after 2007. 22. Northwestern 36 Nevada 31 (2007) Northwestern went down 24-10 at the half with the final score of the second quarter coming on a 48-yard touchdown pass from Nevada as the clock ran out. Somehow it wasn’t even a Hail Mary; Kyle Sammons just found himself wide open after Nevada signal-caller Nick Graziano avoided the pass rush. C.J. Bacher had to put together a last-minute touchdown drive to escape with the win against the Wolfpack and the game ended with a safety. 21. Northwestern 31 Nevada 20 (2017)  In the first half Charlie Kuhbander missed a 21-yard field goal and Ben Skowronek fumbled in the red zone. That allowed a Nevada team that would finish the year 3-9 to hold a 20-17 lead over the ‘Cats in the fourth quarter. Clayton Thorson put it away with two late touchdowns but he was also part of a turnover sequence. With the game tied at 17 Nevada threw an INT in the end zone that Kyle Queiro snagged. Just three plays later Thorson threw a pick that the Wolfpack turned into its final field goal of the game. 20. Northwestern 24 Ball State 19 (2015) Jack Mitchell missed a 26-yard field goal in the fourth but that special teams miscue was nowhere near as crazy as the ‘Cats blocking a Ball State PAT attempt. Another crazy sequence came in the second quarter. The Cardinals fumbled at the NU 4 which came on a mishandled snap. Thorson moved the chains once but got picked off on a deep throw. How did Ball State fare on the next possession? A missed field goal. A first-quarter fumble from Thorson might’ve been even funnier. On a run he got stripped and three Ball State players unsuccessfully dove at the ball as it rolled around before someone finally pounced on it. Both teams combined for over 900 yards of offense and somehow only came away with 43 combined points. Tier Three: Now it’s getting disgusting 19. Northwestern 35 Maine 21 (2013) Unless you count Maine’s kneel-down to end the first half as a drive NU ended consecutive possessions with pick-sixes. The first one came off a dropped pass which was the possession after Kain Colter threw an interception that was tipped in the air by receiver Tony Jones. The second pick-six was returned by Dean Lowry for 19 yards and a defensive lineman taking off with the ball is always something cool to see. Maine somehow outgained NU in yardage 379 to 373 in a game that featured five turnovers and kickers going 0-for-3 on field goals. 18. Northwestern 16 Miami (OH) 6 (2009) Miami turned it over four times and didn’t put up points for 58 minutes. The RedHawks blocked a Stefan Demos field goal attempt. Both quarterbacks combined to complete 32 of their 67 passes for a touchdown four interceptions and an average quarterback rating of 25.2. There were 15 punts in this game. This was just disgusting. 17. Northwestern 45 UMass 6 (2019) Forget that this was a blowout. This was the Malört Bowl. Funny things that happened: a freshman Evan Hull erupting for 220 yards and four touchdowns Chris Bergin returning a blocked kick by Joe Gaziano 85 yards to the house Aidan Smith going 7-for-13 with 76 yards and two interceptions (while NU still won the game by 39) and the fact that 29447 people apparently showed up to this game on a 35-degree day in the middle of November.  And there was much much more. 16. Northwestern 21 Miami (OH) 3 (2006) Here are the first 10 drives of this game: Northwestern turns it over on downs at the Miami 25 punt punt punt punt punt punt punt punt kneel. Then on the first possession of the third quarter Miami was set to punt again when NU blocked it. Erryn Cobb took it into the end zone to put up the first points of the game. Joking aside it was also a really nice feel-good moment for the ‘Cats who were playing their first game after Randy Walker passed away. It probably shouldn’t have been this close against a Miami team that would finish 2-10 for its first losing season since 1993. 15. Air Force 52 Northwestern 3 (2002) As expected Air Force didn’t do a ton through the air: Falcons QB Chance Harridge went 5-for-7 with just 47 yards and a touchdown. The ground game though? Different story: 74 carries 471 yards five touchdowns. No one on Air Force accumulated over 100 yards and no one rushed more than 20 times but 16 different Falcons got carries. The only reason this didn’t make the top 10 was because that Air Force team at 8-5 was actually pretty good. 14. Northwestern 14 Eastern Michigan 6 (2006) No player threw for 100 yards! There were 17 total punts! Northwestern won by eight points against a 1-11 team that only surrendered fewer points in 2006 just once! EMU then coached by current Northwestern special teams coordinator Jeff Genyk had its two quarterbacks combine for 9-for-25 passing 47 yards two interceptions and QBRs of 2.6 and 10.7. Mike Kafka wasn’t awful and scored a touchdown on the ground but he also wasn’t leaps and bounds better through the air. Andrew Brewer then a redshirt freshman who would eventually convert to wide receiver was the only gunslinger to have moderate success. Brewer went 6-for-8 as a passer but even he wasn’t immune to the craziness of this game; he lost a fumble. 13. Nevada 31 Northwestern 21 (2006) The 2006 team just found itself in these types of games often and this doesn’t even take into account its blown 38-3 lead against Michigan State that broke a record. Anyway Northwestern started the game off with a nice 10-play 80-yard touchdown drive. Seems like a normal game right? Wrong. The Wildcats turned it over on each of their next three possessions with Tyrell Sutton fumbling and Kafka sandwiching that mistake with two picks. Nevada scored off every giveaway and turned them into 17 points before the first quarter had even ended. NU recorded an INT of its own in the second quarter but Joel Howells missed a 39-yard field goal. The Wolfpack followed that up with a missed kick of their own from 42 yards out on the very next drive. Somehow that still wasn’t enough special teams chaos as Nevada blocked a 32-yard try from Howells in the third quarter. How’d it answer? With a punt of course which went 69 yards to the NU 6. The exclamation point came when Kafka threw an interception with about two minutes to go inside his own 25 which was returned the other way for the game-clinching score. Tier Two: The Outer Pantheon 12. Northwestern 38 Northern Illinois 37 (2005) This game is where I think my subjectivity factors in the most. Was this chaotic and entertaining? Of course maybe more than any other game on this list. But it was pretty exciting it was definitely watchable and it was good football between two teams that would each win seven games that year. The Huskies and ‘Cats eclipsed 1000 yards of total offense combined in a shootout. NIU blocking a 30-yard field goal attempt in the second quarter which came after both teams traded turnovers on the prior two possessions was a sign of things to come. Marquice Cole returned a punt 81 yards to the end zone just six minutes later. While Northwestern held a 24-14 lead going into halftime it was far from over. For the final 27 minutes and change of this contest there were zero punts. Scores came on six of the final seven drives with the one exception being Northern Illinois’ goal-line stand after Wildcat Ryan Pederson couldn’t break the plane on a fourth-and-goal. The end of the game was really what made this stand out though. With 1:15 to go and the game tied at 31 Northwestern faced a third-and-4 in the red zone. A holding penalty set the ‘Cats up at the 5-yard line. NIU only had two timeouts so Randy Walker’s team could just burn some clock to ensure the Huskies wouldn’t have enough time to put together a drive. That didn’t happen as Tyrell Sutton scored on first down. Northern Illinois needed just 51 seconds to march 71 yards into the end zone. Inexplicably Northwestern sent a seven-man blitz on the 11-yard touchdown pass to Sam Hurd. NIU went for two looking to win the game right there but couldn’t connect on a fade. The rushing numbers were outrageous: Sutton and Northern Illinois lead back Garrett Wolfe  combined for 64 carries 459 yards and seven touchdowns. That is prime mid-2000s football. 11. Southern Illinois 31 Northwestern 24 (2022) Just a painful experience for everyone involved. The moment Bryce Gallagher was left on an island with SIU’s tight end on a 57-yard touchdown people had a feeling that the day could take a rough turn. There was a four-minute stretch in the second quarter where three interceptions were thrown. The Salukis snagged the last one in Northwestern territory and had an opportunity for a 32-yard field goal to take a 17-14 lead going into halftime but it was blocked. And that wasn’t even their first missed field goal of the half! The fun wouldn’t stop there as Northwestern fumbled twice in the second half. The first was from Evan Hull who gave the ball away in SIU territory just seven days after his goal-line fumble against Duke. The second came on a strip sack of Ryan Hilinski deep in Northwestern territory essentially giving the Salukis a free red zone trip (which they cashed in). Four turnovers against an FCS opponent is to put it lightly not great. 10. Army 21 Northwestern 14 (2011) This one is just dumbfounding by looking at the box score. Army quarterback Trent Steelman threw one completion on seven attempts for a grand total of six yards. The issue was that the Black Knights ran triple option more than a 10-year old spams Four Verticals on Madden. Army rushed for 381 yards on 75 runs and Steelman scored every touchdown. The kickers missed all three of their field goals — two of which were within 30 yards. Northwestern had a chance to score after recovering a fumble at Army’s 30-yard line only for the offensive line to surrender a five-yard sack of Kain Colter. That drive ended with Pat Fitzgerald taking a delay of game from Army’s 35-yard line to give Brandon Williams room to punt. 9. Northwestern 27 Eastern Michigan 24 (2009) Everything seemed perfectly normal when Northwestern linebacker Ben Johnson returned an interception 70 yards for a touchdown to put the ‘Cats up 21-0 early in the second quarter. Surely there was no way that an Eastern Michigan team that would finish the season 0-12 and go 2-for-10 on third downs that day could comeback. Not against an eight-win NU team that went on to win against No. 17 Wisconsin and at No. 8 Iowa. Anything is possible at Ryan Field. Down 21-3 EMU came out of halftime with an 88-yard touchdown drive that was extended thanks to an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on a third down play. Northwestern knocked a field goal through to bring the lead back to 14 but later muffed a punt. Eastern Michigan put up a touchdown and then picked off Kafka after he had gotten to the edge of the red zone. The Eagles scored tying the game. While Stefan Demos kicked a 49-yarder to bail the ‘Cats out which is crazy enough NU couldn’t even execute that drive normally. NU got to the EMU 25 with about a minute to go seemingly in control to win the game on a short kick. On cue back-to-back holding and offensive pass interference penalties forced Northwestern into a first-and-35 from midfield. Mercifully Kafka got the ‘Cats to the 32-yard line to set up Demos. 8. Hawaii 49 Northwestern 41 (2004) Where to even begin? A good place is the start time. This took place the weekend after Thanksgiving in Honolulu at night. So the ‘Cats kicked off at 11 p.m. CT a week after playing Illinois at 11 a.m. Yet it was the Rainbow Warriors who were sluggish to start as quarterback Timmy Chang threw two interceptions on his first two drives. Northwestern jumped out to a 20-7 lead scoring six of those points when Brett Basanez scooped up and advanced a goal-line fumble from Noah Herron. The tailback appeared to simply drop the ball after running into the line but Basanez delivered. Before Northwestern could even blink though Hawaii put up 21 unanswered points. Chang connected with Chad Owens for 40 and 35-yard scores before halftime to seize control. In the third quarter Owens would come up with a play longer than both of those touchdowns combined as he returned a punt 76 yards to the end zone.  After the teams traded scores NU came up with a big special teams moment of its own. Down 49-33 Northwestern blocked a punt and returned it for a touchdown and converted the two-point try to cut it to a one-score game. When the Rainbow Warriors missed a 33-yard field goal all signs seemed to indicate a Northwestern comeback. Basanez got close but then badly overthrew his receiver on a short pass from the Hawaii 20 for a game-ending interception. There were over 1000 yards of offense Owens scored five total touchdowns and the result knocked the Wildcats out of a bowl appearance that year. 7. Northwestern 16 Ohio 8 (2008) This legendary game featured 10 total turnovers. If that wasn’t enough Northwestern also blocked two field goals for good measure. C.J. Bacher threw four interceptions for a QBR of 8.0 on the day and Ohio ran for just four total yards. Still the Bobcats somehow took six trips inside the Northwestern 25. Here are the results: missed field goal end zone interception blocked kick touchdown blocked kick fumble. Had the last fumble not happened an eventual 9-4 Northwestern team could have faced overtime against a 4-8 team from the bottom of the MAC. Tier One: Bedlam Illinois 6. Air Force 22 Northwestern 21 (2003) Air Force’s leading passer(s) threw for 51 yards and still might have played better than Basanez. A Falcons fumble recovered by Tim McGarigle at midfield with about eight minutes to go and Northwestern up 21-13 seemed to put the ‘Cats in good position to win. Plus Air Force didn’t have its starting QB and option threat Chance Harridge in the game. He was ejected in the third quarter after getting stripped and proceeding to punch a Northwestern player. Chances looked even better when Jason Wright and Ashton Aikens rushed for gains of six and 15. That was when Basanez threw his second interception of the game which was returned for a 79-yard pick six. However Air Force couldn’t convert the two-point conversion giving Northwestern the ball back with the lead and 5:49 to go. Didn’t matter. Basanez threw another INT that set the Falcons up at the NU 11. They kicked a field goal to take the lead giving Northwestern one last real shot to win with two minutes to go. The result? Yet another interception. This Air Force team won seven games which keeps this from being higher on the list but three interceptions on consecutive drives is a sight to behold. 5. Northwestern 49 Navy 40 (2002) At this point Navy had passed and ran for 300 yards in the same game once in the last 54 years. Of course this became No. 2 as the Wildcats surrendered 678 total yards. The Midshipmen embarrassed Northwestern with the option but the ‘Cats also exploded on offense. There were 12 total touchdowns 10 of which came on drives of less than three minutes. That gave Navy enough possessions to turn the ball over five times (fumbling four times) while also putting up 40 points. It held the ball for 21 minutes in the second half. Northwestern linebacker Doug Szymul totaled 26 tackles! Everywhere you look across the box score something weird happened. This was exactly how a game between a Navy team that would go 2-10 and a Wildcats team that went 3-9 should look. Both teams averaged 24 and 22 points respectively but happened to both explode against each other. Northwestern sealed the game with an interception in the end zone as Navy was trying to cut an 11-point game to one score. 4. Bowling Green 43 Northwestern 42 (2001) The Daily Northwestern reported that “the vast majority of the Northwestern community” opted not to attend this late November game which featured “the smallest Ryan Field crowd of the year.” For that to be noticeable among Northwestern students speaks volumes. Well they missed a lot. There were over 1200 yards of offense in this one! The first great sequence in this game came on a set of three drives with Northwestern up 21-7 in the second quarter. NU QB Zak Kustok got tackled on his first play from the Wildcats’ 44-yard line for a loss of eight then threw an interception on the next play. Bowling Green followed it up with a drive that ended at Northwestern’s 14 with a fumble and NU responded with a turnover on downs in no man’s land after reaching Bowling Green territory. But the fun really began in the fourth quarter. An 80-yard touchdown pass and another long TD drive put the ‘Cats up 42-28 with 3:44 to go. If it hasn’t been hammered into everyone by now though nothing is guaranteed. The Falcons marched down the field for a touchdown. Northwestern appeared to have the game wrapped up with a drive into Bowling Green territory and running back Torri Stuckey looked like he had sealed the game as he crossed the 25-yard-line with a game-clinching first down. He fumbled. Bowling Green drove 78 yards in 59 seconds. Urban Meyer who coached the team at the time (as if this couldn’t get any funnier) opted to go for two and the win. Randy Walker apparently didn’t get the memo as he initially sent out his special teams unit on the game’s biggest play. Northwestern of course had used its last timeout earlier because a defensive lineman needed to catch his breath which turned everything into pure chaos. Ten players were on the field and Bowling Green took advantage of a wide open spot where the outside linebacker should have been to walk in for the easy conversion. It was an 8-3 Bowling Green team so it wasn’t the worst opponent to lose to but that’s quite the way to do it. 3. Western Michigan 22 Northwestern 21 (2016) If this picture doesn’t tell you how strange and disturbing this game was I don’t know what does. What in the Chris Collins is this? Western Michigan held possession against a Big Ten team with Justin Jackson for 39 minutes. This was back-and-forth throughout the afternoon with the Broncos taking the lead on a fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line with a little under six minutes to go. Clayton Thorson responded with a drive that set the ‘Cats up at WMU’s 6-yard line. In a matter of minutes ESPN’s win probability had swung from giving Western Michigan a 76.5% chance of winning to the Wildcats sitting at 88%. Any points would do. Anything. Thorson took a snap dropped back and scrambled off tackle toward an open goal line. That’s when Robert Spillane came out of nowhere and forced a fumble. The ball rolled into the end zone headed for the sideline when a Western Michigan player inexplicably tried to scoop up and throw the ball back inbounds which NU appeared to recover for what would have been a touchdown. The officials ruled that the player and/or the ball was out of bounds though which saved Western Michigan. It ran out the clock and won its first game en route to a 13-1 season that earned Fleck the Minnesota coaching job. 2. Akron 39 Northwestern 34 (2018) Northwestern had 29 first downs Akron had 15. NU gained over 100 more yards than Akron. The Zips had 15 penalties and the ‘Cats took a 21-3 lead at the half. Northwestern lost this game. After a field goal and a punt to open the third quarter the second half featured five straight drives that ended in touchdowns. The second one looked like it’d belong to Northwestern but that’s when Thorson threw a 97-yard pick six to Akron’s Alvin Davis which cut NU’s lead to 21-19. The two teams traded a few scores which brought the game to 28-26 in the middle of the fourth quarter. Then two crushing drives wrapped the game up: Akron returned a fumble 19 yards for a go-ahead touchdown only for Thorson to throw another pick six to Davis on the very next possession. Northwestern couldn’t convert a fourth-and-1 from midfield and that basically sealed it. It’s still insane how a team that won the Holiday Bowl the same year managed to lose this game to a 4-8 MAC team. 1.

Share this story Whether it’s football or any other sport at any level coaches seem to adulate the mantra “A win is a win.” Even if a team was outgained by 200 yards or recovered four of its own fumbles the end result is largely what’s underscored of being either a successful or failed result. Intertwined with that philosophy is one that the victorious team has simply determined often “willed” a way to leave on top no matter the circumstances or luck involved. To be honest I’m not a big proponent of a win simply being “a win” neglecting the factors that played a role in determining the outcome. To boil down the result of a 60-minute contest into something that binary ignores necessary context and even the emotions involved. Indeed Saturday’s outcome for Northwestern football reinforced why a win is so much more than just a number added to the left tally of a team’s record. For the first time in 694 days the Wildcats won in America and at Ryan Field. The team ended a 12-game losing streak which many figured could have extended throughout the remainder of 2023. And that victory was earned via a truly overpowering performance with Northwestern throttling the UTEP Miners 38-7. It can be easy to dismiss what transpired in the game as NU simply having more talent and better coaching as a Power Five Big Ten team compared to its Conference USA foe. But even earlier this week the principle of a Wildcat advantage was legitimately doubted by pundits and fans nationwide. In fact oddsmakers wondered whether an upset was in store with the Miners beginning game week as favorites. Northwestern not only answered those questions resoundingly but also finally put together a complete performance that had eluded it for so long. After allowing the Miners to trot 71 yards down the field effortlessly on their first possession the ‘Cats’ defense became actively stingy. The team notched three total interceptions of UTEP quarterbacks including one midway through the third quarter by Bryce Gallagher that set up the Wildcat offense at the 3-yard line. Additionally NU’s defensive line had a significantly better showing than a week ago against Rutgers permitting just three yards per carry and generating four sacks. On top of a defensive shutout pitched after the 11:08 mark of the first quarter Northwestern’s offense — which has looked much maligned for the better part of a full season — began to establish balance and rhythm. The Wildcats aggregated 184 rushing yards on 39 carries punching the ball into the end zone with three different players (including lo and behold two quarterbacks). In the pass game starter Ben Bryant was more accurate and effective than his purple-and-white debut; even when Bryant was forced to leave with an upper body injury NU still made impact plays with the pass as evidenced by Joseph Himon II’s electrifying 85-yard screen house call. Frankly the way Northwestern’s home opener unfolded was a bit of a shock given the Wildcats’ languid play for over a year and a UTEP squad boasting legitimate NFL talent (five pro teams were in attendance). Effectively it’s the first time the Wildcats have looked significantly superior to an opponent in every way since they dismantled Ohio 35-6 on Sept. 25 2021 nearly two years ago. Another facet of NU’s home-opening win that can’t be ignored is that once and for all those in and around the Northwestern football program have something to genuinely feel good and positively about. Following the firing of Pat Fitzgerald and allegations of hazing and racism that rocked the team and institution in the last two months there have scarcely been any headlines praising NU let alone the product the Wildcats have displayed on the field. No matter if one were donning a “’Cats Against the World Shirt” — and there was no shortage of them in Evanston on Saturday — or simply there to watch their favorite team play again everyone can find joy in a win of that caliber in ending an almost improbable stretch that’s still tough to comprehend. The Wildcats’ triumph over UTEP wasn’t typical and not just because of the time elapsed between North American wins. It proved to be a game of firsts: the inaugural touchdowns of youngsters Himon and Jack Lausch the first end zone trips as Wildcats for Bryant and A.J. Henning the initial made field goal of Jack Olsen’s career Anto Saka’s sack Number One. And of course it was David Braun’s first victory as a head coach. Palpable excitement radiated from Braun as he both stepped to and exited the Welsh-Ryan Arena media room podium Saturday evening with a smile almost impossible to conceal forever. High-fives and celebratory yells permeated the arena’s concourses. Even the deflecting Braun — calling it “our win” — recognized what the moment meant to him individually. “Gratitude for the people we’re doing this with” Braun said about his emotions. “Gratitude and a lot of humility for the opportunity. Soaking it all in. I know that I’m ready for this moment but in a lot of ways it still feels surreal.” Despite the optimism emanating from Ryan Field Saturday there are still a multitude of questions that the Wildcats will face throughout the rest of the season. Will Northwestern be able to reach a similar echelon of spotless performance let alone win another game? Can this team make games competitive against marquee opponents with No. 21 Duke Minnesota and No. 7 Penn State on the docket in the next three weeks? What does fan and student support look like over the next two-and-a-half months? As the sunset glowed serenely over Central Street and players exited with families in tow Ryan Field’s scoreboard proudly put forth a graphic it hadn’t in eight games: “Cats Win.” At long last that evasive sense of victory is finally associated with Northwestern football all that matters for the next few days — and unquestionably something unifying all factions of a divided fanbase. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story The dust is starting to settle just a bit around the college football landscape. While some teams are proving that they’re back to contending at the top there’s a much larger contingent of teams that are starting to reveal themselves to be among the middle of the pack once again. This was the big story of the week in the Big Ten where there were sparks of excellence among some teams but many more examples of teams showing their true (and not so pretty) colors. With that being said welcome back to a new edition of Around the Big Ten. Iowa reclaims the Cy-Hawk Trophy Let’s start with the good shall we? Everyone loves a good interconference rivalry game and that’s what was on tap for Iowa and Iowa State this past Saturday as they battled it out for the coveted Cy-Hawk Trophy. In typical Iowa fashion the game was a relatively low -scoring affair as the Hawkeye defense once again carried the team to a 20-13 win over their in-state rivals. While Iowa’s offense was held to just 235 yards defensive back Sebastian Castro came through with a 30-yard pick-six to break the game open to the tune of a 17-0 lead for the Hawkeyes in the quarter. This level of offense isn’t likely to result in a conference title but with a lockdown defense once again at their disposal a Big Ten West title is very much a possibility. In the meanwhile they can enjoy the fact that the Cy-Hawk Trophy is back in their possession and they’re back in the AP Top 25 at No. 25. Purdue bounces back We stay in the Big Ten West for more good news for the conference this week. While the majority of the Big Ten struggled in Power Five matchups this weekend (more on that in a bit) the Boilermakers were able to bounce back from a tough loss at home to Fresno State in Week One to go on the road and beat Virginia Tech by a score of 24-17. Using a late touchdown by quarterback Hudson Card midway through the fourth quarter Purdue was able to escape Blacksburg with a victory and avoid an 0-2 start. Card once again played a solid game as he did last week but for the key for the quick turnaround you have to look at the Purdue defense for this one. The Boilermakers forced two turnovers out of the Hokies and held them to 11 yards on the ground. That’s going to get it done against most teams. Purdue will look to continue the positive momentum this upcoming weekend as a home date with Syracuse awaits. Top teams go on cruise-control Two weeks into the season it seems apparent that the top of the Big Ten is exactly what we expected it to be before the season got underway. It’s Michigan Ohio State Penn State and then everyone else at this point. Each of those teams had home matchups against inferior opponents this past weekend and each of those teams as expected won handily. Michigan beat UNLV 35-7 and Ohio State matched it by beating FCS opponent Youngstown State in identical fashion 35-7. Penn State was also in action against an FCS opponent in Delaware whom they blew out by a score of 63-7.  It’s hard to learn much about top teams in these types of games but there were positives to take away in each. For the Wolverines J.J. McCarthy continued to look sharp. He has a completion percentage of 87.3% through two games and continues to look the part of the conference’s top signal caller. For Ohio State Kyle McCord and Marvin Harrison Jr. looked more in lock-step this week. Harrison Jr. went off with seven catches for 160 yards and a couple of touchdowns for the Buckeyes as their offense looks to get back to their usual level. For the Nittany Lions their ground game was unstoppable on Saturday to the tune of 315 yards and six touchdowns. While it’s impossible to know whether this level of performance by all three teams can continue against quality opponents they’re each doing what they’re supposed to be doing and that’s good enough for right now. Big second halves help to avoid upset losses to Group of Five We’ve raced through the good (and the meh) to this point but now it’s time to talk about the bad. And there were plenty of examples of it across the board in the Big Ten this past Saturday. Multiple teams were scheduled to play Group of Five teams at home games they were expected to win. But someone forgot to tell the teams early on because the Upset Alert was going off for a good chunk of the conference as some of the games reached halftime. Let’s run through some of these halftime scores: To be fair to Northwestern it was only a slight favorite over UTEP going in so that halftime score was far from unexpected. But for teams like Maryland and Minnesota it was a bit concerning to see them struggling so heavily. Entering the season Maryland was picked as a clear fourth in the Big Ten East behind the trio of national contenders and with Taulia Tagovailoa returning at quarterback the expectations were high. Minnesota is a team that many pegged as contenders in the Big Ten West while Eastern Michigan had just the week prior struggled to put away FCS opponent Howard at home.  Ultimately these schools used big second halves to put away their opponents. Northwestern pulled away from the Miners with 31 second-half points for a 38-7 win while Maryland eventually flipped the switch for a 38-20 victory. Minnesota outscored the Eagles 15-0 in the second half to win 25-6 and Rutgers scored 23 unanswered points to secure the win against Temple by a score of 36-7. While the wins are all that matters at the end of the day these teams’ struggles early on raises questions about how competitive they’ll be moving forward. Big Ten West struggles in key Power Five matchups Last but certainly not least we have reached the ugly portion of this Big Ten report. Illinois Wisconsin and Nebraska all had road dates with Power Five opponents this past weekend. That’s not all they had in common though as all three also came out of the weekend with losses on their resumes. Illinois lost to Kansas 34-23 in a game where the final score makes it look closer than it actually was while Nebraska lost to rival Colorado 36-14 where the final score makes it look more like a blowout than it actually was.  And then you have the Badgers who came into this season as the Big Ten West favorites losing a battle in Pullman by a score of 31-22 in Luke Fickell’s debut season at Wisconsin. You have to give props to these schools scheduling games against Power Five opponents as every team in the East was playing Group of Five teams or FCS schools this week. Unfortunately however that doesn’t change the fact that all these schools came out of it with some tough losses.

Share this story After a discouraging loss to open the season against Rutgers the ‘Cats snapped their 12-game losing streak with a 38-7 victory over UTEP. In their first win in over a calendar year the ‘Cats showed plenty of promise as a dominant second-half effort propelled the program to a much-needed victory. Here are five things we learned from Northwestern’s first win under David Braun. Mike Bajakian isn’t scared of being creative In Northwestern’s first contest Bajakian’s play-calling was stale opting to focus on throwing the ball early and often and not allowing the ‘Cats to sustain any offensive momentum when plays went astray. Last year the offense was the Evan Hull show as Bajakian relied heavily on the now-NFL talent to move the chains. However against UTEP Bajakian’s offensive game plan showed that the Wildcats have the ability to be creative and successful in moving the ball downfield. Not only was there better efficiency running the ball but Northwestern’s 207 passing yards and 184 rushing yards against the Miners showcase a team that can beat opponents multiple ways. Finding ways to use the explosive running of sophomore QB Jack Lausch who rushed for Northwestern’s first touchdown against UTEP emphasizes that this offense’s bag of tricks is deep. Plus designing jet sweeps for speedster AJ Henning who also had a rushing touchdown proves that Bajakian can find ways to get the ball into the hands of Northwestern’s playmakers — something crucial to any success the ‘Cats find this season. Although Northwestern wasn’t playing a Power-5 opponent Bajakian’s offensive game plan was promising of what this offense can do moving forward. The QB room’s pecking order isn’t as clear as we thought Coming into the week against UTEP coach Braun made it clear that even after a shaky performance against Rutgers Ben Bryant was the man for the ‘Cats under center. And other than a bad sequence of plays following his four-for-four start Bryant played well completing 11-of-17 passes for 116 yards and a touchdown. The transfer also scored via a QB sneak. But after an upper-body injury Bryant sustained in the second half Northwestern opted to input Ryan Hilinski who calmly closed things out for the ‘Cats even throwing a screen to RB Joseph Himon who scampered 85 yards for another Northwestern touchdown. Northwestern also utilized the legs of Lausch creating specific packages for the sophomore to showcase his running ability. Lausch carried the ball four times for 53 yards and a touchdown adding a dynamic piece to Northwestern’s rushing attack. But in the flurry of QB moves Northwestern chose to use Brendan Sullivan stayed on the sideline making fans wonder about his place among Northwestern’s signal callers. Thought to be the backup to Bryant Hilinski getting game action over Sullivan showed that Sullivan being the clear number two isn’t definite. Plus Northwestern opting to utilize Lausch’s running ability when Sullivan possesses a similar skillset seems strange; however Northwestern fans shouldn’t be upset about giving the younger player opportunities to see the field. Nonetheless amid all the positives from the win Sullivan’s role on this team got a little bit murkier. Bryce Gallagher is going to earn national attention with his play Every time Bryce Gallagher steps on the field he dominates the game. Against Rutgers his career-high 19 tackles was a lone bright spot in a bad game for Northwestern. Against UTEP Gallagher’s impact was a little different. Only amassing five tackles against the Miners Gallagher hauled in his second-career interception reading the eyes of UTEP QB Gavin Hardison and picking off the gunslinger over the middle of the field.  Gallagher’s ability to find the football and make impact plays makes him special. A true leader of this Northwestern defense by example and as a captain Gallagher’s play through two games is worthy of national attention. And as the weather takes a turn for the cold and hard-nosed Big Ten football comes back into the forefront of play Gallagher’s physical style will only be more impactful. If the fifth-year continues to dominate the way he’s dominating right now expect lots of recognition for the heart and soul of Northwestern’s defense at the end of the season. Northwestern’s backfield has the talent to power this offense 22 rushes for 12 yards — that was the stat line against Rutgers. Thanks to the improved play from the offensive line against UTEP the ‘Cats ran wild running the ball 38 times for 184 yards and three scores. Lausch and Henning were big parts of the ground game but Cam Porter’s impact opened everything up for the ‘Cats.  After dealing with injuries earlier in his Northwestern career and being stuck in the shadow of Hull last season Porter showed he’s capable of being a focal point of Northwestern’s offense. The senior starter carried the ball 17 times for 90 yards while also hauling in two passes for 14 yards. Porter’s burst and athleticism were on full display against the Miners as the Ohio native spun away from defenders. Porter’s success also opened up the offense as his six and seven yard runs allowed the ‘Cats to use the play-action passing game. Don’t forget Joseph Himon either. The sophomore from Arkansas only carried the ball four times for six yards but his one catch in the second half ended up an 85-yard touchdown — the cherry on top of a fantastic second-half performance. Himon’s speed and vision in the open field were on display as the Arkansas native raced away from defenders putting the game even further out of reach. If it’s Porter or Himon the win showed Northwestern has capable options out of the backfield as runners and pass-catchers. The defensive line showed that its performance against Rutgers isn’t the norm The defensive line had a brutal day against Rutgers in Week One: zero sacks no pressure and a tough day stopping the run. But after a week to retool the ‘Cats’ defensive front came back with an improved performance against the Miners. Northwestern finished the game with four sacks but the biggest difference was the ability to pressure UTEP and get off the field holding the Miners to 3-of-13 efficiency on third downs. Although Northwestern dialed up different looks to get pressure Aidan Hubbard Anto Saka and Sean McLaughlin stood out as playmakers up front. Hubbard and Saka who continues to flash in his opportunities as a sophomore both tallied sacks while McLaughlin’s effort throughout played a huge difference — even getting his hands on an errant pass and batting the ball down at the line of scrimmage for an incompletion. Perhaps more impressive was Northwestern’s ability to hamper UTEP’s dominant rushing attack. Although the Miners mustered 104 rushing yards Northwestern did a good job getting into the backfield and disrupting plays keeping the Miners in check after rushing for 329 yards against Incarnate Word a week before. Although it was far from a perfect performance the defensive line played an improved brand of aggressive and physical football allowing the ‘Cats to get off the field and transfer momentum to the offense especially in the second half. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Ever since the season opener against Louisville Northwestern field hockey has taken its show on the road. After a stop in College Park Md. for the Big Ten/ACC Challenge the Wildcats headed to Vermont a few days later. Then this weekend they traveled all the way up to Maine for a two-step against Maine and UMass. ""And my goodness the Wildcats proved to be quite adept in their dancing shoes. When the dust cleared the team was returning to Evanston with a 2-0 weekend and a +6 scoring margin. The defense hasnt allowed a single goal since Sept. 3 and the offense has scored multiple goals in every game since their overtime victory on Sept. 1."" Whether or not a wildcat could beat a black bear in a fight is potentially an interesting argument. Whether or not the Northwestern Wildcats could beat the Maine Black Bears in field hockey was decided quickly. Northwestern opened the game hot outshooting Maine 5-0 in the first quarter and 8-1 in the second. By the time the game finally wrapped up the shot margin stood at an astounding 26-5 with 18 and two coming on goal. The Wildcats also routinely threatened the Maine goal from set plays garnering 11 penalty corners to the Black Bears’ four. Despite the offensive domination it took a while for Northwestern to get on the scoreboard. Maine goalkeeper Mallory Drayer put on an exhibition saving 15 shots over the course of the game. Six of those saves came in the first 25 minutes locking the game in a scoreless tie. However after the sixth save Drayer was left out of position and the Wildcats quickly took advantage. First-year Ilse Tromp took the loose ball and fired it into the back of the net for the first goal of her Northwestern career. Tromp’s goal lifted the lid and Northwestern took advantage in the second half. After three more saves by Drayer in the third quarter Lane Herbert who had four goals last season beat Drayer with a grounder of a shot to double the lead. About 20 minutes later with time winding down in the game Olivia Bent-Cole sliced through the Maine defense with ease forced Drayer to commit and fired a shot right past her for the final goal of the game. It was the first year’s second score of the season and it moved her into second on the team in goals a spot she currently shares with sophomore Maja Zivojnovic.  The game was also the 200th win for head coach Tracey Fuchs. Fuchs was a three-time All-American and won the 1987 national championship while at UConn and went on to play in 268 international matches more than any other player in American field hockey history. After 12 years as an assistant at Michigan (a run that saw six NCAA tournaments three Big Ten titles and the 2001 national championship) Fuchs was hired to lead Northwestern in 2009. The turnaround was immediate. In her debut season Fuchs led the ‘Cats to their first winning record since 1995 snapping a 14-year drought. After two more winning seasons Fuchs led the 2012 squad to a 16-4 record the most successful season for the program since 1989. The next year the Wildcats won the Big Ten for the first time since 1994. Over the next few years Northwestern remained competitive making the NCAA tournament in 2014 and 2017.  After making the 2019 and 2020 tournaments Northwestern finally broke through in 2021. Led by Bente Baekers and Maddie Zimmer the Wildcats allowed just one goal over the entire NCAA tournament en route to the program’s first national title. Last season the team returned to the NCAA title game only to fall to North Carolina and field hockey phenom (and current Tar Heel head coach) Erin Matson. Fuchs reached 200 wins in her 300th game at the school moving her all-time record to 200-100. She has suffered just one losing season while at the school and that was a 9-10 campaign in 2018. She has also made seven NCAA tournaments tying the legendary Nancy Stevens for most appearances by a Northwestern head coach. The only question: after a 3-0 win for number 200 what would Fuchs do for victory 201? As it turned out another 3-0 win would do nicely. The Wildcats extended their shutout streak to 15 quarters and the victory over UMass marked the team’s fourth shutout in their last five games. The Wildcats once again dominated offensively outshooting the Minutewomen 19-5. The penalty corner battle was a lot closer but Northwestern was able to convert one of their six while UMass was stonewalled in their five attempts. The Wildcats once again opened the scoring in the second quarter after earning a penalty with less than a minute to play in the first half. Team captain Peyton Halsey went left and easily converted for her third goal of the year. Less than three game minutes later Northwestern would double the lead behind Zivojnovic who converted a penalty corner. And for the cherry on top in the fourth quarter Halsey got another penalty stroke. This time she went right and the Wildcats departed Maine with their second consecutive 3-0 victory. Since the season-opening loss to Louisville Northwestern has been on a tear. The Wildcats have outscored their five opponents by a score of 12-2 and the only team they’ve allowed any goals to is current No. 20 Duke. The offense has been led by some new faces too providing lots of hope for the seasons after this one. After graduate student Halsey the top five in scoring include first years Bent-Cole and Tromp as well as Zivojnovic a sophomore. Annabel Skubisz and the defense have also been brilliant. Skubisz has already earned four shutouts this year and her career high for a season is five. Her save percentage of 86.4% is also by far a career-best bettering last year’s mark by nearly 10 percentage points. Her goals allowed mark currently sits at 0.49 a career low by a mile and a top-five mark in the country.  This Wildcats squad is a team built on ferocity on both offense and defense. There is a reason Northwestern currently has 108 shots on the year while all Northwestern opponents have combined for 40. The squad will have a chance to continue showcasing that ability to dominate at home this week. Big Ten play opens against Indiana on Friday and then the Wildcats will welcome Penn to Lakeside Field on Sunday. If everything breaks right Fuchs will head into the last full week of September with her 203rd win.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After Northwestern (1-1 0-1 B1G) secured its first win of David Braun’s tenure against UTEP the ‘Cats will travel to Durham to face Duke (2-0 1-0 ACC) on Saturday. Thanks to an Evan Hull fumble at the goal line in the dying seconds of Northwestern’s 31-23 loss against Duke last season NU will look for its first win against the Blue Devils since 2016. The last time the ‘Cats won at Duke was the year prior — in 2015. Let’s dive into three matchups that’ll dictate the Saturday afternoon game. Duke QB Riley Leonard vs. Northwestern’s pass rush In Week One against Rutgers Northwestern’s pass rush was nonexistent allowing QB Gavin Wimsatt — a question mark heading into the year for the Scarlet Knights — to find success from the pocket. Although UTEP QB Gavin Hardison threw for more yards last week than Wimsatt did in Northwestern’s opener the pressure got to Hardison who threw two interceptions. Northwestern’s pass rush improved drastically going from no sacks against Rutgers to four against the Miners. Against the Blue Devils pressure is paramount to disturbing Duke’s standout QB Riley Leonard. In Duke’s huge win over No. 9 Clemson Leonard went 17-of-33 for 175 yards but more impressively dominated on the ground adding 98 rushing yards and a touchdown. During last week’s blowout win against Lafayette Leonard finished a perfect 12-of-12 for 136 yards a touchdown and 13 yards on the ground. A gifted athlete with his ability to run and throw the football the ‘Cats need to win at the line of scrimmage pressuring Leonard into errors and making things easier for Northwestern’s secondary on the back end. With a comfortable Leonard only meaning trouble for Northwestern the ‘Cats need another big performance from Anto Saka and Sean McLaughlin two standouts from a week ago. The pair will need to pursue the football and help the ‘Cats get off the field on third downs. Duke’s Jordan Waters vs. Northwestern’s Cam Porter With both teams finding success on the ground in their wins last weekend the battle of the running backs could determine which squad comes out on top. Through two weeks the Blue Devils have used a couple different backs in their balanced rushing attack but graduate student Jordan Waters has emerged as Duke’s best option in the ground game. With 11 carries for 112 yards and two scores against Lafayette Waters utilizes his size and physicality between the tackles but he also has the vision and speed to hit the hole and get to the outside. A capable complement to Leonard’s legs Northwestern will need to get into Duke’s backfield if it wants to keep Waters off the scoresheet. Building off a 17-carry 90-yard performance against UTEP Cam Porter is ready to be Northwestern’s next potent running back. The senior looks agile with good burst at the line of scrimmage and underrated elusiveness. After the ‘Cats’ rush-heavy emphasis worked well against the Miners don’t be surprised to see Mike Bajakian lean on Porter’s legs early and often taking some of the pressure off of the passing game. Whether its Waters or Porter the run game will be a big storyline Saturday in Durham. Duke’s Jeremiah Lewis vs. Northwestern’s offensive attack If the name Jeremiah Lewis rings a bell it’s because he played for Northwestern last year. Starting 12 games for the ‘Cats a season ago Lewis finished the year with 70 tackles four pass deflections and 3 tackles for loss from his home at safety. Now back at Duke where he played prior to joining the ‘Cats in 2022 Lewis has performed well. He earned ACC Defensive Back of the Week honors for his performance against Clemson mustering 11 tackles a pass breakup and a fumble recovery — all while playing with a broken thumb. With Lewis not playing in Duke’s last game against Lafayette it’ll be interesting to see if he’s back on the field against the ‘Cats but if he is he’d likely have an impact thanks to his familiarity with Northwestern’s offense. Although the offense looks a little different with transfers Ben Bryant A.J. Henning and Cam Johnson now taking heavy snaps it has a lot of similarities from 2022 with Mike Bajakian still calling plays. If Lewis is good to go on Saturday his familiarity with Bajakian’s play calling tendencies from a season’s worth of practices could certainly impact the game. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Big Ten play begins on Sunday in West Lafayette where the Purdue Boilermakers will be awaiting the ferocious Wildcat offense. When the two faced off last year Northwestern took care of business winning 3-0 behind goals from Hase Boade and Josie Aulicino. Kickoff for this year’s matchup is set for 12 p.m. CT on B1G+. After riding a train back to Evanston the Wildcats will gear up to take on their forest rivals the Wolverines. The Sep. 21 game will get underway at 7 p.m. CT and Michigan will be out for revenge. The ‘Cats won last season’s matchup 3-0 thanks to scores from Regazzoni del Carmen and Hase.

Share this story After notching his first victory at the helm of NUFB interim head coach David Braun met with the media on Monday afternoon before the ‘Cats travel to Durham this weekend. Here is what Braun had to say. Opening statement:  “Exciting Saturday for the team. Very excited to be back in the routine. Guys had yesterday off which was a much-needed off day coming off of a short week but back in the facility today. A couple of corrections from UTEP and we’re moving on to Duke. Duke is a really really well-coached football team that is playing really good football right now. Playing with a lot of confidence. Play great defense balanced football on the offensive side of the ball with high-end quarterback play. So we have a we have a big challenge ahead of us a challenge that we’re excited about. Our guys have done a great job of enjoying Saturday on Saturday and are back in the facility today with full focus on getting down to Durham and playing our best football.” On the reaction to winning on Saturday at Ryan Field: “It was humbling. I think the thing that blew me away most was the continued support from the parents of our players people within the greater Northwestern community alumni other head coaches and just those that have been alongside us every step of the way.  “To have the opportunity to do it so close to home Kristen and I had a lot of family in town for the game and a bunch of guys that I played college football with at Winona State are Chicagoland guys that were at the game. It was neat to share in that.” On the injuries of Ben Bryant and Brendan Sullivan:  “We’re not going to share any specifics but we anticipate at this time both those guys being available.” On Josh Thompson replacing Zach Franks at right tackle: “From day one we’ve said that that position was going to be by committee between those two young men. They were going to rotate in. With game one of Rutgers lacking opportunity for the offense in terms of their amount of snaps on the field in the first half they probably didn’t get into the rotation that Coach Anderson had hoped. But in the second half Josh came in we were hot and stayed with the hot hand. We’ll continue to have both those guys rotate in but I certainly was very impressed with the way that Josh came in in the second half and moved the line of scrimmage. He did some really good things for us.” On concern of lack of continuity on the offensive line: “I think the best lines that I’ve been around do have a sense of rhythm and continuity for sure but especially early in the season have the ability to rotate seven to eight guys in at times to build continuity. Understanding that you got to find some guys that can be position flexible and be swing guys for you allows you to get your best five on the field. You start to really identify that as the season goes along. Also understanding of the physicality that is involved in the position hoping that you stay fully healthy at that position throughout the year but also understanding that’s not always the case and building depth and confidence by being able to play more than just five.” On utilizing different quarterbacks: “Ben Bryant is our starting quarterback and we plan for that to continue to be the case. Utilizing Jack Lausch who’s a quarterback clearly shows he has the ability to throw as well but we’re finding ways to get Jack involved just with his athleticism and his playmaking ability. To speak on the multiple quarterbacks I don’t want to go on without mentioning Ryan His ability to come in with poise operate the offense and show up with just a ton of passion and energy speaks to the quality character of men in that room. They’re selfless coach one another carry one another. For Ryan to come in step in and do what he did and to do it with the energy that he did was a reflection of that room and him specifically in terms of his character and his commitment to this team.” On Duke’s relationship with NU:  “There’s a lot of crossover. There are multiple guys that are on Duke’s staff that spent time here at Northwestern and have relationships with guys on our staff. They understand the way that we see the game of football and coach the game of football so there’s a little bit of a chess match going on in that regard. But what I can tell you is there’s just a tremendous amount of respect for the way that that program has operated over the course of the last decade. During Coach Cutcliffe’s [tenure] and with the new staff what they’ve been able to do last year and into this year it’s impressive.  “They’ve built a good foundation there. They’re climbing right now. They’re playing at a really high level in all three phases. We understand we’re not only dealing with a talented team but we’re dealing with a very well-coached team.” On balancing emotions: “Staying completely focused on our process and our passion. Again like I said last week I think this group is at its best as an underdog. We’re not paying attention to lines. You know that’s the first I heard of it but I welcome that information. We talked about how this year is not going to be linear there are going to be ups and downs. “After Rutgers it was certainly a huge letdown. There was certainly an emotional high from Saturday We need to return to our process make sure that we show up with a great deal of passion and energy and put our best foot forward. We’ve known this all the while but Saturday was a great reminder that we have a good football team. We have the right collection of young men of high character that love playing for one another. Anytime that you show up with that type of focus and that type of passion you’re gonna give yourselves selves a chance. We’re going to talk about Duke and how they attack us and understand our opponent but we’re gonna put all our energy into just making sure we show up at our best.” On getting A.J. Henning more involved: “It was critical. Credit to Coach Bajakian and the offensive staff for finding ways to get get the ball in his hands. I think A.J. poses issues for a lot of reasons. When we’re in fall camp and we were not going off the script we’re truly calling offense and defense It’s something that I certainly had to be aware of what calls we were going to be in with A.J. on the field. “I think it’s his versatility that makes him so difficult to defend His ability to line up in the backfield his ability to receive the ball In fly sweeps and jet motions his ability to line up at slot receiver you just don’t know where he’s going to line up and where he’s going to end up. I’m excited to see how our offensive staff continues to find ways to utilize him. We’re excited to get them going in the special teams game as well.” On starting faster defensively: “That’s a great question. If you have any suggestions for me I’m open to them.  “What you’ve seen out of our group is poise and an ability to settle in. I think you see a group that is very hungry and almost is walking into games with this expectation of being perfect. And we all know that the game isn’t played that way. You strive for perfection but it’s fleeting. You’re never going to find that. I think it comes down to this group collectively all eleven on the field maturing from a standpoint of not trying to make every play but just doing our job and being very disciplined with where our eyes need to be. Some of the issues that we’ve seen are our guys that are putting their eyes where they don’t belong because they want to be involved in everything. We just need to focus on doing our job and being disciplined with our eyes.” On Jack Lausch’s role: “The details and specifics I’ll leave that to the offensive staff. What I can tell you is that there’s been consistent conversations from myself to the rest of our staff that he’s a young man that needs to be on the field. He just does. “As you saw he’s got the ability to do some things that can really change the math for defense. It is pretty neat to see a young man of his age his youth a Southside Chicago guy. If you were around for winter workouts you would point to that young man and say ‘Man that guy embodies what this program is all about from a toughness resiliency and natural leadership standpoint.’ [Lausch] is still developing as a quarterback but very talented and continuing to grow. Jack knows how much I believe in him how much our team believes in him and we need to continue to find ways to utilize him.” On watching Northwestern’s past games against Duke and Duke QB Riley Leonard: “It’s just collecting information. Our defensive structure is different now than it was in past years specifically last year but there’s there’s enough similarities in terms of four-down structure. “My gosh I mean to Riley’s credit he just continues to get better and better. You watch the film on him last year and you go this is a good quarterback. You watch the film now and you go oh my gosh. I joked around with the defensive staff earlier today that if you had a cloning machine for what you wanted in a college starting quarterback he’s pretty close.  “In terms of his ability to process the game be efficient in the passing game extend plays with his feet push the ball downfield and be utilized in the quarterback run game he’s done a tremendous job. That coaching staff has done a tremendous job. That entire offense as a whole. it’s not just [Leonard] he’s got plenty of weapons around him. [The Blue Devils] are very well-coached. The offensive line is very talented and that group poses all sorts of issues.” On Bryce Kirtz: “He has the ability to open some things up in terms of his ability to be a slot guy that can really push the ball down the field. His veteran leadership naturally brings on confidence not only from himself but from others.  “Being out of practice and being around Bryce for as long as I have since I arrived in spring when he’s on and in his rhythm which is frequently he not only makes our team better but he makes that group better. He makes everyone else around him play at a higher level. On Jeremiah Lewis:  “Very good player very mature smart driven. We were disappointed to see him go. At the same time during the time that he made that decision there’s no hard feelings. He made a decision based on a time of uncertainty. “Again that all comes back to the 103 that chose to stay. They chose to stay. They chose to stay because of their love and admiration for one another. Credit to those guys but no hard feelings toward him for leaving. He was a good player and certainly a tremendous amount of respect for the way he plays the game.” On which position group most impressed him against UTEP: “We have a lot to work on and a lot to clean up. Overall I was so impressed again with the energy effort and passion that was just coming out of our guys. I mean that is the expectation every single week regardless of the result. That is the expectation every single week.  “After going back and watching the film in all three phases I was really proud of the way that the offensive line moved the line of scrimmage in the second half and I’ll involve the tight ends in that. The way that they moved the line of scrimmage in the second half and then there were some downfield effort plays out of our tight end group. Specifically Marshall Lang you know got voted our Offensive Player of the Week. Go back and check the stats everyone: he didn’t record a stat but was voted offensive player of the game just by the way he played and the effort that he played with.  “That Joe Himon touchdown — that’s Marshall Lang straining to finish a block that springs that thing from a big gain into a touchdown. So to answer your question directly very impressed with the growth in that offense line room specifically in the run game and I’m very impressed with the way that our tight ends continue to stress defenses with their ability to be multiple and the effort that those guys were playing with right now.” On the secondary and pass rush improvement: “Everyone will get sick of me using the two words complimentary football but I’ll continue to because we believe in it. And those two things are complementary. It’s no coincidence that both of those showed up they tend to show up together. More pressure on the quarterback more opportunities to attack the ball in the air with quarterbacks making ill-advised decisions. Good coverage stressed out quarterback that holds on to the football more opportunities for sacks.  “A reflection of no sacks is not just a reflection of the line play and a lack of interceptions or opportunities to make plays on the ball isn’t just a lack of back half play. They’re playing together and that will need to continue for us to have the success that we’re looking for.”  On Xander Mueller’s interception and the forced turnovers: “It was a lot of ‘great job why didn’t you score a touchdown?’ He and [Bryce Gallagher] made some big time plays. Then Joey DeHaan talk about a guy owning his role. He had been the scout team defensive player of the week after Rutgers and gets his opportunity owns his role not satisfied with it owns his role gets an opportunity to get on the field and makes a big-time pick there in the fourth quarter. Tinley Park Southside Chicago kid totally bought in I’m so excited for him. He’s getting better and it was fun to see.” On the Punter situation: “Both young men will continue to develop. Both are weapons and both have a great skill set. They’re just very different skill sets. In terms of Hunter’s comfort level of moving the pocket on punts been able to do some different things there. He does a great job with his operation time which is obviously very critical. Anytime you have your punt unit going out there you certainly want to flip the field but you also want to ensure that the protection is at the forefront of your mind.  “[Luke Akers] is an absolute weapon. When he gets into one I mean talk about flipping the field. The young man can absolutely boom it so we’ll continue to evaluate how to maximize that specialist group. Both are doing some really good things right now.” On his post-game dance moves: “There’s a very firm understanding with those that know me and Kristin probably would reference back to our wedding. The first understanding is I lack rhythm. The second understanding is I’m a high effort guy. So I’ll get on the dance floor and I’ll be moving. I’ll be having a good time. Just don’t expect any rhythm to be along with it.” On staying with the run game when trailing: “Complimentary football. It takes all of us. It’s getting stops on defense. It’s staying committed to it. On the offensive side of the ball celebrating three-yard gains four-yard gains celebrating moving the line of scrimmage. Maybe a one-yard gain but trusting it coming back to it and understanding that it’s going to open up more opportunities as the game goes.  “Again we just need something to celebrate. It snow balled in the second half for us in a positive way. The dominoes started to fall but that was a result of taking the ball away on defense protecting the ball on offense and being efficient on third and fourth down. A couple of three-and-outs a couple of takeaways and all of a sudden our offense really starts to take off.  “That’s how we win here. It’s not going to be flashy it’s going to take four quarters but it’s going to be staying true to our process and our identity as a team. It’s going to require that all three phases hold up their end of the bargain so that the offense can feel like they’re on schedule. The game is not something where we have to chase a score and we can just stay true to our process.”     \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story The NFL kicked off the 2023 season on Sept. 7 when the Detroit Lions shocked the Kansas City Chiefs. As the weekend slate of games progressed many former ‘Cats found a way to contribute for their respective teams.  Every week Inside NU will look at how some Northwestern alumni are faring in the big leagues. With that being said let’s take a look at some of the most notable players who once donned the purple-and-white. Rashawn Slater: Los Angeles Chargers OT The Chargers didn’t have quite enough firepower to keep up with the Miami Dolphins in a close loss but Slater did his part to keep Justin Herbert upright in the pocket. The 13th overall pick in 2021 played the third-most snaps in the league with 80 and didn’t give up a sack or record a penalty. Coming off of a season-ending biceps tendon injury last year Slater looked energized and utterly dominant. He will look to notch his second Pro Bowl and All-Pro nods as the Chargers fight for the AFC West title. Week two matchup: at Tennessee Titans (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Peter Skoronski: Tennessee Titans OG It’s not easy for a rookie offensive lineman to stand out immediately but Skoronski did exactly that in his first NFL game. Skoronski finished as the Titans’ highest-graded player on offense according to Pro Football Focus. Tennessee may have left New Orleans with a loss but the rookie showcased the power and technique that warranted a top-15 selection in the 2023 NFL Draft. Week two matchup: vs. Los Angeles Chargers (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Greg Newsome II: Cleveland Browns CB Newsome II played a vital role for Cleveland’s defense who absolutely smothered Joe Burrow and the Bengals in a dominant win. The third-year cornerback recorded five total tackles which was the second-most behind safety Grant Delpit. Newsome also recorded a pass deflection batting down one of Burrow’s attempts in the rainy weather. He will look to intercept his first career pass this season and form a fearsome tandem with Denzel Ward. Week two matchup: at Pittsburgh Steelers (Monday 7:15 p.m. CT) Dean Lowry: Minnesota Vikings DE Lowry failed to make his mark on the Vikings’ pass rush during their loss to the Buccaneers. He recorded four total tackles but did not pressure the quarterback. Drafted in the fourth round by the Packers in 2016 this is Lowry’s first season in Minnesota. The eight-year veteran has a tough task next week against Philadelphia’s offensive line. Week two matchup: at Philadelphia Eagles (Thursday 7:15 p.m. CT) Evan Hull: Indianapolis Colts RB Hull entered the NFL season with an immediate chance to contribute as star back Jonathan Taylor landed on the Physically Unable to Perform List with an ankle injury. Unfortunately Hull suffered a knee injury during the Week 1 loss to the Jaguars and will be out for multiple weeks. Before exiting the game the rookie recorded one rush for one yard and one reception for six yards.  Week two matchup: at Houston Texans (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Ben Skowronek: Los Angeles Rams WR Skowronek failed to catch a pass in the Rams’ victory against the Seahawks marking a disappointing start to his 2023 season. Though he was targeted twice he took a back seat to young receivers like Tutu Atwell and Puka Nacua. Skowronek made his biggest impact on special teams when he recorded a tackle. The 2021 seventh-round selection was used all over the field last year but the emergence of the receivers around him could severely limit his touches. Week two matchup: vs. San Francisco 49ers (Sunday 3:05 p.m. CT) Cameron Mitchell: Cleveland Browns CB Mitchell got involved on special teams seeing the field for 23 snaps and recording a solo tackle. The fifth-round rookie is currently buried in the depth chart so it’s encouraging to see him make an impact in any way he can. Mitchell will look to keep making plays on special teams and stay ready to step in if a starter gets injured. Week two matchup: at Pittsburgh Steelers (Monday 7:15 p.m. CT) Earnest Brown IV: Los Angeles Rams DE Brown IV recorded just one tackle in the Rams’ victory over the Seahawks bringing running back Kenneth Walker III to the ground in the second quarter. Drafted in the fifth round in 2021 Brown has bounced back-and-forth between Los Angeles’ active roster and practice squad. He is currently listed as the second-string left defensive end so Brown will try to make the most of his limited snaps. Week two matchup: vs. San Francisco 49ers (Sunday 3:05 p.m. CT) Anthony Walker Jr.: Cleveland Browns LB Walker Jr. had a quiet day on the field during Cleveland’s win against the Bengals assisting on one tackle in the fourth quarter; however his performance does not reflect his impact on the Browns’ defensive unit. Walker is their starting middle linebacker and one of Cleveland’s five team captains. The 2017 fifth-round pick is coming off of a torn quad tendon suffered last September and will aim to lead his teammates by example.  Week two matchup: at Pittsburgh Steelers (Monday 7:15 p.m. CT) ‘Cats that didn’t play this week (or record any stats): Adetomiwa Adebawore (Indianapolis Colts) Blake Hance (Jacksonville Jaguars) Tyler Lancaster (Denver Broncos practice squad) Ifeadi Odenigbo (New York Jets) \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now it’s time to prove it won’t happen again. Share this story With the monkey off its back… A murky quarterback situation… Hoping to build momentum in continental contests — all of these things describe where Northwestern football sits on this Week Three Wednesday. Quite the trio of plotlines isn’t it? Six hundred ninety three days stood between the ‘Cats’ Saturday win against UTEP and their last victory on American soil: on Oct. 16 2021. You would’ve thought that at the very least Northwestern had secured a bowl game appearance the way players and coaches described their shared ecstasy for finally notching a home win. Now the stopwatch resets to zero and the program has been liberated from the manacles of Twitter (now known as X) trolls and embarrassing television graphics. NU entered its Week Two matchup against the Miners with plenty on the line. Aside from the obvious desire to smash the storied losing spell the ‘Cats were focusing more granularly — aiming to right the ship after a season opener in which their top passer had a 0-to-2 interception-to-touchdown ratio and the team was run out of the building by a less than impressive Rutgers team. Intent on snatching the program’s first win on the continent in 23 months David Braun and Co. made it known in the days leading up to the game that UTEP was going to get the ‘Cats’ best. The team’s lofty plan was off to a rocky start given that a methodical three–minute 52-second opening drive from the Miners ended in a touchdown pass from quarterback Gavin Hardison. What’s new? Not to worry. Something truly was new in the UTEP game. Northwestern’s defense regrouped and tightened the screws. After a Northwestern touchdown courtesy of Jack Lausch (more on him later) evened the game NU’s defense wired in. The unit forced punts on the Miners’ next two drives before captain Bryce Gallagher corralled an interception midway through the second quarter. Tied at seven a piece going into halftime offensive coordinator Mike Bajakian dialed the gameplan up a notch in the third quarter — resolute that this was the team’s chance to reclaim Ryan Field. An onslaught of 21 points ensued. A near seven-minute drive to open the period ended in an 18-yard Ben Bryant touchdown pass to Thomas Gordon. Two plays into the Miners’ next possession Hardison errantly threw another interception to Xander Mueller who returned the pick to the UTEP three yard line. Ben Bryant capitalized again that time on a QB sneak. From there then 21-7 the game got out of hand. Northwestern scored on each of its remaining drives and UTEP achieved the opposite feat. The ‘Cats sealed a win — yes a win — 38-7. Rejoicing was the natural next step. Before Braun even made it to midfield to shake Miners’ head coach Dana Dimel’s hand he was fist-pumping and mobbed by shoulder pats from his players. The post-game presser featuring Lausch Cam Porter Anto Saka and Mueller boasted a similarly jubilant atmosphere. The win is of course not redemption for nearly 700 days of losing football (void an outlying trip to Ireland). And of course UTEP is far from the type of Power Five school that the ‘Cats aspire to beat. However the team played the opponent in front of them and took care of business which has been far from assured in recent history. The defense looked phenomenal demonstrating its resilience after giving up a touchdown on the game’s opening drive. The veteran pair of linebackers in Gallagher and Mueller never flinched and led their unit with conviction. Young guys including sophomores Anto Saka and Kenny Soares Jr. contributed when it mattered. And Braun pitched a successful outing as the team’s defensive play caller. On the offensive side of the ball the men in purple never left a doubt. Bryant steamrolled his unit’s way to the endzone to offer a direct answer to the Miners’ first-quarter touchdown. From there the offense never let its foot off the pedal. Between a respectable 55% third-down conversion rate and a clean turnover sheet the victory marks the first time in a long time that the ‘Cats have had such a cohesive performance on that side of the ball. These laurels aren’t without their caveats. The focus now turns to maintaining momentum. One win every 365 days isn’t exactly the goal. With a contest against No. 21 Duke awaiting the ‘Cats the high of an emotionally charged win can’t impede diligence. All odds are still stacked against NU and the probability of making the leap from winless in America over the last two years to beating a top-25 team in the nation is slim. But avoiding a curb stomping and proving that there are traits that can be built off of is still a worthwhile objective for Northwestern.  Then arrives the next stipulation. What’s going on at quarterback? Yes Ben Bryant is the starter but after going down with an injury in the later part of the UTEP game it remains to be seen who will be under center on Saturday. Braun has said he thinks Bryant will be ready to go against Duke but will there be a timeshare at quarterback to mitigate injury aggravation? Will Jack Lausch who has been a Swiss army knife for the offense through two games get real reps at the helm of the offense? If Bryant can’t go will Braun and Bajakian opt for Ryan Hilinski like they did against the Miners — even though Brendan Sullivan was the proclaimed backup a few weeks ago (to be fair Sullivan looks to be dealing with a minor injury that Braun hasn’t fully disclosed)? All this is up in the air and leaves pundits and fans alike wanting answers. Only Saturday will tell. NU will be facing off against an elite quarterback and a stout defense; a win is far from expected.  What awaits in Durham is the opportunity for the ‘Cats to prove this is a new era — a new era under Braun a new era under the transfers a new era under the young players who are finally seeing the field. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After a brutal loss in Milwaukee Northwestern shipped up to Boston to compete in the Northeastern Invitational. After two games in Boston NU traveled south to Fairfield Connecticut to take on the Stags. The Wildcats cruised through their weekend matchups sweeping all nine sets. With the ‘Cats returning back to Evanston for a five-game homestand here is a look back at what happened in Northwestern’s trip to New England. Game One vs. Northern Colorado ""In the Wildcats first matchup of the invitational NU jumped out to an early lead against the Bears with back-to-back kills by Julia Sangiacomo stretching the ‘Cats’ advantage to 10-6 in the first set. However Northern Colorado went on a 7-3 run to cut its deficit to 21-19. Despite the Bears’ best effort the Wildcats rattled off four straight points to take the opening set 25-19."" In the second set Northwestern found itself trailing 8-5 early in the frame but a 6-2 run put the ‘Cats ahead 11-10. From there on it was all NU in the middle set with the Wildcats pushing their lead to 16-11 after five straight points. The Bears tried to muster a comeback but a 4-0 run by the Wildcats put the set out of reach and NU secured the middle set 25-17. In the final set of the match Northwestern once again found itself trailing Northern Colorado early falling behind 7-5. However another 5-1 run by NU put the ‘Cats ahead for good and they never looked back. The Wildcats expanded their lead to 17-11 but the Bears made a late push bringing the game to within to at 19-17.  However Northwestern would put the game away scoring four straight points to clinch a 25-19 set victory and 3-0 match win. Sangiacomo led NU with 10 kills and Alexa Rousseau added another 31 assists. On the defensive side Kennedy Hill led the ‘Cats with four blocks. As a team NU had a .395 hitting percentage. Game Two at Northeastern  In a battle of the NUs it was the Wildcats who were the superior squad.  In the first set both teams traded blows. Midway through the set the ‘Cats only led 11-9 but they pulled away. Northwestern scored six straight points to extend its lead to 24-14 and a kill by Ellie Husemann gave the Wildcats a 25-15 set victory. In the middle set the Huskies had no chance against the ‘Cats. Northwestern went on an 11-0 run to push its opening lead all the way to 14-4. The Wildcats went on two more shorter runs three and four points respectively and waltzed to an easy 25-13 set victory. The third set continued the trend of the matchup with a long Wildcats’ scoring run being the difference maker. Leading 7-6 Northwestern ripped off seven straight points highlighted by three kills from Kathryn Randorf to open its lead to 14-6. The Huskies could not make a comeback and the Wildcats took the set 25-14 completing their second sweep of the weekend. Sangiacomo and Randorf combined for 21 kills and Rosseau tallied another 33 assists. Husemann and Maddy Chinn added 10 blocks on the defensive end. The Wildcats only had five attacking errors all game and posted a .536 hitting percentage. Game Three at Fairfield In its final game of the weekend NU traveled down I-95 to Connecticut to take on the Fairfield Stags. In the opening set the Wildcats found themselves behind 11-9; however Northwestern got scorching hot and never looked back. The ‘Cats went on a 14-4 run with the trio of Sangiacomo Randorf and Hill raining spikes down to give NU the 23-15 lead. Chinn topped the set off with a kill to deliver NU the opening set victory 25-15. The Wildcats stayed ablaze in the second set jumping out to a 14-6 lead with two aces from Rousseau starting the rally and two straight blocks from Randorf and Hill. Fairfield had no answers for Northwestern as NU took the set 25-15. In the final set NU once again put the frame away before it even started. The Wildcats sprung out to a 12-6 advantage and followed it up with another five-point run to stretch the lead to 18-9 making the game out of reach for any Stags comeback. One last block from Hill and Rylan Reid ended the match with a 25-13 set victory and NU’s third sweep of the weekend. Sangiacomo once again paced Northwestern with 14 kills. Hill added eight kills of her own as well as four blocks. As a team NU had a hitting percentage of .411.

Share this story On Saturday Northwestern Football had one of the best days in recent memory: not only did they capture their first win in America since 2021 but the Wildcats had an offensive field day in a 38-7 win over UTEP. It was a much-needed day for NU who has obviously struggled over the past few years. While Saturday was a big day for a program it was a win over UTEP a non-power five team that finished under .500 a year ago. Northwestern has to buckle up as their schedule is only going to get harder. Next up is No.21 Duke who already beat a previously-ranked top-ten team this season at home. More formidable teams are on the way too as Big Ten play kicks into full swing in two weeks. So the question is this: how can the Wildcats maintain their competition against better opponents? It comes from playing complimentary football with contributions coming from offense to defense to special teams. Starting with the offense who has a tough three weeks coming up including squaring off against Mike Elko’s star-studded Duke defense Minnesota who had the number two defense in the Big Ten last year and Penn State who has gone under a defensive transformation with second-year coordinator Manny Diaz. Like every offense it starts with the quarterback position. Ben Bryant is day-to-day and assuming he is the starter on Saturday it’s about consistency. This means making the throws necessary to win ballgames and limit turnovers. Also against these elite defenses he needs to make one two or even more “wow’’ throws that move the offense forward. Of course to make these throws the offensive line needs to give him the time to. The offensive line did not perform well against a decent pass rush in Rutgers and the Wildcats will face much better pass rushes. The line needs to perform or else Bryant or whoever is back there will be eaten alive. Last is skill positions — between A.J. Henning Cam Johnson Cam Porter and others Northwestern has some talent. Is it more talent than many of their opponents? No probably not. But they have the capability to make plays and they will need to. Switching to the defensive side of the ball David Braun’s unit has shown flashes of potential over the past few weeks to be an average or even good defense for the rest of the season. At the same time the group needs to take steps forward. What was noticeable against Rutgers was the defensive struggles in the trenches one of the main reasons Northwestern lost that game. Scarlet Knights’ QB Gavin Wimsatt had tons of time to throw. The Wildcats need to disrupt quarterbacks and it starts by getting back there. Whether it is Anto Saka Richie Hagarty Sean McLaughlin or someone else the D-Line needs to get pressure or they are going to leave the ‘Cats’ secondary out to dry. The main place the defensive line struggled with last season was rush defense and obviously this needs to change against better opponents. Braun has stated he likes the potential in the room and the question now is whether results will show. Last is pass coverage which was probably Northwestern’s only not-below-average category in the Big Ten last season. While there was a lot of turnover in the secondary including the losses of A.J. Hampton Cam Mitchell and Jeremiah Lewis there is also a lot of talent. Devin Turner Garnett Hollis Jr. Rod Heard II Coco Azema and Theran Johnson have all had their moments through two games and the starting secondary has been good. It also comes down to pass coverage by linebackers. One of the struggles in Jim O’Neil’s scheme was linebackers not being able to matchup with speedy tight ends and running backs. There have already been positives in Braun’s defense: Bryce Gallagher and Xander Mueller both had interceptions Saturday. There is clear potential in pass coverage. Last is the coaching. David Braun a first-year head coach has no easy slate and he is aware he has to make adjustments depending on the opponents and performance. Going forward Northwestern will be facing MUCH more talented teams and as listed above every position will need to contribute for David Braun’s team to be competitive. The challenge will change each week. The same question remains: will the Wildcats remain competitive like so many in the program think they can?

Olsen @InvrrtedFB  Sep 13, 2023,  2:38pm CDT      / new","Men’s soccer: Unbeaten run continues, propels Wildcats into the Top 25", Magical things keep happening at Martin Stadium. Share this story The ‘Cats are rolling. After two more victories in the past week both against Illinois-based teams at home their record now sits at five wins one draw and still zero losses.  The nation is starting to take notice of what’s brewing in Evanston as well. Rom Brown was named in the College Soccer News National Team of the Week. Justin Weiss earned Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week honors. To top it all off Northwestern found itself ranked 19th in the latest edition of the United Soccer Coaches Top 25 — highest among all Big Ten teams. In the midst of this stream of optimism and good news surrounding the program there’s no way I could be anything but positive about NU’s prospects heading forward right? Well the answer to that question is pretty obvious. I’m still skeptical of the ‘Cats’ ability to keep winning matches in the manner they’ve been winning them especially considering the two contests covered later in this article.  They do certain things well and are still clearly in need of improvement in other areas but here is the bottom line: This is the best side Russell Payne has fielded across his three seasons here. While the question “How good is Northwestern really” remains unanswered and while I am extremely interested in the answer right now I do not care and neither should you. This is a group of players that have gone through some truly horrible seasons results-wise and now they’re soaring. They’re working for each other they’re giving their all to execute the game plan the coaches have given them and they’re reaping the rewards.  As much as I enjoy being the armchair quarterback of this team ultimately as a student at this university with a love for this crazy game my desire to see this team succeed trumps everything else. Long may the victories continue. Friday Sept. 8 (Evanston Ill.) I expressed positive feelings toward Northwestern’s tactical consistency last week so naturally Payne and co. altered the construction of the team a fair bit in the first game after that article was published.  First out of possession the ‘Cats switched from a back four to five lining up in a 5-2-1-2. Against Northern Illinois’ 4-2-1-3 that would presumably look something like the below diagram. In practice however it was a completely different story. While the Wildcats nominally set up in a back five they hardly ever had a flat line of five defenders at the back.  This is because at the start of every Husky sequence the ball-side NU WB would push up onto the ball-side NIU FB. The remaining four in the last line would shift across accordingly with the nominal WCB on that side taking up a FB-esque position forming an extremely asymmetric 4-3-1-2. For example when the Northern Illinois RCB (No. 18) started with the ball Fritz Volmar at LWB would move toward No. 24 at RB while Owen Noverr then slid across behind him to mark the Husky RW (No. 25). Looking at the above image it’s not hard to infer what the decision-making process of No. 18 would be in this situation — the LB (No. 3) is in a lot of space (far more than his right-sided counterpart) so the ball should head in that direction. Even if he wanted to play to the right Ugo Achara Jr.’s pressing run is going be curved toward NIU’s right initially to prevent passes from heading in that direction. So No. 18 plays across to No. 17 at LCB with the idea that he will then find No. 3 in space. And that would be a fine idea except for the fact Northwestern wants this as well. Weiss jumps to No. 17 as soon as the pass is played and Brown originally on the right of a double pivot begins moving in the direction of the Husky LB. This also means Collin McCamy the other half of the pivot is solely responsible for NIU’s AM (No. 13) so he adjusts his position to account for this man-orientation.  At this point you should see what’s coming. With no other options No. 17 sends the ball No. 3’s way but Brown is closing in quickly as well. Northwestern more or less has its opponent trapped and just has to “finish” the press by actually winning back possession. As mentioned previously this pressing trap was also possible if the ball started on Northern Illinois’ left as Brandon Clagette would move out of his RWB position like Volmar did at LWB. NU would force play right trying to squeeze the Huskies to the touchline. Just as a side note this isn’t the first time Payne has implemented a “pendulum” press — last season’s contest with Loyola Chicago is the first example that jumps to mind — but this is the first usage of these particular mechanisms at least that I can recall.  Ultimately it worked well and NIU struggled to get settled in possession and really create anything of note in that phase of play. The Huskies did find success on the counter-attack however. With the ball Northwestern also modified its structure lining up in a 3-2-1-4 with both WBs venturing into high positions in their respective wide channels and a vertically staggered double pivot of Brown and McCamy. I would venture as far to say this was the most composed and controlled the ‘Cats have looked in possession in any of their matches this season especially in the first half. They by far and away had the best understanding the various patterns to temporize and escape any attempts from Northern Illinois at pressing. That alone creates a foundation of security which makes the ultimate goal — putting the ball in the net — much more attainable. The below clip typifies their possession play from this match well for a few reasons: pic.twitter.com/aNyKwTA5xG Of the four features listed above the last one easily played the biggest role in deciding the outcome of this game. The ‘Cats got on the scoresheet first in the 14th minute with Brown rising highest to head home a McCamy corner and that was only the beginning of the Huskies’ woes defending crosses. Time and time again in the second half NU would send the ball into the box from wide areas and a Wildcat would get first contact. NIU nearly held on to a draw by somehow escaping a multitude of goalmouth scrambles unscathed but its luck ran out at the worst possible time — 15 seconds from the final whistle. A Justin Weiss flick-on of an Ibrahim Obeid cross fell kindly to Brown unmarked at the back post and like Declan Rice in a similar situation against Manchester United earlier this month a right-footed volley from the DM beat the GK at the now-near post to win the game. Monday Sept. 11 (Evanston Ill.) Like the ‘Cats UIC entered this match boasting a 4-1-0 record. And like the ‘Cats UIC had tallied wins against NJIT and St. Thomas but the Flames won by much more flattering margins. Additionally the visitors had defeated one of NU’s conference colleagues Wisconsin just a week prior. All this to say there’s a strong argument to be made this was Northwestern’s toughest test to date. Based on the scoreline you’d have to say the ‘Cats aced the exam but in reality this match was much closer than that. Despite Payne only making two like-for-like changes to the lineup that started against Northern Illinois — Jackson Weyman returning between the sticks and Reese Mayer getting the nod ahead of Noverr at LCB — the structure of the team was reorganized. Thankfully that alteration wasn’t anything major or anything new. Instead of a 5-2-1-2 without the ball with a front two of Weiss and Achara Jr. the former dropped to LW while Clagette was pushed up to RW from RWB.  In short it was back to a 4-2-3-1 press but the IP structure was the exact same. As previously mentioned this was a close game and based on the run of play I’d be inclined to say the Flames edged it slightly. However and as you can probably guess looking at the final score NU completely dominated in the “moments” of the match and did that in the most quintessentially Northwestern 2023 Men’s Soccer ways. If elements of the goals scored sound familiar that’s because they should: If it wasn’t clear already the ‘Cats will go as far as their potency in transition and from set pieces will take them. Conversely their lack of ingenuity and quality in settled play will establish a limit on how far they can go.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Michigan (2-0 0-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 1 Last Result: 35-7 win vs. UNLV Next: vs. Bowling Green It’s hard not to be optimistic about the Wolverines who have outscored their opponents by 55 points over the first two weeks as coach Jim Harbaugh serves his suspension. In short they did exactly what dominant Power Five teams are supposed to do against non-conference opponents. Michigan should have another shoo-in at home against 1-1 Bowling Green next week having to wait until Week 4 for their first Big Ten matchup again at home against a middling Rutgers team. 2. Penn State (2-0 0-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 2 Last Result: 63-7 win vs. Delaware Next: at Illinois Like their conference-mates in The Great Lake State Penn State has yet to be adequately challenged by their non-conference opponents. West Virginia and Delaware might be top dogs in the Big 12 and CAA respectively but they looked like middle school teams against Big Ten receiving leader KeAndre Lambert-Smith and the Nittany Lions. Penn State will have the chance to play their first conference opponent in Illinois next week though it’s unlikely that an Illini pass defense that ranks dead last in the Big Ten in efficiency will have much of an answer for them. 3. Ohio State (2-0 1-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 3 Last Result: 35-7 win vs. Youngstown State Next: vs. Western Kentucky Ohio State may have lost Heisman finalist quarterback C.J. Stroud to the NFL but junior Kyle McCord has taken the reins and run away with the job over these first two weeks leading a passing game that ranks first in the conference in yards per game. The Buckeyes will have their second non-conference matchup of the season against 2-0 Western Kentucky in Week 3 in which they’ll face Conference-USA’s best passing offense. 4. Maryland (2-0 0-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 6 Last Result: 38-20 win vs. Charlotte Next: vs. Virginia The Maryland run game was on full display against Charlotte last weekend with quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa taking a back seat as running backs Roman Hemby Colby McDonald and Billy Edwards Jr. combined for 234 total yards and 3 TDs. Tagovailoa had a touchdown of his own along with an impressive 287 yards on a 25/36 completion percentage but he’ll likely have to take command against a struggling yet seasoned Virginia team next week. 5. Michigan State (2-0 0-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 9 Last Result: 45-14 win vs. Richmond Next: vs. Washington The suspension and impending termination of head coach Mel Tucker amidst a sexual harassment investigation undoubtedly leaves the Spartans’ future looking cloudy but it’s hard to knock them down in the rankings until they show that they can’t win without their coach. Michigan State has bodied their non-conference opponents thus far outscoring them by 55 points thanks to their ability to catch the football and prevent their opponents from doing so. However they’ll face their first real threat this Saturday hosting No. 8 Washington.  6. Iowa (2-0 0-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 5 Last Result: 20-13 win at Iowa State Next: vs. Western Michigan The Hawkeyes have checked off some important early season wins especially last week against in-state rival Iowa State but they haven’t beaten the brakes off their opponents like other 2-0 Big Ten teams have. Brian Ferentz’s offense has looked anemic against non-conference opponents averaging a conference-worst 3.1 rushing yards per attempt. The passing game is as bad as its ground counterpart posting the third-worst completion percentage and passing yards per attempt in the Big Ten. Iowa’s defense has kept them in games but as the competition gets harder it’s tough to be optimistic about Iowa. 7. Wisconsin (1-1 0-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 4 Last Result: 31-22 loss at Washington State Next: vs. Georgia Southern Despite the Badgers dropping a game to the Pac-12’s Washington State this week Braelon Allen and Chez Mellusi have emerged as the Big Ten’s most lethal ground attack with Mellusi in particular averaging almost twice as many yards per carry as he did in 2022. The bane of this team has been their defense with the defensive line in particular being inept at stopping the opponents’ running game and giving quarterbacks too much time to make decisions. Wisconsin will have another tune-up at home against Georgia Southern next week before going on the road and facing their first Big Ten opponent in Week 4. 8. Illinois (1-1 0-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 8 Last Result: 34-23 loss at Kansas Next: vs. Penn State Unlike the 2022 Fighting Illini team the offense seems to be leading the way win or lose. That’s not to say that they’ve been anything special but the defense has been absolutely horrendous. Their 224 yards allowed per game on the ground makes them the worst in the Big Ten by 87.5 yards a gap that’s barely smaller than the one between the conference’s second-worst team and the best team. To make matters worse they’ll be running up against arguably the conference’s best ground attack in Nicholas Singleton Kaytron Allen and Penn State next week — which might show us the football equivalent of running a buzzsaw through a sheet of balsa wood. 9. Minnesota (2-0 1-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 7 Last Result: 25-6 win vs. Eastern Michigan Next: at North Carolina At first glance it might seem like Minnesota is ranked far too low on this list. But there’s plenty of reason to believe that there’s more going on under the hood than what their 2-0 record and one conference win show on the surface. The Golden Gophers handled a weak Eastern Michigan team last week but were barely able to scratch out their conference win against a proven terrible Nebraska squad during week one. Their offense mounted one decent drive in the second quarter but came away with only a field goal. If not for some 4th quarter heroics by quarterback Athan Kaliakmanis and receiver Daniel Jackson we’d be seeing this team a lot further down the list. 10. Rutgers (2-0 1-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 10 Last Result: 36-7 win vs. Temple Next: vs. Virginia Tech Has Rutgers taken advantage of some weak opponents? Sure but handling business early has cemented their status as the best of the Big Ten’s basement dwellers.  Through the first two weeks of play no one in the conference has been better at stopping the run than the Scarlet Knights holding opponents to 40 yards per game and 1.7 yards per attempt.  The Scarlet Knights have their first real test of the season next week when they take on a 1-1 Virginia Tech team at home and they’ll have to show they can defend against a Power Five offense that isn’t the Northwestern Wildcats. 11. Indiana (1-1 0-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 13 Last Result: 41-7 win vs. Indiana State Next: vs. Louisville The Hoosiers rebounded nicely from a throttling at the hands of Ohio State to put a beating of their own on in-state rival Indiana State. Running back Jaylin Lucas turned on the jets early on burning State for a pair of 25-yard touchdown runs to help end the game before it even really started. Indiana will face their second Power Five opponent of the season when they take on 2-0 Louisville next week giving us a chance to see how they fare against a more evenly-matched team than they’ve seen so far. 12. Purdue (1-1 0-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 11 Last Result: 24-17 win at Virginia Tech Next: vs. Syracuse The Boilermakers were able to take down a decent Virginia Tech team last week by one score but with a +3 point differential in the season thus far while playing two non-conference opponents it’s tough to envision much success for this team as we move closer to Big Ten play. Purdue has been the worst team in the Big Ten at defending the pass allowing 323 yards per game highlighted by Fresno State quarterback Mikey Keene torching them for 366 yards and four touchdowns in a Week 1 shootout. They’ll face their second straight ACC opponent when they welcome Syracuse to West Lafayette this weekend giving them another chance to see if their offense can make up for their inability to get stops. 13. Northwestern (1-1 0-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 14 Last Result: 38-7 win vs. UTEP Next: at Duke Northwestern fans need to enjoy this one while it lasts. After allowing UTEP to drive down the field and score on the first possession of the game the Wildcats put on a show on both sides of the ball jumping out to an impressive 28-7 lead heading into the fourth quarter before tacking on some garbage time points for good measure. While it’s certainly a bit encouraging to see Northwestern clobbering bad teams (something they didn’t do last season) their one-game win streak will likely come to an end at the hands of an upstart Duke squad coached by former Northwestern baseball parent Mike Elko. 14. Nebraska (0-2 0-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 12 Last Result: 36-14 loss at Colorado Next: vs. Northern Illinois The Cornhuskers suffered the unfortunate fate of becoming Deion Sanders’ punching bag on national television mostly thanks to lackluster performances by quarterback Jeff Sims and their offensive line. Nebraska had come close to beating Minnesota in Week 1 but a four-point lead was not enough to withstand a fourth-quarter collapse. Despite facing opponents that weren’t exactly shoo-ins they’ll sit at the bottom of the Big Ten for now waiting for conference play to possibly improve their fortunes or at least take some of their fellow basement dwellers down a peg.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Welcome back to the film room. For the first time since I started writing this piece last season I can finally say it is a victorious film review. After nearly 700 days Northwestern had won a game on American Soil thrashing the UTEP Miners 38-7. Furthermore it was the offensive performance the Wildcats needed after their abysmal showing in Piscataway to kick off the season.  NU had nearly 400 yards of total offense including 184 on the ground. It was all about the ground game this week for the ‘Cats after putting up just one rushing yard before the last two minutes of their season opener. NU ran the ball 39 times against the Miners averaging nearly five yards a carry. Because of how effective NU was on the ground the Wildcats barely put the ball in the air.  Removing Joseph Himon’s 85-yard touchdown on a screen  the ‘Cats passed for 122 yards on only 13 completions. Ben Bryant NU’s starting quarterback was not the only gunslinger to see action this past weekend. With Bryant leaving the game midway through the third quarter with an injury Ryan Hilinski Jack Lausch and Cole Freeman all saw snaps under center. While all four did play there are no real passes to break down so this piece will solely focus on the sixth-year’s play. The Numbers It was a conservative yet efficient day for No.2. Bryant was 11-for-17 for 116 yards and a touchdown before leaving the game early with an injury. His yards per attempt jumped to nearly seven yards after not clipping the five-yard mark last week.  PFF graded Bryant at a 70.7 passing grade in Week Two a significant jump from his abysmal 30.1 grade in Week One. After having five turnover-worthy plays against Rutgers Bryant dropped that number all the way to zero in NU’s home opener. As you will see later the film shows that the Cincinnati transfer did a better job protecting the football. When adjusted for receiver drops PFF says the sixth-year would have completed 75% of his passes. Furthermore the ‘Cats’ signal-caller was vastly improved under pressure this past week. The ball was out of No. 2’s hands in 2.26 seconds nearly half a second faster than in the season opener. He was much more efficient too completing 50% of his passes when feeling the heat.  After attempting to air it out last week and making costly mistakes NU called a more conservative gameplan in Week Two. Bryant only attempted five passes more than ten yards past the line of scrimmage but kept the Wildcats ahead of the sticks with underneath passes. Here is a breakdown of where No. 2 went with the football against the Miners. The stats do not jump off the paper but it was a significant improvement from the sixth-year’s debut in purple and white. With that being said let’s jump into the tape. The Good Even though there were limited opportunities Bryant showed plenty of improvement in the Wildcats’ home opener. The bar was low but it was encouraging to see him have success under center. Interim head coach David Braun kept mentioning that the offense never had a chance to get rolling against Rutgers because it was never on the field. This week Bryant extended drives with multiple third-down completions allowing NU to stay on the field. This was Bryant’s best throw of the day. He starts looking right to his first read but quickly darts his eyes across the field to the rest of his progression. The pocket collapses around Bryant as the defender barrels down the sixth-year stands tall and rifles a ball to Cam Johnson for a third down conversion and huge play. Sure Johnson did most of the work to get the ball to midfield but this is a big-time throw from Bryant. He zips this ball into the open spot of the Cover Four-zone right past the curl linebacker to move the chain. He anticipated where No. 14 would be and threw the ball on time allowing Johnson to run after making the grab. With Northwestern backed up against its own end zone a punt would have set the Miners up in good field position to retake the lead; instead NU dug out of its own territory and flipped the field. Despite having to punt later in the drive this play helped the Wildcats keep UTEP off the board and win its first game in over a year. In another third-and-long situation Northwestern runs two clear routes and leaves A.J. Henning underneath for the first down. This is a simple one-read play where if Henning is smothered the ball should get to the checkdown instantly. Bryant recognizes the coverage and with a clean pocket delivers a strike to Henning to move the chains. This ball has to come out on time as a linebacker is sitting in the middle hole to take away the middle of the field. Bryant fits the ball in between the outside linebacker and the middle ‘backer for an easy pitch and catch. With a clean pocket Bryant has shown he can throw with timing and put his receivers in good spots a marquee of a good quarterback. Last week I was frustrated by the lack of getting the ball outside on RPOs to get ahead of the sticks. Well this week Northwestern took advantage of the Miners respecting the run game. This is as easy as it will get for a QB. The corner is playing eight yards off the ball and backpedaling so take the free five yards. Bryant recognizes the space pre-snap aborts the run mesh and flings it out to Johnson for five yards. It is a lot easier for an offense to be successful when it avoids third-and-long situations so picking up five yards on first down is ideal. Bryant does not hesitate and helps NU stay ahead of the sticks. This is another great example of just taking the easy completion. UTEP comes out in man coverage and the corner on the top of the screen is eight yards off the line of scrimmage and instantly drops into his backpedal. Bryce Kirtz runs a three-step slant and Bryant slings it to No. 17 for a first down. There is no chance the defender can make a play on the ball especially if it comes out on time. Bryant does not even take a drop; he just hitches and gets the ball to Kirtz instantly. These are gimmes but it was encouraging to see the sixth-year get the ball out with rhythm to his targets. The Bad To be honest I’m knit-picking here. I thought the ‘Cats’ signal-caller played a clean game. However there are always things that need to be cleaned up. It is hard when you are a competitor but Bryant needs to protect himself more. He is the starting quarterback behind a shaky O-line so taking extra punishment is a recipe for disaster. I still believe this is the play where Bryant was injured and had to leave the game. A high snap from Ben Wrather turns this into a broken play and No. 2 tries to will his way into the endzone; instead he takes a massive hit. I know Bryant is trying to make a play but cutting it back inside and lowering the shoulder is not a great idea. It is a down territory pick up as much as you can but go down — there are still two more chances to get three yards. The play was already busted and now Bryant is taking a major hit. If he wants to stay healthy for the rest of the season especially against bigger Big Ten opponents the sixth-year needs to learn to go down and avoid the big hit. Northwestern played a good game but it missed a few opportunities to blow this game open earlier than it did. With UTEP playing man coverage Mike Bajakian wisely puts Himon all the way out as a receiver drawing a linebacker in coverage. Himon uses his speed and blows right by his defender becoming wide open down the sideline; however Bryant overshoots him. Just like with Henning in Week One NU had a chance to hit a big play but the QB can’t get the ball to the receiver. Is it a timing issue? Maybe. But at some point the Wildcats will need to connect on a deep ball to win football games. The conservative play style works when playing a less talented opponent but NU will have to get more aggressive as it dives into conference play. Final Thoughts  After Week One questions about whether Bryant should remain the starter swirled across the internet. While this past week did not display a strong air attack Bryant demonstrated that he can effectively lead the ‘Cats’ offense. As the competition increases No.2 will have to show he can play high-level football. However this week was leaps and bounds ahead of what we witnessed in New Jersey. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Both golf teams opened their 2023-24 campaigns earlier this week and as one would expect both squads had things to clean up. However there was also a lot of promise shown especially in the odd-numbered rounds. If both teams are able to reach a consistent level of play they should be tough outs all year long. Men’s Golf ""The mens team opened the season in Independence Minnesota as part of the 14-team Gopher Invitational. The Wildcats finished in a tie for fifth after a spectacular first two rounds followed by a return to the middle of the pack over the final round. By the end of the invitational the ‘Cats finished with a 3-over 855 just 10 strokes behind the victorious UNC-Wilmington team."" Northwestern opened the tournament with a 1-over 285 as a team on their first official day of competition. Led by junior Cameron Adam who shot a 1-under 70 and sophomore Daniel Svärd who shot an even-par 71 the Wildcats were just one stroke behind eventual winner UNC Wilmington and second-place finisher Kent State. The second day was even better for the Wildcats. Svärd shot a 3-under 68 and three other Wildcats (Adam graduate student James Imai and sophomore Ethan Tseng) all shot 70s. The total round score of a 6-under 278 was tied for the second-best round of any team all tournament and it brought the ‘Cats into a tie with UNC-Wilmington heading into the final day of the invitational. Unfortunately for the Wildcats their podium-level play ran out in the third round. After shooting 5-under as a team through the first two rounds the ‘Cats were only able to produce an 8-over-par round of 292. Not a single Wildcat broke par and the best individual score for the third round was a 2-over 73. However Northwestern was still able to earn a tie for fifth despite the rough round mainly thanks to the buffer the team had built up over the first two rounds. In terms of individual play the Wildcats put three players in the top 20. Svärd the defending Big Ten Freshman of the Year and Adam both finished tied for 15th thanks to shooting an even-par 213 for the tournament. Tseng finished in a tie for 18th thanks to his 1-over 214 while Imai finished tied for 31st after shooting a 3-over 216. Niall Shiels-Donegan the Wildcats’ fifth golfer finished tied for 51st thanks to his 8-over 221. The team will return to action later this month when it hosts the Windon Memorial Classic in Northfield Illinois on Sept. 25 and 26. Women’s Golf As for the women’s side the Wildcats reversed the fortunes of the men. At the Branch Law Firm/Dick McGuire Invitational in Albuquerque New Mexico the women’s team started poorly but put together their best round in the final round. Despite the brilliant 3-under 285 in the third round the Wildcats couldn’t overcome their earlier performance and finished tied for 12th in the 16-team event. The first round was extremely unkind to Northwestern. First-year Ashley Yun was the only Wildcat to shoot even par at 72 with all four of her teammates shooting at least 4-over on the round. When the dust settled Northwestern had shot a 14-over 302 for the day putting the team just one stroke ahead of a tie for last. The second round was a slight improvement. While Yun shot 4-over par not a single Wildcat shot worse than 5-over par and junior Lauren Nguyen shot a 1-over 73 to lead the way for the team. While the 11-over 299 wasn’t ideal it did help stop the team’s backward momentum. It also helped set the stage for its stunning third round. In that round the Wildcats came out on fire. All five players shot 74 or better and both Nguyen and sophomore Dianna Lee were able to shoot under par the first such instances of a Wildcat golfer doing so at the tournament. As a whole the team shot a three-under 285 in the third round tied for the second-best round of any team all day behind only runner-up Kansas which shot a 274 in the third round. Tournament winner Pepperdine shot a 270 in the second round en route to a 14-under 850 for the tournament. Northwestern’s 22-over 886 was 36 strokes behind.  As for the individuals Northwestern put just a single player in the top 25 but did have four in the top 50.

Share this story After nearly 700 days without a win in America or at Ryan Field Northwestern finally snapped its painful drought with a 38-7 romping over UTEP last Saturday. The energy radiating from Evanston was at long last quite positive — but a much more formidable stretch of opponents begins for the next three weeks catalyzed by the No. 21 Duke Blue Devils. To gather more information on Mike Elko’s upstart squad Inside NU had the pleasure to be joined by Devils Illustrated’s Conor O’Neill who provided intel about Duke’s talent and strengths. Inside NU: Following an upset over Clemson and a 2-0 start what are the expectations surrounding Duke for the rest of the year? What’s the general mood surrounding the program in and around the community and is there as much optimism from the inside as it seems from the outside? Conor O’Neill: Yeah I think so. Mike Elko’s really kind of changed the culture as much as you can for a new coach a year and two games into a tenure. Duke is for the foreseeable future it’s going to be a basketball school the “school.” But football rules everything and there’s certainly an awareness that Duke is going to have to be good at football too. I think there’s more of a dedication to it than there was under David Cutcliffe. Expectations for this program this year kind of change when you knock off Clemson start the season. I sat there and looked at the schedule for eight months and wrote all kinds of stuff about how much more challenging Duke’s schedule is this year. The easiest way to put it is the ACC moved away from divisions so everybody’s playing everybody and Duke was in what I would refer to as the JV division. Last year they played all five of the ACC that didn’t make bowl games. This year they only play one of those five schools. They’re the only ACC team that seven of their eight conference games are against teams that were in bowls last year and then they also get Notre Dame thrown onto their schedule because Notre Dame is a halfway ACC member this year with six games against them. I said stuff like ‘If you’re gonna get Clemson it’s good to get them in Game One when you’re theoretically at your healthiest.’ I also cover Wake Forest and I’ve seen Wake play Clemson in November when their depth is really running thin at a few positions and Clemson just has so much more talent and so much more depth. They can really exploit some matchups. I said that ‘If you’re gonna get Clemson it’s best to get them in Game One of the new quarterback and offensive coordinator combo instead of Game Four Game Six Game 10 when they’re probably a little more cohesive and the communication is a little quicker.’ Then they go out and beat Clemson 28-7 and you’re thinking like Oh this is for real. This is not a rebuilding project where Duke is going to take another two or three years to where they can compete at the top of the league. They’ve positioned themselves to compete this year. That just kind of recalibrates everything that’s out there. I mean to Elko’s credit: he’s never called it a “rebuilding year.” He’s never said that ‘We’re just trying to get through this year with a bowl berth. It’s all been about ‘We’re gonna win with the players that we have right now.’ He’s he’s 11-4 and [of] the four losses the most lopsided loss was an eight-point loss at Kansas last year. Things are going pretty well. INU: In last year’s Duke-Northwestern matchup RB Jaylen Coleman was a big factor gaining 83 rushing yards and a score on 11 carries. What’s the status of Coleman for Saturday? CO: He got hurt toward the end of fall camp. I think it’s an upper body injury. I think he’s kind of a game-to-game week-to-week situation. The benefit Duke has right now is they’re not in a position to rush him back because they have two other experienced running backs they’re comfortable with with Jordan Waters and Jaquez Moore. I think Waters had a good against Northwestern last year. They pretty much stick with two of them [running backs] and then go to the third if they need it and Moore was the third if they needed it last year. They didn’t really need it with with Waters and Coleman running really well but Moore and Waters have run really well this year. They’ve got a freshman they feel really good about in Peyton Jones. As they’ve got three healthy backs that they feel confident in throwing back there and giving the ball to I don’t know if they’re in any rush to get Jaylen Coleman back. It’s all calculus of the longer you go without Jaylen Coleman the more likely you are one of the guys you’re playing gets hurt. Then that’s when you actually need Jaylen Coleman to come in because you always want to have two and then a third option to throw in there. INU: Duke’s three scrimmage yard leaders (Waters Moore Riley Leonard) have done the bulk of their work on the ground. Who are some of the options for Leonard through the air and do you expect that to be something the Blue Devils try to utilize against a strong Northwestern secondary? CO: There’s kind of a feeling of I don’t think they’re gonna run the ball for 220 yards against everybody. I think they are going to open it up at some point — I just don’t know when that is and I don’t know if it’s ever going to be their emphasis to start a game. I think Kevin Johns the offensive coordinator is just going to stick with a run run run to set up the pass. The top options there’s basically three with Jalon Calhoun Jordan Moore and Shamir Hagans. Those are the three guys that played a ton of snaps last year at receiver positions. They’re all pretty small and shifty. Losing Eli Pancol in the first week of fall camp really robbed Duke of their big body downfield receiver threat. He had a 100-yard game against Northwestern last year and I think 81 of it came off the same catch and run all the way down the sideline. They haven’t ruled him out for the year but he’s not playing in this game. He won’t play until I think November at the earliest. That’s one of the things that we’re kind of waiting to see who: the downfield deep ball threat will be because they don’t have anybody experienced in that category other than a tight end with Nicky Dalmolin which which could be an option there. It’s kind of you don’t know what you don’t know. We saw some fall camp practices. It’s just it’s a difference between doing it in fall camp against your own DBs and doing it in a game. They haven’t had to do it in a game against anybody yet. INU: Defensively the Blue Devils have allowed only 14 points all year. What do you think has been particularly successful for that unit? CO: The biggest area of emphasis for Elko moving past last year and throughout spring and summer fall camp was he wanted to see them play ball more aggressively in the air. He wanted to see some more of their technique that he teaches. I’m not into the football Xs and Os enough to be able to describe exactly what it is but it’s one of those where you know it when you see it. This team does play the ball a lot better in the air. They’ve got three interceptions already; one against Clemson was off a deflected pass into the air so that was decent. The other two against Lafayette — which granted you’ve got to throw the FCS caveat in there — but it was Myles Jones a seventh-year guy who transferred from Texas A&M; Six-foot-4 probably the biggest corner I’ve ever seen on college team — and Joshua Pickett — a returning starter who’s actually not a starter this year. They both just went up and made one-on-one plays on the ball for interceptions. They did not do that very much last year. Part of it was who they were trying to do it with and part of it was the technique wasn’t there. So to see them do it — again it’s a Lafayette — but to see two of those plays happen. If I’m remembering the box scores correctly they’ve got 12 passes broken up by 10 different players. It’s a lot of guys getting into the mix and getting their hands on balls. One of the storylines last year that’s kind of continued is their defensive line is really good at coming up with batted passes. It’s just something that I think their Defensive Tackles Coach Jess Simpson and their Defensive Ends Coach Harland Bower do a really great job of teaching like the clock in a defensive lineman’s head: of one two three  I didn’t get to the quarterback let me get my hand up and get an arm in his throwing lane or get an arm in his vision. That kind of thing. They seem to be pretty decent at that and that continued from last year to this year. INU: How does the Duke community view Northwestern as an opponent especially after the scandals of the last few months? CO: I think there’s some acknowledgement of obviously a tough situation. The Duke staff has three coaches on it that come from Northwestern. Adam Cushing the offensive line coach he was a Northwestern lifer. I think 15 years or so on the staff. Kevin Johns the offensive coordinator spent some time there. I think Patrick Dougherty is the other one the tight ends/special teams coach. There’s some acknowledgement of the scandal. Mike Elko I think it was after the first fall camp practice gave a statement of support behind Adam Cushing. As far as how the Duke community views Northwestern I think it’s an acknowledgement of a like-minded school that we play in athletics. I can’t say with certainty that anybody wants to play Northwestern every season. I think Duke makes the trip back up there in ‘24 and then I think that’s the last game that’s on the books against Northwestern. But I can’t see them having any reason to not schedule each other for 20 years right? It makes too much sense. I get the sense Northwestern wants to play Power Five teams at least one time in the three-game non-conference slate that they get. [For] Duke it’s certainly always beneficial for ACC teams to play Big Ten or SEC schools. INU: How do you see this game shaking out? CO: I want to see which team opens it up first whether that’s Duke coming out and throwing right away whether it’s Northwestern with any number of quarterbacks. I want to see that. It’s tough to see Northwestern winning. I think Duke is really good. I think Duke is a pretty driven team. They looked great in the opener against Clemson and even if Clemson is not the Clemson of years past where they had the ACC in a stranglehold and they were a top-10 program still a really good team with a lot of talent. Duke went up and down the field and scored 22 unanswered points on them and threw a second-half shutout. It’s an impressive team that I think is going to keep climbing until the Sept. 30 matchup against Notre Dame. In a Q&A I gave somebody a score of 27-14 Duke so I would stick with that. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story The ‘Cats pulled out a much-needed feel-good victory at home last Saturday against UTEP. It was a win they needed to have in order to avoid another train wreck of a season and they succeeded in emphatic fashion downing the Miners 38-7. Ben Bryant still wasn’t awesome under center but he showed some promise and led Northwestern to a win. The rushing attack was also much-improved which had a tremendous impact. Overall it probably couldn’t have gone better for head coach David Braun and his team. Now we turn our attention to a matchup that has given NU fits in recent years. It’s the battle of the nerds this Saturday as the ‘Cats travel to play the No. 21 Duke Blue Devils. Here’s three reasons why Northwestern will pull off a season-altering upset and three reasons why fans should just focus their attention on Minnesota next week. Why Northwestern will beat Duke Cam Porter and the running game Last week I listed Porter and a rushing attack that struggled mightily in Week One as a reason the ‘Cats would lose to UTEP. I couldn’t have been more wrong. Northwestern gained 184 yards on the ground against the Miners and scored three touchdowns. Porter contributed 90 himself to go along with Jack Lausch’s 53 and A.J. Henning’s 35. Don’t get me wrong run blocking is going to be way tougher against Duke. It’s just flat-out better in pretty much every phase of the game than UTEP was. But Northwestern showed unquestionable improvement running the ball last weekend and I’m betting it will continue in Durham.  It’s also hard to fully believe in Bryant’s ability to attack a good secondary through the air just yet. If Clemson could only manage 209 air yards it feels like Bryant’s ceiling will be something close to what he did last week (11-for-17 for 116) and his floor closer to the numbers he put up in Week One. Duke has also allowed north of 120 yards rushing in both games so far this season (213 against Clemson and 126 against Lafayette). NU is going to need Porter and its offensive line to get something going. The players must really want this one You can talk numbers matchups and strategy all you want but at some point this is football. Who plays harder and who’s more dialed in matters. In this case the ‘Cats get to have the underdog mentality which is a positive thing. Especially given their recent history of losses against Duke there should be a fire within every returning player Northwestern has. Last year Northwestern lost this game at home in brutal fashion when Evan Hull fumbled the game away on the 1-yard line. It sucked the air out of the team and they didn’t win another game for the rest of the season.  These players undoubtedly remember that turning point and are using it for motivation this week as they prepare to go up against a much stronger Duke team than they faced last season. It may not be enough to win but effort will matter and I don’t expect Northwestern to come out flat like it did against Rutgers. A.J. Henning I listed Henning as a reason Northwestern would beat UTEP as well and while he wasn’t the most explosive ‘Cats player he had another solid day. Henning collected 51 all-purpose yards granted only 16 of those came through the air but he’s emerged as an option out of the backfield as well. I think this is the week he truly breaks out as a receiver. He’s had some impressive plays but it hasn’t really carried over to stats just yet. He has just six receptions for 58 yards in two games thus far. But he’s a versatile player in a fledgling offense. It’s tough for him to get touches everywhere. It’s that same versatility however that again makes him an X-factor against Duke. Whatever defensive weaknesses Northwestern is able to identify Henning can play a part in exploiting. He’s not their only chance at scoring points but if he’s catching passes making explosive runs AND productively returning kicks?? He’s going to matter. Why Northwestern won’t beat Duke Riley Leonard It isn’t every day in college football that you have to contend with a potential first-round pick in the NFL Draft. That’s what Northwestern will have to deal with against Leonard this Saturday. The junior is a big quarterback standing at 6-foot-4 and weighing in at 212 pounds and has been mocked as the third quarterback off the board this spring.  Now he hasn’t been completely dominant in either game so far but the first was against Clemson and the second was a blowout win in which Duke started running the ball early. His 311 yards and one TD throw don’t seem reflective of a top five talent in college football but don’t put too much stock into it. The thing is even if Leonard was overhyped heading into the season he’s still going to be a huge problem for Northwestern. There’s no doubt that he’s a lot more talented than anyone in the ‘Cats’ QB room and this young secondary is going to have its hands full trying to slow down Duke’s passing attack. Jordan Waters Yeah unfortunately it isn’t just the passing attack Northwestern has to worry about. Waters is a senior running back who has already amassed 175 yards on the ground and scored three touchdowns. He’s averaging eight yards per carry and has even sprinkled in some receiving numbers with 46 yards so far. The Northwestern run stoppers looked way better against UTEP than they did against Rutgers but this is by far the best team they’ve played all season. And let’s not sugarcoat it they were dreadful against the Scarlet Knights. If they look like that or somehow worse it’s going to be a long day trying to stop Waters. Ben Bryant Bryant is currently rocking a 58.5 completion percentage along with a 26.8 QBR (good enough for 125th in the nation). That isn’t good enough for a guy who was billed as a consistent starter who had had real success at Cincinnati.  He did get better against UTEP but it’s really tough to take stock in a game against a low-level opponent at home and he wasn’t even that good. He was just better than he was at Rutgers. Based on what we’ve seen so far this is not a matchup in which Bryant will excel. I’m betting the moment will be too big and he’ll shrink back into Rutgers form. There also just isn’t much working in Bryant’s favor. He’s got backup quarterbacks breathing down his neck. He has opposing defensive linemen literally breathing down his neck on every play. This literal and figurative pressure just seems like too much for him to overcome especially on the road against a ranked team that’s currently on the come-up. Maybe he’ll prove me wrong but it’s going to be tough. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you buy something from an SB Nation link Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Share this story After falling to Rutgers 24-7 and scoring any points with only 19 seconds left on the clock it’s no secret that pressure had been mounting on Mike Bajakian and Northwestern’s offense to produce. That stems beyond just the team’s Week One performance: with Bajakian at the helm NU’s offense has been one of the worst in the country averaging under 17 points per game in both 2021 and 2022. As both the UTEP Miners and Wildcats strolled into the Ryan Field locker rooms at halftime of Saturday’s contest it was looking as if the same languid NU offense would persist. The team seemed impressive on its first drive netting 71 yards and a touchdown on eight plays but then did nothing but punt on its next four possessions. In the second half however that changed radically. The ‘Cats punched the ball into the end zone on each of their first four drives of the third and fourth quarters and scored points on all meaningful possessions in the half. The final point total: 38 the most in a game for Northwestern since posting 43 against Maryland to start the 2020 season. Beyond just points accumulated it was a much more efficient and balanced day for NU on offense too. The team had a 44% success rate and 62% rushing success rate plus posted six explosive plays (10+-yard runs and 15+-yard passes). Converting six of 11 third-down tries was also a much more respectable figure. How were the Wildcats able to snap out of their offensive funk? A significant portion was due to the creativity of Bajakian. Whether varying personnel or utilizing designs to create confusion here were highlight-worthy elements of the OC’s gameplan on Saturday. With the ‘Cats and Miners deadlocked even into the third quarter Northwestern finally broke the tie courtesy of a gorgeous call from Bajakian. On second-and-10 the Wildcats use 11 personnel with one running back (Joseph Himon II) and one tight end (Thomas Gordon). To start the play Gordon fakes as if he’s blocking for Henning who takes steps back toward the line of scrimmage in a faux screen. A shoulder pump from Ben Bryant captures the eyes of two UTEP defenders. From there Gordon leaks out right past the Miner defense muscling over a defender for a score. This play is excellent because it not only builds upon something Northwestern uses on offense — screens — but pairs that with a late release to create eye candy. Although the first play showcased was a pass Bajakian’s strengths really manifested themselves in the run game which the rest of this film room will demonstrate. Against Rutgers Northwestern simply did not get adequate touches to its top playmakers specifically A.J. Henning and Jack Lausch. That changed enormously on Saturday with the two combining for 10 runs/carries for 114 yards and two scores. Let’s start with Lausch. The sophomore quarterback got his first run of the year with the Wildcats threatening inside the UTEP 10. Bajakian lined up Lausch under center but kept Bryant on the field — aligned to the slot to start — to generate some confusion. Before the snap Lausch motions Bryant closer to the ball but the run doesn’t follow that direction. Instead Lausch fakes a handoff to Cam Porter before scampering to the right for six. This play is outstanding because of how it puts the UTEP defensive end in conflict; him having to wait to see who has the ball enables Lausch to get an excellent angle. A good block from Cam Johnson also paves the way. That wasn’t the only significant Lausch carry of the day. With the Wildcats holding a 21-point advantage Bajakian turned to the youngster once again in the fourth quarter. While this zone read doesn’t hold as many wrinkles as the prior one it’s still executed beautifully courtesy of a tremendous lead by Gordon strong down block by Johnson and of course Lausch’s acceleration — all of which culminates in a 46-yard scamper. There’s little question that Henning is Northwestern’s most dynamic playmaker and athlete. Bajakian seemed to emphasize getting the Michigan transfer the ball in spades Saturday after he had six touches against Rutgers including two measly runs. On the team’s first drive of the game Henning was readily involved. Here the receiver collects a jet sweep from Bryant from the left side out of 13 personnel — Duke Olges and Charlie Mangieri help secure the edge to the right while Lang blocks out in space to set the perimeter. On top of that Porter helps Mangieri by closing off a UTEP defender and sealing Henning’s lane. This pop goes for 17 yards. With the element of Henning’s sweeps well established in his playbook Bajakian utilized that very concept to foster other successful designs. With 8:44 to go Henning motions from the right to left side of the formation drawing with him a UTEP defensive back. But Bryant hands off to Porter who runs an inside zone up the middle. Having one fewer UTEP player to defend the run works perfectly on this split zone as Porter sees an opening past Josh Thompson at RT hits the hole and picks up 16. Aside from implementing his elite athletes in a slew of ways Bajakian was also sound in presenting diverse looks in the team’s run game. Below are two examples that I was a big proponent of. On this first carry the ‘Cats line up in the pistol with Bryant in the shotgun and Porter behind him. Olges begins the play aligned as a receiver to the right side. This isn’t an ordinary run though. After the snap center Ben Wrather and right tackle Zach Franks both pull while Olges attacks straight downhill. That gets two big bodies out in space for Porter who waits for his blocks and ultimately gains nine. Bryant’s work on this play shouldn’t go overlooked either: him turning his head to the left before pitching it all the way around to Porter on his right isn’t the simplest or most conventional maneuver but he completed it quite well. Even on more basic run concepts Bajakian’s use of motion paid dividends. Take this tote by Porter in which Mangieri motions across the formation. The ability of Mangieri to get a head start on whamming Tyrice Knight (No. 10 for UTEP) allows the tight end to work all the way up the A gap before Knight can impact the play. Because of that block and the double from Wrather and Dom D’Antonio Porter plunges up the middle through a huge hole. Final Thoughts It was far from a picture-perfect afternoon for Bajakian’s unit on Saturday in spite of the point total it accrued. There were still consistent miscues — especially in the first half — whether blown blocks or inaccurate throws. All in all though Bajakian called a very good game balancing pass and run while still sprinkling in unique looks and traffic for UTEP defenders. It seemed as if Northwestern’s offense attacked the perimeter and between the numbers equally well consistently befuddling Miner defenders — especially because of decoys. Whether or not Bajakian’s gameplan looks similar in the next three weeks — starting with a Duke defense that’s allowed just 14 points all year — is yet to be seen. For as innovative as NU was on offense this week there was scarcely any ingenuity or success in the opener against the Scarlet Knights. Ultimately Bajakian is responsible for Northwestern’s offensive output even if he’s not the one throwing the passes or securing the blocks. Which version of NU’s O appears will dictate much of the rest of its season. But if Bajakian orchestrates similar concepts that give the ball to the Wildcats’ most explosive playmakers plus defy what defenders expect better results should eventually follow. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story I wouldn’t call it a slow start. In fact I wouldn’t dwell on the season-opening loss to No. 9 Louisville at all. If anything outshooting a team 21-to-3 with 10 shots on goal is nothing short of impressive. On another impressive note: this isn’t a seasoned-veteran type of team with the headlining names that propelled Northwestern to two straight championship appearances playing; rather young talent is now helping run the Wildcats’ game — which means dominating opponents.  Tracey Fuchs no longer has Bente Baekers to demoralize every defense she plays and top the leaderboards. Her loss is a huge one but this year’s team is getting contributions from all over and pretty evenly at that which hasn’t necessarily been the case in recent seasons. Northwestern has graduate students Alia Marshall and Peyton Halsey plus senior Lauren Wadas to bring established talent and skill — but just as much a part of this team and its five-game winning streak is a trio of new faces: first-years Olivia Bent-Cole and Ilse Tromp and sophomore Maja Zivojnovic who was sidelined for the majority of last season with an injury.  ""The starting roster looks different this season with underclassmen and players who are familiar but didn’t see a lot of minutes in the past. While its bizarre to have outshot the Cardinals so extremely — in fact Louisville only had one shot on goal— this is all the start of something new. Aside from not hitting the backboards the absolute domination of possession shows that this something new is promising. Of the plethora of Wildcat shots five came from Zivojnovic three came from Trompe and junior Lane Herbert each two came from Bent-Cole and junior Regan Cornelius Halsey and Marshall each attributed one. "" This game may go in the record books as a loss but it represents a roster with multiple players who can be factors. The ‘Cats’ aren’t centering their game around one or two scorers or relying just on veterans to move the ball. The young talent on the field spearheaded by two first-years represents players that will grow beloved by a fanbase.  That’s not a knock on any previous play but it signals how the Wildcats will find success this year: with incoming players already prepared to execute on this level and others ready to step up. And the next five games attest to that.  Against No. 17 Boston College Halsey knocked in the overtime winner but was assisted by Trompe who was playing just her second-ever collegiate game. Bent-Cole Trompe and Marshall collected the most shots.  In a 3-0 victory over No. 20 Duke Bent-Cole was the first to score after the Blue Devils put up two goals. Zivojnovic had two shots on goal which is a respectable tally. The trend continued. Against Vermont and UMass Halsey and Zivojnovic pitched in goals. Then it was Trompe scoring the first of what will likely be very many in her career. Bent-Cole and Relford matched the feat against Maine.  After this six-game stretch nine different players have tallied over five shots with Zivojnovic and Bent-Cole leading the pack with 18 and 15 respectively. They also both have two goals — tied for second on the team behind Halsey’s four.  There is of course a lot for Northwestern to still get under control. The ‘Cats are having no problem mustering shots and getting the rebounds but they can be much more efficient in finishing. With the exception of Duke where the Blue Devils outshot the Wildcats 17-7 Northwestern outshot Louisville Boston College Vermont Maine and UMass in a landslide: 21-to-3 13-to-8 22-to-2 26-to-5 and 19-to-5. Those are numbers representative of what can be an outstanding offense. With Annabel Skubisz in goal who was already named Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week this season Fuchs has a lethal combination.  NU is currently ranked No. 3 in the nation behind Iowa and North Carolina. Aside from Louisville which sits at fourth the Wildcats have yet to face the toughest games of their schedules.  This team has the making of something special considering how rare it is to see young players like Bent-Cole and Tromp instantly shine and how Zivojnovic playing as if she suited up every minute last season — not to mention having U.S. National Team members in Wadas and Marshall and a reigning captain in Halsey to lead the team. The ‘Cats will be put to the test in a stretch before the Big Ten Tournament where over the span of six games they’ll face No. 8 Michigan No. 1 Iowa No. 12 Penn State No. 10 Rutgers and No. 5 Maryland.

Share this story Fresh off its first trip to the NCAA Championship since 2002 Northwestern cross country has finally hit the grass. The ‘Cats kicked off their season with the Flyers Flames Challenge in nearby Romeoville on Sept. 1 before facing Big Ten competition in Madison at last Saturday’s Badger Classic. The first meet expectedly ended in a resounding Northwestern win. As a tune-up for some bigger races down the line the ‘Cats raced seven other smaller schools from around the area. Chicago State and UIC were the only other Division I teams at the meet and the Flames finished 27th of 33 teams at last year’s Midwest Regional while Northwestern placed second.  That may have played a role in prompting head coach Jill Miller to hold her stars out. None of NU’s four returners from its 2022 lineup — Ava Earl Anna Hightower Katherine Hessler and Kalea Bartolotto — raced two weeks ago. Consequently some of the first-years making their Wildcat debuts had a chance to shine. Anna Delgado of Lansing Michigan seized the moment. She took the win in the 4K race with a 14:21 17 seconds before anyone else crossed the line. That’s when fellow first-year Ava Criniti scored and she was quickly followed by Maddy Whitman Rachel Sessa and Erin Boler to complete the perfect score of 15. For good measure Deepti Choudhury came in five seconds after Boler to give Northwestern the top six individual spots in the race. All in all it was a good performance that showcased the potential of some of the sophomores and first-years who could snag a top-seven spot on the team. However the competition paled in comparison to what would lie ahead eight days later. In a de-facto Big Ten preview meet NU and some other conference powers headed up to Madison Wisconsin to familiarize themselves with the course where the conference championship will be held in late October. That made it a great environment for some of the conference’s top runners to make their season debuts. No. 16 Ohio State No. 18 Wisconsin and No. 25 Michigan — all teams that qualified for NCAAs in 2022 — each brought multiple runners from their championship lineups to this race. The ‘Cats were no different as Earl Hessler and Bartolotto toed the line. Earl led the way with an 18:03 5K which marked her first cross country race of that distance since she was in high school according to TFRRS. That was good enough for third place overall putting her within six seconds of reigning Big Ten individual champion Addie Engel of OSU. Bartolotto came in fifth as she finished 12 seconds after her junior teammate. Unsurprisingly Hessler came in next with an 18:20 and a ninth-place finish. But the big shock was Delgado who took the No. 4 spot on the team and 13th place in the race with an 18:30. She even beat some runners from other schools who will likely be key components of their top sevens. Fiona Lenth (18:50) Whitman (18:51) and grad transfer Adele Magaud (19:02) rounded out Northwestern’s scoring.  Northwestern finished with 53 points putting itself in third place out of seven teams narrowly falling behind Michigan and Wisconsin. The result is great but may not mean too much in the long run by itself. Given this was the first race of the season for many runners almost everyone ran far off their personal bests. The biggest example of this was Ohio State’s Danielle Santos who placed fourth at 2022 Big Tens and defeated Rachel McCardell but came 30th in Madison with a much weaker field. No one is training for this race and the postseason meets that teams are gearing their plans toward are still about two months away. Additionally no Big Ten team at the Badger Classic ran its entire top lineup. So what can be taken away? Northwestern’s large 40-point gap over Minnesota is encouraging. The Golden Gophers held a No. 4 preseason ranking in the Midwest Region one spot below the ‘Cats at No. 3. While star sophomore Ali Weimer did not race Minnesota’s No. 2 No. 3 No. 4 and No. 5 runners from its Big Ten Championship top seven did. Not only did Northwestern soundly beat Minnesota: it displayed early signs of top-end talent. Earl and Bartolotto’s top-five finishes speak for themselves even though it was a slow race. Even if Weimer is an individual title contender come November at the Midwest Regional the Wildcats could be in a good position to beat the Gophers if their top two runners can mirror last Saturday’s result when it matters most. Ultimately though it’s difficult to concretely assess Northwestern until its lineup works itself out and races together. Next Saturday could be a great opportunity to do that as the ‘Cats will head east to UVA to take on elite competition at the Virginia Invitational. Because the national meet is set to take place in Charlottesville many of the nation’s best teams will be there to take advantage of a chance to get to know the tough Panorama Farms course. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Durham North Carolina has become a house of horrors. On Saturday afternoon Northwestern (1-2 0-1 B1G) was decimated by Duke (3-0 1-0 ACC) 38-14. The Blue Devils had their way with the Wildcats rushing for 238 yards and five touchdowns. Duke QB Riley Leonard was the star of the game throwing for 215 yards and adding another 97 on the ground. He also added two scores with his legs. Jordan Waters added another 65 yards and two touchdowns for the Blue Devils. For Northwestern Ben Bryant passed for 123 yards a touchdown and an interception. Cam Johnson added 45 yards on five catches. NU started with the ball and after a jet sweep by A.J. Henning picked up nine yards on first down the Wildcats could not pick up the final three feet. On third down Ben Bryant was stuffed at the line of scrimmage on a QB sneak. To make matters worse Hunter Renner shanked a punt for just 22 net yards setting the Blue Devils up near midfield. Duke had no problem moving the ball down the field. Waters was the bell cow of the drive pummeling through multiple Wildcats to pick up a third-down conversion. Just a few plays later Waters busted through the middle as the Blue Devils parted the Red Sea and No. 7 went untouched to the endzone to put DU on the scoreboard first. On the ensuing Wildcats’ drive Northwestern picked up its first fresh set of downs of the day on a seven-yard completion to Johnson but stalled on the ensuing three plays. The ‘Cats punted again and it was another shank by Renner. However the Blue Devils were not able to capitalize on the short field. After picking up a first down Duke found itself a yard short on fourth. Leonard tried to sneak the ball over the line to gain but NU stuffed the gunslinger at the line of scrimmage handing the ball right back to the Wildcats at midfield. NU reached Blue Devil territory on a third down conversion to Bryce Kirtz but the offense stalled once again. Renner on his third attempt finally got hold of one and pinned Duke inside its own 10. On Duke’s ensuing drive the Blue Devils marched right down the field. Multiple 10+ runs and a 34-yard pass to Jalon Calhoun put DU into the red zone and a QB draw by Leonard set the Blue Devils inside the 1-yard line as the first quarter expired. Waters punched it in to expand Duke’s lead to 14-0 less than a minute into the second quarter. The Wildcats’ offense still couldn’t find a rhythm. After a five-yard gain by Cam Porter on first down NU found themselves in a third-and-short scenario. Bryant hit Henning past the line to gain but a big hit knocked the ball out and Northwestern had to punt again. On the ensuing drive it was the Riley Leonard show. No. 13 slipped a free rusher broke through the offensive line and took off running for 33 yards all the way to the edge of the red zone. NU defense was able to hold Duke and force the Blue Devils to settle for three pushing the lead to 17-0. Northwestern finally started to move the ball on offense. Bryant kept the drive alive with a third-down conversion to Johnson and Henning picked up another fresh set of downs on a jet sweep. Joseph Himon added another two first downs. On the edge of the red zone Bryant ripped a dart to Bryce Kirtz for another third-down conversion. Two plays later No. 2 found a wide-open Henning to put the Wildcats on the board and cut Duke’s lead 17-7. The scoring drive was 15 plays 73 yards and 8:26. With just 34 seconds on the clock Leonard gave the ‘Cats a scare with a 24-yard strike to Calhoun which set up Duke at midfield. However an Anto Saka sack off the edge kept the Blue Devils at bay keeping the game at 17-7 going into halftime. Out of the break Duke’s offense picked up right where they left off in the first half. Leonard led the Blue Devils right down the field including two 20+ yards completions. On the edge of the red zone Leonard swung a screen over to Jordan Moore who took it all the way inside the five. No. 13 would cap off the drive with a touchdown and Duke would jump back out to a 17-point lead. On the ensuing possession Porter picked up 25 yards on the ground but Northwestern stalled at midfield bringing the punting unit out on the field once again.  As soon as Duke got the ball it went right back down the field. Leonard with a defender draped around his legs somehow launched a 28 pass to Calhoun to continue the drive. The Blue Devils ran the ball down NU’s throat and Leonard scampered in for his second TD on the ground putting the nail in the coffin for the game with a 31-7 Duke lead. On the ensuing Northwestern possession the ‘Cats moved the ball down the field aided by a Duke unsportsmanlike penalty and a fourth down conversion to Johnson kept the drive alive and Bryce Kirtz hauled in a 20-yard reception to put the Wildcats deep into the red zone. Despite threatening Northwestern was unable to find the endzone and came away empty-handed. Duke punted on its next drive; however Bryant gave it right back with an interception on fourth down deep in Northwestern territory. The Blue Devils playing with their second string capitalized on the turnover. Peyton Jones waltzed into the end zone untouched as Duke piled on to make it a 38-7 game. Both teams pulled their starters and Brendan Sullivan led NU down the field and found his way into the end zone to close the game. Duke took one final knee to send the Wildcats packing 38-14. Northwestern will be back in action next Saturday night taking on Minnesota at Ryan Field at 6:30 p.m CT.

Not a whole lot this week. Share this story After a slow start last week Northwestern scored 31 straight points to capture a much-needed home-opening victory against UTEP. Coming into this one the team was hoping for that momentum to carry over into this week’s matchup against a ranked Duke squad. Unfortunately that wasn’t the case and the Wildcats took a hard tumble back to earth. Here’s what we learned from the contest. Stock Up A.J. Henning Good things happen when Henning touches the ball. Coming into this game No. 8 was averaging 10 yards per reception on six catches and six yards per carry on six carries with a rushing touchdown. This week he added a receiving touchdown and 41 total yards to go along with it and continued to do what he’s done so far this season which is move the ball downfield with every touch. Unfortunately the offense as a whole has left a lot to be desired which has kept Henning from getting as many touches as he probably should (although this week was slightly better in that regard). With that being said he has done what could with the opportunities he has received and that’s enough for his stock to be going in the right direction. Bryce Gallagher Gallagher did what Gallagher usually does. After a quiet game last weekend in this department he was back playing his usual type of game this week appearing everywhere on the field and collecting tackles at will. He had 13 tackles on the afternoon 1.5 of which that went for a loss. It didn’t translate to many stops on the field but it was one bright spot for an otherwise porous defensive effort. Overall it was a solid performance from the senior linebacker.  Discipline Aside from an offsetting unsportsmanlike conduct call early in the third quarter the Wildcats played a pretty clean game all things considered. They played penalty-free football and they also did a very good job at not giving the ball away (even if it didn’t lead to more scoring opportunities). While it’s disheartening to see this team play so poorly it is somewhat encouraging to see the team not making a rash of mental errors and to not be allowing them to beat themselves. They do say that football is all about the little things right? Honorable Mentions: Brendan Sullivan Cam Johnson fourth-down defense good experience against good teams? Stock Down Ben Bryant Bryant finds himself back on the stock report this week after his appearance last week. Unfortunately his stock is trending back in the wrong direction this time. He has failed to look comfortable in this offense through the first three games of the season and this week’s stat line ultimately backs up that sentiment. After struggling though most of the game to keep his completion percentage above 50% he wrapped up his poor performance with an interception after the game had already been decided. He ended the day 17-for-34 for 123 yards through the air with one touchdown and one interception. It’s been an unfortunate start to his Northwestern tenure after proving to be a solid quarterback in both his stops at Eastern Michigan and last year at Cincinnati and the continued struggles land him on the wrong side of the stock report this week. Hunter Renner There’s not much to say here other than to acknowledge how critical it is to have a capable punting unit when you’re stuck playing the field position battle all game long. To Renner’s credit the second half was much better than the first half including his ability to execute a perfect 46-yard punt that pinned the Blue Devils inside their own 10-yard line in the third quarter. Unfortunately a 22-yard punt followed by a 29-yard punt early in the first half that resulted in excellent field position for the Duke offense more than overshadowed that and proved once more that there is plenty of work to be done to shore up the special teams unit on this team. Rushing defense Where do you start with this one? Whether it be the poor tackling or the inability to generate push on the defensive line Northwestern had absolutely no answer for the Duke rushing attack. Aside from an early fourth-down stop on fourth and short early in the first half there weren’t many positive signs on this front. The Blue Devils ran the ball at will to the tune of 268 yards and five touchdowns. This is perhaps among the most troubling signs as the Wildcats move closer to Big Ten play as it is very well-known how stout the rushing attacks are within the conference. If this doesn’t get cleaned up and quick then this season might feel even longer than the fans previously thought.

Share this story Another year another edition of the Nerd Bowl. Northwestern heads to Durham North Carolina to face a revamped (and ranked) Duke team led by star quarterback Riley Leonard. While the ‘Cats won handily against UTEP last Saturday the staff isn’t riding that wave of optimism today. Iggy Dowling: Duke 27 Northwestern 6   The Blue Devils are too good defensively and Northwestern’s offensive line remains unproven against Power Five competition despite a really nice day last week. It’s as simple as that. Bradley Locker: Duke 35 Northwestern 17 In the last two meetings with the Blue Devils Northwestern has been down 21+ points within the first minute of the second quarter. With the Wildcats’ defense struggling out of the gate in its first two games I don’t foresee much changing in that department. The ‘Cats are outmatched by a Duke team that’s got legitimate ACC title aspirations dropping their fifth in a row to their Durham academic foes. David Gold: Duke 31 Northwestern 24 I can’t explain why but the Wildcats always seem to play the Blue Devils close. At the end of the day I think Duke’s offense is just too much for NU to handle. Riley Leonard is one of the best QBs in college football and will pick apart the ‘Cats if they can’t get pressure. If it turns into a shootout I think Northwestern won’t keep up and will fall back to under .500. Natalie Wells: Duke 31 Northwestern 9 Last week’s drubbing of UTEP was truly amazing to watch. It almost made up for the pain and sorrow that NU fans have endured in these last two seasons. But like everything in sports what goes up must come down. The ‘Cats won’t be able to run at will against Duke’s front seven like they did against the Miners. Forcing Ben Bryant to throw 25 passes is not a recipe for success. The Wildcats will fall back to earth in Durham. Ascher Levin: Duke 27 Northwestern 14 Following its first win in more than a year Northwestern is coming into this game against Duke with confidence. While it was a great second half where Northwestern outscored UTEP 31-0 Duke is a much tougher opponent. The Blue Devils’ defense is their strength and they have held Clemson and Lafayette to seven points in their first two games. Northwestern’s offense is going to have to run the ball well if it wants to sustain drives and score points. On the defensive side the Wildcats have to stop the quarterback run. Duke’s quarterback Riley Leonard ran for 699 yards and 13 touchdowns last year and Northwestern has to have defenders in position to handle the zone read whenever Duke runs the ball. Duke is the best team that Northwestern has faced in the first three weeks and the Blue Devils’ run game and great defense will prove to be too much for the Wildcats. John Olsen: Duke 38 Northwestern 0 The best part about this game is it’s on ACC Network so no one can (legally) see the beatdown this team is about to endure.  Ashleigh Provoost: Duke 28 Northwestern 7 Northwestern’s win last week showed a lot of promise. In an unbelievable turn of events the ‘Cats put up 38 points forced multiple turnovers and everything seemed to be finally coming together… but that was against UTEP. Duke has been in unbelievable form lately — now No. 21 in the AP Poll — and after witnessing Duke knock Clemson down 16 spots with a win that saw students storming the field I can’t see any reality where Northwestern takes this one. I think the only thing helping us put up one score is that lingering post-win confidence from last week. Noah Poser: Duke 31 Northwestern 15 Good teams win GREAT teams cover; that’s the saying right? Let’s be honest with ourselves on this one. Duke is a really good football team and this game isn’t likely to be close. On the bright side I do see Northwestern covering the spread as it stands right now at Duke -17. Now this game isn’t a total lost cause because there is one glaring weakness for the Blue Devils that the Wildcats could look to exploit. Duke ranks 105th in the FBS in rushing defense allowing 169.5 rushing yards per game. After a weak start on the ground against Rutgers Northwestern turned it around last week rushing for 184 yards as it beat UTEP. If the Wildcats can keep that up and take advantage of what looks to be a suspect rushing defense for the Blue Devils then there is a chance (albeit a slim one) that they pull of the upset. Ultimately as I said before the game won’t end up being close because it’s doubtful that the Wildcats actually manage to dominate on the ground. Duke wins. Patrick Winograd: Duke 34 Northwestern 17 I was encouraged enough by the offensive outbreak against UTEP that I am choosing to believe this team can put up an okay performance offensively. However it would be totally irresponsible to assume that a team that scored 28 points against Clemson (albeit aided by three Clemson turnovers) and has an NFL quarterback would get any less than 30 against Northwestern. I do think that Northwestern’s defense has been more solid than people have given the Wildcats credit for but that’s not enough to keep this game super close. It will be a comfortable win for Duke but I am keeping my fingers crossed and hoping Northwestern can keep it within a reasonable margin. Brendan Preisman: Duke 31 Northwestern 14 So far this season Northwestern’s fate has been determined in the trenches. If their offensive line can get traction the ‘Cats will pile up nearly 200 rushing yards like they did in their dismantling of UTEP. If the line can’t get traction then the rushing total may be far closer to two than 200 (22 carries for twelve total yards against Rutgers should prove that). It’s a similar story on the defensive line: two tackles for loss against Rutgers nine against UTEP. Unfortunately this week the Wildcats face a squad with much better line play. Duke averages six yards per carry has tallied 12 tackles for loss and sacked the opposing quarterback four times while not allowing their quarterback to be tackled behind the line of scrimmage a single time this season. It’s going to be a war decided in the trenches but Duke’s guns are much more formidable than Northwestern’s. Jake Mozarsky: Duke 27 Northwestern 13 I think this game is closer than Vegas indicates but the Duke defense has been one of the top in the country and has a lot of stars. I do think Northwestern’s defense can keep it in the game or keep the score closer but Mike Elko has his team fresh off nine wins on a high and should take care of business today.

Share this story Riley Leonard ran rampant Jordan Waters worked wonders and the Blue Devils bedeviled Northwestern both on the ground and through the air with nearly 500 yards of total offense.  The better team did what it was supposed to do: win in dominant fashion. You saw it I saw it everyone saw it. It’s a tale that was told two weeks ago in Piscataway New Jersey and chances are it’ll be retold many of these next few Saturdays like Mister Rogers drilling fundamental life lessons into kids’ heads. It’s not a cause for panic nor is it something to be satisfied about; it’s merely a tough reality.  What is one supposed to do with that information? Northwestern’s approach has remained constant since July: chug forward and try to leave bleakness behind. “We have to detach from the result identify the areas that we need to continue to improve upon” head coach David Braun said after the loss. “And again it’s really easy to sit back and point a finger but specifically in regards to this week that finger’s coming right back at me.” Accountability is great and Braun has displayed that quality repeatedly. Unfortunately it’s merely a hint of positivity for the long-term future and it hasn’t yet reflected itself on the scoreboard against a Power Five opponent. Yet considering Northwestern is wandering through the desert right now subtleties like that one or Anto Saka’s pass-rushing breakout are engines toward progress.  There’s a popular saying that goes “Don’t let the world pass you by.” That too is a small engine toward progress. The NU fans who aren’t clicking “sim to next season” in their heads might be maintaining the optimism that investing themselves in the struggles of 2023 will serve as somewhat of a vehicle toward the unbridled joy of future success. When a freight train swiftly runs over that vehicle — or smoothly breezes by it as Duke’s rushers were doing to Northwestern tacklers — it’s especially tough to acknowledge the tiny vehicle’s presence. To that I counter with the statement “Don’t let the train pass you by.”  Literally it’s paradoxical. Figuratively sometimes the only thing to do in a state like Northwestern’s is to observe opponents’ rebuilding blueprints and ponder how to follow them. Even as the royal blue train speeds away take a good look at it. Duke and NU have been compared so much as football programs and universities that connecting the two borders on cliche. But it’s intriguing to consider that the Wildcats will leave Durham at the lowest point they’ve been in during the recent renewal of this series while the Blue Devils might end up flying as high as ever.  You look at Leonard who came to Duke as a three-star recruit in 2021 after the team suffered through the worst season of David Cutcliffe’s tenure. 247 Sports slotted him as the 58th-best quarterback in that class and Brendan Sullivan was 55th. Two years later Leonard has shot up NFL Draft boards and sliced his way toward becoming one of college football’s premier dual-threats. More importantly he’s the centerpiece of a six-win turnaround that could balloon even higher. You look at Mike Elko the former defensive coordinator who filled Cutcliffe’s shoes in 2022 and immediately pulled out a nine-win season. In less than two years he could spearhead a rebuild that ends up with Duke attaining its highest AP ranking in over 50 years. You look at the Duke crowd which demonstrated the limiting reality of being an academically elite institution with its sparseness on Saturday while also flashing its potential for capturing magic just 12 days earlier. Even in a revamped Big Ten Northwestern can become Duke or at least get close. It probably won’t happen anytime soon but it’s not impossible. This isn’t anything groundbreaking; it’s been said often. Yet in detaching oneself from another beatdown with more projected to come soon sometimes all there is to do is dwell on that possibility and hope for better days ahead. And ultimately ramp up the work to mirror that paragon in the face of demoralizing results.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Unfortunately for those fans the start of this season has left fans doubting that the level of success for Northwestern football will be very high this year. While that has some feeling disappointed not all hope is lost in this fall sports season due to high levels of play being shown by a few of the other Wildcats’ teams that have each of them ranked as top-20 teams in the nation. Among those teams are field hockey as well as the men’s and women’s soccer teams. This week we take a deeper look at each of these squads and showcase what has led to their success thus far starting with field hockey. Field hockey - National Ranking No. 3 (6-1) Key Wins- No. 5 Duke No. 15 Boston College No. 19 UMass No. 20 Indiana  Routinely one of the top programs in the nation over the past four years the program that has finished as national champions and national runner-ups the past two seasons is proving once again that they are a threat for the title. After dropping their first match of the season to Louisville (now ranked No. 1 in the nation) the Wildcats have won their last six outings four of which having been against other ranked programs including capturing a tough top-5 win against another national title contender in Duke.  Even more impressive is how convincing these wins against ranked opponents have been beating UMass and Indiana by a combined score of 8-0 in the past two games. If you stretch it back even further the team has outscored their opponents 13-0 in their last four contests behind the strength of stellar defensive play. The team is rounding into form at the perfect time as plenty of top teams await Northwestern in Big Ten play as well as a couple of tough games against Penn and Princeton in non-conference play. Despite the tough schedule all early returns suggest that the Wildcats should be able to weather that storm so if you’re looking to root for a team with championship aspirations this squad is the one for you. Women’s Soccer- National Ranking No. 18 (6-0-2) Key Wins - at Virginia Tech Men’s Soccer- National Ranking No. 19 (6-0-1) Key Wins - vs. UIC These two teams have followed similar paths this season to their respective top-20 rankings so we’re going to take a look at them side-by-side. For starters let’s look at the season of the women’s soccer team. While not a perennial contender like the field hockey program the team took a huge leap last season making it all the way to The Round of 16 in the NCAA Tournament. This season the ‘Cats are starting to show that it was no fluke. Through eight matches this season they are unbeaten. Northwestern’s most recent win a tight match against Virginia Tech in a tough road environment only further proves that the team is to be taken seriously this season. What makes this success even more interesting is that the Wildcats have been winning these games using something of a by-committee approach. The squad has four players with four or more goals this season and six players with multiple goals led by senior forward Ella Hase with six. The ability to have multiple key players will allow for a certain level of consistency moving forward throughout the season. On the other side of things you have the men’s soccer team. From a team routinely at the top to a team on the upswing and finally arriving at a team that has come seemingly out of nowhere the Northwestern men’s soccer team has shocked everybody to make a rare appearance in the national rankings. The men’s soccer team hasn’t made the NCAA Tournament since 2014 and hasn’t won a game in the tournament since 2013 but the Wildcats are trying to change that this season after a hot start that has seen them go unbeaten in their first seven matches. They have gotten to this point by doing what good teams do: simply taking care of opponents that they should beat. Northwestern does have a quality win against a strong UIC squad but in the rest of their wins the team has proven that they can take care of business in games that maybe wouldn’t have been wins in past seasons. That should give them plenty of confidence moving forward into Big Ten play. Speaking of conference play that’s where both of these teams will be starting this upcoming week. When you compare expectations to where they were at the start of the season they’re much higher now than they were then. Of course the Big Ten is loaded with quality teams on both sides of the sport but doubt these groups of Wildcats at your own peril. Keep an eye out All in all it’s a good time to be a Northwestern sports fan even if football has you down. While there is still hope that the football team turns it around for a successful season these other teams are proving that they have you covered if you need your fix of winning. So make sure to keep a close eye on these teams to see if the field hockey team can fulfill the goal of another national title and to see if the men’s and women’s soccer teams can prove to be true contenders for the Big Ten crown.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story With Week Three in the rearview mirror most Big Ten schools have wrapped up non-conference play and are now looking ahead to the Big Ten slate. At this point in the season it’s starting to become clear who the top contenders are and which other teams are going to be left fighting to reach bowl eligibility. Looking at you Big Ten West. But with that being said welcome back to another edition of Around the Big Ten. Big Ten East > Big Ten West…again It seems that this becomes a talking point every season but it looks like it’s proving to be true once more. Ever since the divisions shifted back in 2014 with addition of Maryland and Rutgers to the conference the state of competitive balance between the two conferences has been uneven. This season it has long been determined that the top three teams in the conference are all in the east in Michigan Ohio State and Penn State. Unfortunately it looks like they might have the fifth and sixth-best teams as well in Maryland and Rutgers.  While Iowa who happens to be the only other Big Ten program ranked in the AP Top 25 besides the Big Three is looking like a strong contender in the West especially after the offense showed up in a 41-10 win over Western Michigan on Saturday there doesn’t seem to be much competition for them. Minnesota just got trounced by No. 17 North Carolina 31-13 this past weekend. Wisconsin seemed somewhat competitive against a top-25 school in Washington State a couple of weeks ago so it might be the biggest challenger to Iowa by default. The rest of the schools in the West already have two losses and are all struggling with quarterback questions that will likely take them out of contention. Regardless judging from early season results whoever comes out of the west is due for a rude awakening in the Big Ten Championship once again. No longer in a Rut(gers) Speaking of the Big Ten East being the superior division that fact is supported by the Scarlet Knights reaching Week Four with an unblemished record. While that’s likely to change this weekend after a road date with Michigan (although they do usually play the Wolverines very close) it feels important to acknowledge the strides that this program has made under Greg Schiano. It’s 3-0 this season after a 35-16 win at home against Virginia Tech on Saturday. Rutgers also sits at 1-0 in conference play after the season-opening win over Northwestern. On top of that the Knights look to be in a position where a bowl game is well in sight despite a murderer’s row stretch of four games to end the season. There’s obviously some concerns to hash out moving forward such as a passing offense that ranks 125th in the nation but for now it’s nothing but good times in Piscataway. Nebraska is back! (for this week at least) The good times extend to Lincoln after this weekend as the Cornhuskers became the final Big Ten team to enter the win column this season with a 35-11 win at home over Northern Illinois. The victory marked the first under new head coach Matt Rhule. It also marked the first win as the starting quarterback for sophomore Heinrich Haarberg who looked like a marked improvement at the quarterback position for Nebraska. He went 14-for-24 for 158 yards passing and two touchdowns adding 98 yards rushing with a touchdown on the ground. It is expected that Haarberg will once again be the starting quarterback this upcoming week in the team’s home game against Louisiana Tech and it will be a good opportunity for him and the offense to polish things up before a big home game against the Michigan Wolverines the following week. Big Ten pitching a shutout against the MAC? The Big Ten is 7-0 against the MAC this season after Michigan took care of business against Bowling Green in its Saturday night game in the Big House this past weekend by a score of 31-6. At first glance that may not seem very significant for two reasons. One: in all of those matchups the Big Ten team was favored. Secondly the Big Ten is supposed to be a significantly stronger conference in general. However a very important streak is on the cusp of being broken and that streak will be on the line when Akron travels to take on Indiana this upcoming Saturday night. Seemingly unknown to most the MAC has a 16-year streak (COVID year not included) of having at least one of its programs beating a Big Ten opponent in football dating all the way back to Oct. 14 2006 when Ohio upset Illinois on a last-second field goal. So far the Big Ten has managed to dodge those bullets and seems relatively safe in being able to put an end to the MAC’s run due to the state of Akron football but you never know with this conference rivalry. Akron at Indiana is the game to watch next weekend… well except for this next one. Non-existent big wins in non-conference play There’s a pretty big game on the docket this weekend for those who haven’t heard. No. 5 Ohio State travels to South Bend to take on No. 9 Notre Dame in South Bend Saturday night fresh off of a 63-10 trouncing of Western Kentucky. The game is not only big for Ohio State and its college football playoff chances but it is also big for the entire Big Ten. The conference hasn’t made a lot of noise in non-conference play up to this point. Save for a Penn State win over a pretty average West Virginia squad in Week One the results — and the level of competition — have been underwhelming across the league. While some may groan at the idea of “rooting for the conference” this may be one of those occasions where it’s warranted as it’s important for one of the top teams in the Big Ten to look the part for really the first time in 2023.

Share this story After a great showing in the Northeast Invitational that helped push the ‘Cats above .500 and a road win at Fairfield it seemed highly likely the team would hit a wall after garnering their longest winning streak since last October. While that wall was hit Northwestern was still able to split their matches with UIC and Yale back at Welsh-Ryan Arena. The 1-1 week provides a lot to celebrate as the Wildcats head into conference play but also showed some cracks the team can’t afford to leave exposed for teams like Wisconsin and Nebraska.  Game One: UIC September 13 In the Wildcats’ first home game in 12 days the team came out firing. Ellee Stinson tallied a pair of aces as Northwestern jumped out to an 8-0 lead over UIC. The Flames quickly caught fire though and rallied to take an 11-10 edge. After some back and forth action Northwestern built a comfortable cushion to pull away and take the first set 25-20. The second set looked a lot like the first. Once again Northwestern took an early lead but a UIC run enabled them to take an 11-10 advantage. With the score tied at 13 Julia Sangiacomo began taking over the set. She was responsible for one kill in a 3-0 run that stretched the lead to 16-13 and a powerful spike set the tone for a 5-1 run to close the door on the Flames. Northwestern took the second set 25-18 putting themselves one set away from victory. At first it seemed like the third set would get the ‘Cats that victory. Northwestern built leads of 5-0 and 11-5 early but UIC responded quickly to make it 11-10. After another Wildcat run to push the lead to 19-15 behind more Sangiacomo spikes it seemed as though the game would end quickly. Someone forgot to tell UIC that though as the Flames managed to take a slim 22-21 lead. In a set full of comebacks Northwestern was unable to mount one of its own and fell 23-25. The comeback by the visitors took a lot of air out of Welsh-Ryan Arena as evidenced by the fourth set. UIC jumped all over the Wildcats to take leads of 4-0 and 8-5 after which Northwestern would never get closer than two points. The Flames were on fire throughout the set tying the match at two sets apiece thanks to a 25-10 dismantling of Northwestern. In the fifth set the couple of Chicago-based combatants traded blows in a winner-take-all set. Graduate transfer Maddy Chinn earned her 18th kill of the night (a career best) to help the ‘Cats take a 7-6 lead. However UIC would once again showcase their resilience in building an 11-8 lead. One last slam from Sangiacomo cut the deficit to a pair but once again Northwestern was unable to mount a comeback. UIC took the set 15-11 and earned a stunning comeback victory to move to 8-3.  The Wildcats fell to 5-4 but it was no fault of Chinn’s whose 18 kills led the team. Alexa Rousseau put up a season-high 50 assists to move into seventh on the all-time Northwestern board and Stinson added a career-high four aces. The main issue for the Wildcats was service returns as they allowed UIC to total 10 aces. Game Two: Yale September 15 In a battle of academic powerhouses Northwestern was the powerhouse on the volleyball court. The Wildcats wasted no time jumping all over the Bulldogs building a 9-4 lead in the first set. Yale fought back but unlike two days previously Northwestern weathered the storm. Thanks to Rousseau the ‘Cats escaped a 13-13 tie to go up 17-13. Once again Yale knotted things up and once again Northwestern was forced to respond. This time it was Leilani Dodson who stepped up garnering a kill and a block in the final three points of the set to push Northwestern to a 25-22 first set victory. In the second set it was Yale who went out ahead early but Northwestern quickly made up the game. After tying the game at 6-6 the Wildcats went on a 4-0 run sparked by powerful spikes from Kathryn Randorf. The run only got better from there with the lead reaching 16-9 then 22-15. Sangiacomo earned her third kill of the set to close out a 25-19 Wildcat victory. Much like two days prior Northwestern had a 2-0 lead heading into the third set. This time though the ‘Cats finished the job. The third set was tight at first with the teams deadlocked at 10 when first year Gigi Navarette stepped to the service line. Behind some spectacular offense including Dodson once again stepping up with a clutch kill the Wildcats built a 16-10 lead. That 6-0 run eventually turned into a 15-3 run as Northwestern pulled away to win the clinching set by a wide margin of 25-13. Both Sangiacomo and Dodson reached double-digit kills in the match and Dodson also added a pair of blocks. Ellee Stinson was hugely active on the defensive side garnering 16 digs and Rousseau marked her eighth game of 30 or more assists. Northwestern totaled an attacking percentage of .345 in the match and tallied 41 digs in the contest as well.  The Wildcats’ next challenge is Big Ten play which will be unlike anything the team has dealt with so far this year. After going 1-1 in their non-conference ranked matchups the ‘Cats will be thrown into the fire immediately as conference play begins.

Share this story Another weekend of Northwestern football has come and gone. Even with tempered expectations Saturday’s 38-14 loss to Duke was disappointing on the heels of a celebratory home win against UTEP a week prior. Unlike Tim Robbins’ character in “Bull Durham” Northwestern’s trip to Durham did not unlock untapped potential or prove the team to be worthy of a higher level of competition. Instead in this overextended metaphor centered around a 1988 baseball romantic comedy the ‘Cats were more akin to Kevin Costner’s character Crash Davis left dejected and forced to wonder if the opposing talent was too much to keep up with.  Anyways that’s enough of the wrong sport (with a final shoutout to Susan Sarandon). Here are five things we learned from Northwestern’s defeat in Durham: Slow starts are becoming a worrying trend The Wildcats just keep finding themselves digging out of self-made holes. In all three games this season the ‘Cats have surrendered opening drive touchdowns quickly falling into seven-point deficits. These sleepy starts have extended longer than the opening drive. Through three contests Northwestern has been outscored 41-14 in first halves. In the UTEP game the team was able to overcome this with an unforgettable 31-point second half but Northwestern does not have the fortune of playing the Miners every week. To compete in Big Ten play the Wildcats will have to straighten out their woes in the opening minutes especially on the defensive side of the ball. The team has improved on the money downs Coaches will tell you that games are won and lost on third and fourth downs. It’s not a universal truth that the team with the higher third down success rate will go on to win but it’s usually a good indicator. On Saturday Northwestern’s offense converted nine of 17 third down attempts (52.9%) including one touchdown drive in the second quarter that featured three of such plays. Against a Duke defense that is no slouch (check out the Clemson game) this is an encouraging trend. Unlike last year when a third-and-long felt like a death sentence for a drive this year’s squad makes those conversions feel far more attainable. Although on the other side of the ball Duke also converted over 50% of its third downs (5-for-9) the defense did get a clutch stop on a fourth-and-one marking their third fourth-down stuff in the past two weeks.  Chunk plays will make or break the Wildcats There is something to be said about having an offense that can dink-and-dunk its way down the field mixing runs and passes to eat clock and demoralize a defense. But building an offense around that mindset is not sustainable — maybe you get one of those drives a game but other than that you’re facing an uphill battle to remain on schedule and never get behind the chains. In other words any successful offense needs big plays to work. On Saturday Northwestern had just two plays that accumulated 15 or more yards one of which came in garbage time once the game was already out of hand. Duke on the other hand had 12 such plays totaling 284 yards total. These came via ground and air with Northwestern’s defense struggling to find any way to stop the Blue Devil offense. According to StatBroadcast Northwestern was 0-for-6 on passes that traveled 15 or more yards downfield bringing its season total to 3-of-20 on these deep throws. This is the key to unlocking the offense which will be crucial heading into conference play. Having patience with Ben Bryant may be rewarding I’m not trying to zag here but I came away from Saturday feeling more encouraged than not from Ben Bryant’s performance. The interception was ugly but Bryant played generally well on the road against a good team even if the box score doesn’t show it. I mentioned above the team’s improvement on third downs and that is in large part thanks to Bryant’s decisiveness and accuracy which were on display a few times on Saturday afternoon.  Bryant was surgical attacking the outside parts of the field on timing routes. On mid-range passing concepts Bryant showed anticipation and poise zipping the ball in to complete 8-of-11 passes on outside-the-hash throws between five and 14 yards. Those eight completions led to 92 yards almost 75% of Bryant’s total aerial production on the day. It might be easy to say that Brendan Sullivan deserves a chance to start and although Sully has been the undisputed king of meaningless fourth-quarter football this year continued faith in Bryant should pan out in the long-run. Riley Leonard is the real deal Yes this is a Northwestern site but we’re all college football fans here right? As frustrating as it was to watch unfold in real time with a few days of separation it’s hard not to be impressed with Duke’s quarterback and see why NFL scouts are projecting him to make the jump. Leonard picked apart a quality Northwestern secondary completing 13 of his first 15 passes. Leonard finished with 219 passing yards on the day before he was relieved of his duties in the fourth but where the Blue Devil did most of his damage was on the ground where he added 97 yards and two scores. On several occasions the signal-caller turned would-be sacks into positive gains that disheartened the Wildcat defense. I mean seriously look at this ridiculousness: Riley Leonard entered beast mode  pic.twitter.com/zeTP7DRJs0 In a draft class loaded with quarterbacks Leonard has entered his name into the conversation. This whole Duke squad is legit and it has a real chance to compete in the ACC this season. Most likely Leonard is the best quarterback the ‘Cats will face all season and although that doesn’t excuse the loss or giving up 38 points it serves as a learning opportunity. If nothing else you can be sure you’ll see a few defenders wearing purple in the highlight package ESPN shows whenever Leonard gets drafted into the pros. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After a 38-14 loss against No. 18 Duke Northwestern heads home to begin Big Ten West play against Minnesota. In his weekly press conference head coach David Braun spoke about what he saw on Saturday and some of his thoughts on the coming one. Opening statement: “Had an opportunity to come in this morning after an off-day yesterday put the Duke game to rest. Plenty to learn from everyone included starting with me. Did not go down to Durham and play our best football I think that was very apparent. It’s something that we used as a growth opportunity this morning. Certainly a great deal of credit to that program. They’ve done an exceptional job. They’re playing really well on both offense and defense. Quarterback is a high-end player. There’s reason for us as a program to identify the things that we need to get better at while staying very optimistic that when we do get clicking on all cylinders we have an opportunity to compete with anyone.  “Shifting into Big Ten West football which this group is really excited about. Returning to Ryan Field against a very very very physical opponent that knows what it takes to win in the Big Ten West. Coach [P.J.] Fleck and his staff have done a tremendous job in his time there of really building the program and building an identity on both sides of the football that complements one another. There’s no doubt in my mind that there’s quite a challenge in front of us but it will certainly embody what Big Ten football is all about what Big Ten West football is all about. Our guys are excited our staff is excited to be transitioning into Minnesota prep. The guys will be back this afternoon for some install meetings a brief practice then transition into our typical Tuesday. On to Minnesota.” On whether he saw improvement against Duke compared to the loss against Rutgers: “I think I’d be hard-pressed to say that... I’ve seen improvement since Rutgers day in and day out. In terms of the performance and the way that we performed in that isolated 60 minutes down in Durham I don’t know if I can say that. It wasn’t our best when we pride ourselves on fundamentals and technique and our demeanor of play that did not show up on Saturday. Opportunity for us to own that challenge the group [and] challenge myself to be better moving forward. There’s no doubt that in our two opportunities to play on the road so far this year we have not started fast we have not played well collectively as a group. Excited to be back at Ryan Field but regardless of where we’re playing whether we’re at home or on the road we need to perform at a higher level than we did on Saturday.” On how to improve early-down run defense against Minnesota: “That’s a great question. It sounds very cliche but it all starts off with our fundamentals and technique. We need to create knockback at the line of scrimmage we need to define our gaps up front we need to violently get off of blocks we need to understand the fit structure that we’re playing with and play with great leverage and we need to tackle well. It’s easy to say all those things not always easy to do especially against a very well-coached quality opponent like Minnesota.  “As a staff starting with myself we need to do a good job of putting a plan in place that allows our guys to play really fast to change the picture up on their offensive line their running backs and their quarterback. And collectively we need to play complementary football we need to trust all four quarters and understand whether or not we start fast or don’t start fast — we didn’t start fast against UTEP but we played a full four quarters — we need to trust that over the course of four quarters we’re gonna find ways to get a lead. At the end of the day Minnesota when they’re ahead is at their best. They are going to milk the clock they’re going to control the football they’re going to stay committed to the run game. We need to start early we need find ways to get them behind the chains and force them to become one-dimensional and drop back and throw the football. They have the ability to do [that] at a high level as well but we have to find a way to get these guys out of their comfort zone because when they’re running the ball and leaning into their play-action they’re a dangerous outfit.” On the significance of A.J. Henning and Coco Azema combining for four kick returns against Duke: “I think part of it’s looking for a spark I think part of it is just the belief in that unit starting with the guys that we have back there as returners between A.J. Henning and Coco [Azema]. Both guys have the ability to do some really good things with the ball in their hands. We’re close. Some of those returns a lot of good things are going on we’re getting the ball out to the 30 and we’re a block away from really springing one and flipping the field and giving our offense some advantageous field position. But it really comes back to a belief in the returners a belief in the entire unit and looking for a spark.” On practice adjustments to improve tackling and how much he attributes tackling struggles against Duke to its talent vs. Northwestern’s mistakes: “You’re always evaluating how you’re practicing. You’re always willing to be honest with yourself and look to potentially change. I feel like some of those fundamentals in tackling have shown up in a positive light earlier on in the season. Just because a few missed tackles showed up on film against a really quality opponent you don’t want to hit the panic button. We’re going to carve out plenty of time for individual our position coaches do an incredible job of emphasizing tackling. I think it’s a great opportunity for us collectively as a staff and as a program to really hold ourselves accountable in terms of not only the way we’re practicing in [individual drills] but what type of position are we getting when we finish on the ball-carrier in those practice settings even against scouts? Are we tagging off are we getting in a great position where we can get a good thud? Those are things that I know our leadership and the guys within our locker room that do a great job of holding everyone accountable are gonna certainly make sure that they’re emphasizing [that] this week.” Evaluating the offensive line and tight ends against Duke: “There were moments of production and process where it was exactly what we were looking for. Moving the line of scrimmage moving the point of attack staying glued to blocks through the whistle. Cam [Porter] again in the run game showed the ability to be really efficient and explosive at times tough to take down. But there were moments against a really quality defense and a really quality defensive line where the standard that we expect out of that group wasn’t met. And they know that. They’re well-coached behind Coach [Kurt] Anderson and Coach [Jeff] Genyk. It’s a group we need to continue to lean on. There continued to be flashes on Saturday of guys straining with great effort especially out on the perimeter. Collectively as a group we just need to consistently put that together play after play for a full 60 minutes. Reason to be encouraged but we’re still chasing the standard.” Evaluating the punting and punt return units through the first three games: “The punt return unit we need to get going. We’re feet away from springing a big one late. Theran Johnson is giving maximum effort doing a great job straining to find a way to get that thing started. He just needs to take a better angle and use better technique to make sure he doesn’t get called for a defenseless player. But that’s the strain that we’re looking for and you go back and watch the film we are a few feet away a split-second earlier of him showing up and just shielding off that tackler to get A.J. [Henning] out and rolling. “And I would attribute the punting with Hunter [Renner] to just a lapse in consistency. He’s been such a consistent presence and the product that he’s produced has been really consistent in terms of the location his operation time. A couple of punts he’d like to have back but full faith in what he’s able to do. Not only as a punter in terms of his location but also just being a weapon of really discouraging any form of pressure with the operation time he gets the ball out with.” On whether Hunter Renner and Luke Akers offer different strengths as punters and if the team may use them down the line: “That’s a great question. Where we’re at right now through very transparent conversations with both Hunter and Luke we plan on having Hunter be our starting punter throughout the remainder of the season.” On expectations for the stadium atmosphere on Saturday and its effect: “Honestly I don’t know what to expect. But really excited for the opportunity for our guys. To have students back for it to be Wildcat Welcome to have all of the incoming freshmen at Ryan Field along with a great deal more of the rest of the student body. It’s a Big Ten opponent a Big Ten West opponent. If you can’t get charged up for this opportunity you’ve got something wrong with you. So excited for the opportunity that’s in front of our student-athletes.” On balancing his defensive playcalling and head-coaching responsibilities: “It really comes back to delegating responsibility and trusting those that you delegate that responsibility to. With our defensive staff it’s communication right after the drive on potential adjustments getting in front of some pictures and really understanding how our opponent’s trying to attack us. Make any immediate adjustments that need to be made and then revisit with those guys as the series goes in any follow-up conversations that may have been had while I was over with the offense. “We’ve delegated a lot of that responsibility onto the staff. Have unwavering trust in their ability to manage that. It’s a great staff very knowledgeable. I’ve been really impressed with the way they’ve navigated gameday. And the same goes for the head-coaching responsibility. There’s people that I’m leaning on throughout the game talking different scenarios whether it be going for it on fourth down some potential two-point conversations. We’re sitting down 31-7 and you certainly don’t want to be in that scenario but we’re talking about ‘How do we win this game?’ Well at the end of the day it’s still a three-score game. It’s conversations with Coach [Mike] Bajakian of ‘Hey when you go down and score here we’re going for two.’ We only have so many opportunities so many possessions left. That’s something that I’m becoming more and more comfortable with as each game goes by. But it’s definitely a balance and there’s definitely a lot of people including Coach [Skip] Holtz that I’m involving in those conversations just to make sure I’m doing my best to put guys in situations to be successful.” On using 13 personnel (one running back three tight ends) especially during jet sweeps with A.J. Henning: “It’s something I certainly trust that Coach Bajakian and his staff is doing a really good job of self-evaluating. Really after Week Three it’s a great opportunity for all sides of the football to go through some self-scout and identify where we potentially have some tendencies. Football is a game of matchups and matchups with our tight ends in space blocking potential DBs on the perimeter with A.J. Henning with the ball in his hands is a matchup that we like. Credit to that tight end group they’ve done a great job of blocking in space. A.J.’s done a great job of understanding his angles and creating some really efficient plays within the run game. The exciting thing is the complements that can come off those looks. Excited for our tight ends to continue to shine excited for A.J. and others within the skill group within our offense to continue to shine. That’s the fun part when you get into the season is really having an opportunity to study yourself understand how your opponent views you and then start to use that view of you to counteract that and find some wrinkles that hopefully can create some opportunities for explosive plays.” On Anto Saka: “The young man can rush the passer. There’s no doubt about that. We talk about roles within this program and owning your role and not being satisfied with it. None of us want Anto to be satisfied being a third-and-long specialist or a pass-rush specialist. We want Anto to continue to strive to be an every-down guy that becomes unblockable in this league. He’s not there yet but he continues to improve under the mentorship of Coach [Christian] Smith and some of the veteran leadership in that room. Something that he and I have talked about even just a few days after I arrived as I watched his film and started to wrap my head around the skillset that that young man possesses was like ‘Hey bud in terms of your role let’s start off with being someone that can have a huge impact on the quarterback week in and week out. He’s shown the ability to do that. Excited for him to continue to push that element of his game while also being a more consistent first second-down guy for us as well.” On Big Ten West football and the effect of beginning division play on the team this week: “There’s an edge to our team right now and I think that’s more a result of an understanding that we didn’t perform to the level that we expect out of ourselves on Saturday. And there is a level and you’ll get a sense of that in the building this afternoon as they return. A sense of excitement a sense of embarking on Big Ten West play. To me growing up in the area and observing it for a long time it’s football rooted in physicality and fundamentals. It’s football that’s rooted in the complementary football in playing within all three phases. And it’s going to be a knockout drag-out for four quarters and that’s something this team fully has to prepare itself for if we expect to come out with the result that we’re looking for. But Minnesota in recent years has done a tremendous job of embodying that.” On Cam Johnson’s impact on the wide receiver room: “I think there’s just a level of confidence with Cam that’s contagious. Don’t hear him speak much in terms of outwardly over the top it’s just talking with his quarterback talking with the wide receivers encouraging guys. Cam’s a pro in terms of the way he approaches every single practice. He’s a consistent performer in practice. He’s battled just like anyone through fall camp through some dings along the way but continued to practice continued to improve and the production’s showing up which is really exciting to see. But I would say poise and just a level of professionalism. Even as a student-athlete he just approaches his day-in and day-out in a very mature manner.” On speaking to incoming first-years during Wildcat Welcome: “It would’ve gone off much better if I could figure out how to operate the mic to start. So that’s step one. In some ways it was very humbling to have an opportunity to take some time with a group that is absolutely critical to this student-athlete experience. I think the thing that makes Northwestern really special to me as I observe it. It’s a world-class education as part of Big Ten athletics. Whether that be as a student-athlete that we’re recruiting to come here to get their education from Northwestern and play in the Big Ten or it’s a student that’s coming here to study engineering but still wants the opportunity to experience Big Ten athletics I think that’s what makes this place so special. The experience for both our students and our student athletes.  “That freshman class they will play a critical role in home-field advantage opportunities in football for the next four years in basketball for the next four years coming out to lacrosse games field hockey whatever it may be. That experience is something that when it’s done the right way can be really really special. It was a neat opportunity for me to share some time with them and hopefully with some of the other coaches hopefully get across the message of how critical and important and valued their support is for our athletic programs. I hope with another opportunity to do something like that I can put it into better words than I did during my first opportunity. But it was great and the energy in Welsh-Ryan was awesome. I think we have a young freshman group that’s excited to be a part of the Big Ten experience and we’re looking forward to having them in Ryan Field on Saturday.” On expectations for Ben Bryant and evaluating his play: “Expectations out of Ben are for him to perform on Saturdays the way that he practices. What we see in practice is a really dynamic quarterback that is an absolute weapon with his arm talent and in his accuracy that commands the offense. And you’re certainly seeing plenty of that on gameday especially in some of those third-down conversions. But the level of consistency that we see in practice is what needs to show up on gameday moving forward. Ben understands that and gosh it’s not just Ben. The entire team needs to help Ben in that. It’s a lot easier to play quarterback when you’re playing with a lead and there’s balance in the run game and the pass game and you’re up by 10 points. All of us play a huge factor in that. But when it comes to Ben’s play I’ve been really encouraged by some of the things that I’m seeing it’s the level of consistency that we’re looking for moving forward.” On rotating players on defense against Duke: “I think any time you’re dealing with a tempo operation like Duke that’s just going to be something that everyone can become accustomed to. Not only with our defensive line but all levels of our defense of finding ways to play and lean into our depth. But [Mac Uihlein and Robert Fitzgerald] are young men within our program that have earned the opportunity to get on the field and have a positive impact. We see their impact week in and week out at practice and excited for those guys to continue to find opportunities to shine.” \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After a 24-point loss to Duke in Durham Northwestern Football fell to 1-2 on the season. Now the focus for David Braun’s team shifts to Minnesota; the Gophers are coming off of a loss to Duke’s rival North Carolina and heading to Evanston looking for a win. Over the past three years the Wildcats have had no success against Minnesota losing all three games by a combined score of 110-39 and every year the games have gotten less competitive. Northwestern lost 31-3 in Minneapolis last year and 41-14 in Evanston the year before with the Gophers having a ton of success on the ground. Both teams are hoping for a win and there will be many key matchups across the field. Here are a few to look out for: A.J. Henning and Cam Johnson vs Tyler Nubin Henning and Johnson have been Northwestern’s two playmakers in the passing game and this week they face a Minnesota secondary led by Tyler Nubin. Nubin a fifth-year senior is viewed by many as a potential first-round draft pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. He leads a Minnesota defense that is letting up an average of 199.67 passing yards a game so far. Minnesota’s defense is its stronghold and Nubin is a reason why. If Northwestern wants any success in the air it’s going to come through Henning and Johnson. Last week North Carolina slot receiver Nate McCollum destroyed the Minnesota secondary having 15 receptions for 165 yards. The hope is Henning in the slot can also put up big numbers. If not him Johnson needs to. Whoever is matched up with Nubin will have a long day. Athan Kaliakmanis vs the Northwestern secondary The Gophers’ largest defect so far has been their passing game led by Athan Kaliakmanis who so far is averaging nearly 149 yards per game. This is because Kaliakmanis a first-year starter has not been up to par. But at the same time Northwestern saw Kaliakmanis last year in Minneapolis and while he did not play well the ‘Cats lost 31-3. But the difference here is Minnesota has no Mo Ibrahim who rushed for over 200 yards last season. This might put more pressure on Kaliakmanis and his arm. The Northwestern secondary needs to keep Kaliakmanis from having a good game if it wants to win. Moreover Kaliakmanis has thrown an interception in all three of his games. Northwestern needs to force turnovers come Saturday; they forced two in their win against UTEP and against a quarterback who has made his mistakes the message is clear. Whether Garnett Hollis Devin Turner Theran Johnson Rod Heard II or someone else they need to make a play. Whether it’s to set up the offense with a short field against a good defense or to keep the lead turnovers will be key in this game. The run game ""It doesn’t matter that Ibrahim isn’t around — Minnesota’s run game is still its strong point on offense. While the Gophers are only averaging 173.7 yards per game its much better than their passing numbers. Last week the Northwestern defense struggled against the run; Riley Leonard Jaquez Moore and Jordan Waters all found success for Duke."" The main back will be Darius Taylor who is averaging over 111 yards per game and Northwestern needs to keep him in check. This will be the premise of the game: if Northwestern is able to stop the run they’ll force Kaliakmanis to pass. If not the Gophers will do what they did last year to the Wildcats where Kaliakmanis passed for less than 100 yards but Minnesota still won by 28. Can Northwestern flip the script? It starts in the trenches. It always has been against Minnesota. It needs to happen in Evanston on Saturday. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After a 6-0-2 start to the season the Wildcats finally kicked off the Big Ten portion of their season on Sep. 17. Their first opponent: the Purdue Boilermakers. Northwestern took care of business 1-0 but it was clear that the Big Ten would be a different beast than NU’s non-conference slate. This victory can be used as a learning opportunity upon the ‘Cats quest for their first Big Ten Championship. 1. Need more shots All Sunday against Purdue Northwestern dominated possession. What the ‘Cats did not dominate was shots. They struggled to create many chances at all save for an Ella Hase goal that was called offsides. Purdue ended up out-shooting Northwestern 10-9. That won’t work against the likes of Michigan State and Penn State. The return of Josie Aulicino should assist with this task. She was relatively quiet Sunday with only one shot but she is still one of the best scorers and facilitators in the Big Ten. She already has four goals and six assists in only six games played this season so her comeback should keep Northwestern’s offense as a force to be reckoned with. 2. Reiley Fitzpatrick is HER At the start of the season I addressed the goalkeeper question. Would it be rising sophomore Reiley Fitzpatrick or graduate transfer Gina Muzi? Nine games into the season we have our answer. Fitzpatrick has seized the starting role establishing herself as the anchor of the Wildcat defense. No. 1 has started all 9 games playing a total of 781 minutes. She’s allowed only seven goals while making 21 saves with three shutouts to her name. On Sunday Fitzpatrick played with the poise of a four-year starter en route to the shutout victory. She made three critical saves in contest coming off her line at the opportune time to deny Purdue any goals. With the goalie position taken care of the rest of the team can focus on scoring without worrying about who is between the sticks.  3. Win with grit It looked at times on Sunday like the ‘Cats were going to have to settle for a draw. Reigning Big Ten Freshman of the Year Caterina Regazzoni made sure that didn’t happen. In the 57th minute she stood over a free kick just outside of the box. Seconds later the ball found itself sailing into the top bin before settling nicely into the back of the net. Regazzoni goes top bins!     pic.twitter.com/58NRb1k8dy Whether it be breaking a stalemate or coming from behind against Virginia Tech Northwestern knows how to win games. That skill cannot be undervalued. Even when they’re not performing up to their own lofty standards the ‘Cats are able to come out on top — an invaluable asset. If they can keep that up throughout Big Ten play the rest of the conference is in trouble. Next up for the Wildcats is Michigan. The Wolverines will traverse across the lake to take on Northwestern on Thursday Sep. 21 at 7:00 p.m. CT. Like Purdue Michigan was a Big Ten bottom-feeder last season. It will be up to the ‘Cats to prove they learned from their contest against the Boilermakers and take care of business.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story In a familiar place… Attempting to prove progress… Jockeying for any position other than last in the B1G West — these are Northwestern’s dilemmas of the week. When was the last time this column actually rejoiced over the team’s state?? Last week I opined that the ‘Cats’ win against UTEP elevated them from Hell to purgatory — knocking the stateside monkey off their back and setting them up for the chance to demonstrate progress. If you judge progress by wins the victory versus the Miners led to no overarching improvement given the immediate loss to Duke. But I try to remain an optimist when discussing Northwestern’s football team — much to the disdain of some Inside NU’s commenters often counterintuitive even to my own brain — and I think there are bright spots to be found among the bleak 24-point blowout Duke laid on this past Saturday. The ‘Cats’ contest in Durham was stacked with subtle implications that riddled the weekend showdown — a rematch for Northwestern after a brutal Evan Hull fumble virtually lost it the game in 2022. A victory would thrust the program to a win percentage in the green for the first time since 2020. It would also mark a massive upset against a top 25 opponent. But being realistic means understanding that an outright win against the Blue Devils was improbable at best. For David Braun and Co. the Week Three game was about demonstrating stability and a level of polish that’s long been lacking — keeping the turnover sheet clean avoiding the dreaded yellow linen notching an opening drive defensive stop. In pieces these things have appeared in NU games sporadically but a cohesive performance was what the ‘Cats were on the hunt for. Northwestern left North Carolina with a loss — and it’s well-documented that there are no consolation prizes in football — but this sort of mythical all-around game was achieved to some extent. Duke won 38-14 but NU produced the fewest turnovers it has in its last five games against Power Five opponents. It was penalized less than its opposition. Granted it hasn’t quite figured out the opening drive defense yet… The Blue Devils out-rushed the ‘Cats all day totaling 268 yards on the ground with the plurality of those coming from quarterback Riley Leonard. In fact every touchdown Duke scored on Saturday came on the ground. Less than four minutes into competition Jordan Waters found the endzone on a 24-yard rush. He found it again less than a minute into the second period. Northwestern’s front seven continue to be one of the weakest parts of the team allowing 494 rushing yards through three games. Ben Bryant flashed at times throughout the game first finding A.J. Henning for a 14-yard score right before halftime narrowing the deficit 17-7. Still the transfer finished with a 50% completion rate 123 yards in the air and a 1-to-1 touchdown-interception ratio.  The second half the third quarter specifically is where Duke did its damage. Durham’s Devils put up 14 points in the third period driving a cumulative 174 yards between its two scoring drives.  By the fourth quarter both teams’ subs were in. The ‘Cats tallied a charity touchdown with 1:27 to play as Brendan Sullivan rushed for six. The points didn’t matter for much besides softening the box score as the game ended 38-14. You may have read that abbreviated recap and now find yourself asking how I see positives in NU’s outing. First let me remind you of my optimistic streak. Second the loss can’t be chalked up to dumb mistakes and errant decisions. Northwestern managed to commit only one penalty for eight yards. Bryant despite his frequent uninspiring play held onto the ball for the most part. And the defense withheld Duke from points for a near 12-minute stretch between the first and second quarter. When all typed out lauding these actions as accomplishments might seem trivial and conciliatory.  Alas a win is perpetually the goal but for a program marred by controversy and instability a loss on account of a fundamental talent difference feels better than a loss catalyzed by cringe-worthy penalties and mind-numbing fumbles. You might almost think just for a moment that recruiting might be more of an issue than coaching and public discourse. Is that necessarily a good thing? That’s a whole other discussion. All this to say that on this Week Four Wednesday Northwestern finds itself in the familiar position of dealing with a blowout loss. Still it hasn’t totally backtracked on its potential to demonstrate forward progress as games against less formidable opponents await and building blocks remain in place. And at least for now it is free from the grips of the bottom rung on the B1G West standings — that title currently resides with Matt Rhule’s Nebraska.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Week Two of the NFL season has come and gone and several of the ‘Cats we’re accustomed to seeing in the pros were on the sidelines. Fear not as we’ll take a look at the Northwestern alumni that were able to make an impact for their squads. Rashawn Slater: Los Angeles Chargers OT Like always Slater was a bastion of consistency in the Chargers’ overtime loss to the Titans protecting Justin Herbert’s blindside for all 68 offensive snaps. He got called for a holding penalty in the third quarter but went another week without giving up a sack. Slater is on track for his second Pro Bowl and All-Pro selections if he can continue his dominant play.  The Bolts have gotten off to a less-than-ideal start to the season at 0-2 after some questionable coaching decisions from Brandon Staley but they will try to reverse their fortunes in Minnesota.  Week Three matchup: at Minnesota Vikings (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Greg Newsome II: Cleveland Browns CB Newsome II had a brief injury scare in the third quarter of Cleveland’s 26-22 loss after hurting his arm on a tackle but he was able to return to action on the next series. Head coach Kevin Stefanski said the third-year corner would be day-to-day this week with an elbow sprain. Losing Newsome would be a massive blow for the Browns who are already without Nick Chubb after he suffered a season-ending knee injury on Monday night. Newsome has been integral to a defensive unit that is giving up just 133.5 air yards per game (third-fewest in the NFL). He said that he expects to suit up against Tennessee where he will look to disrupt Ryan Tannehill’s connection with the Titan receivers. Week Three matchup: vs. Tennessee Titans (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Dean Lowry: Minnesota Vikings DE Lowry is continuing to struggle to make any sort of impact for Minnesota’s defensive line. They grabbed him in free agency after seven seasons of solid play in Green Bay but he has yet to show up in Minneapolis. Lowry assisted on a single tackle during the Vikings’ loss to the Eagles but was quiet in all other categories.  Behind Danielle Hunter (four sacks on the season) Minnesota is sorely missing contributions from their pass rushers. Lowry must rise to the occasion if the Vikings want to nab their first win of the season against the Chargers. Week Three matchup: vs. Los Angeles Chargers (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Ben Skowronek: Los Angeles Rams WR Rams head coach Sean McVay was able to get Skowronek more involved in their loss to the 49ers. The third-year receiver had a brief injury fright in the second quarter but he came back after halftime to contribute to the Rams’ offensive attack.  After getting blanked in Week One Skowronek ripped off an 11-yard rush — Los Angeles’ longest run of the day. He also caught a 10-yard pass from Matthew Stafford in a fourth-quarter drive that led to a field goal. Skowronek should continue to play a consistent gadget role for the Rams flaunting his versatility at multiple positions.  Week Three matchup: at Cincinnati Bengals (Monday 7:15 p.m. CT) Cameron Mitchell: Cleveland Browns CB Mitchell made his biggest contribution on special teams playing 23 snaps and recording a solo tackle. The rookie was thrown into action when Newsome went down with his elbow injury in the third quarter.  Hopefully Mitchell can continue to get reps as the season progresses and prove why the Browns spent a draft pick on him in April.  Week Three matchup: vs. Tennessee Titans (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Anthony Walker Jr.: Cleveland Browns LB Walker Jr. had a full-circle moment on Monday night as he returned to Pittsburgh for the first time since suffering a season-ending quad injury against the Steelers last year. It was more bitter than sweet for the Browns captain as he watched friend Nick Chubb get carted off with a stomach-turning injury.  Walker recorded three solo tackles and got to Steelers signal-caller Kenny Pickett for a QB hit. The veteran linebacker will look to rally his teammates in the face of Chubb’s morale-crushing ailment as the Browns take on the Titans.  Week Three matchup: vs. Tennessee Titans (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) ‘Cats that didn’t play this week (or record any stats): Evan Hull (Indianapolis Colts knee injury) Peter Skoronski (Tennessee Titans appendectomy) Earnest Brown IV (Los Angeles Rams) Adetomiwa Adebawore (Indianapolis Colts) Blake Hance (Jacksonville Jaguars) Tyler Lancaster (Denver Broncos practice squad) Ifeadi Odenigbo (New York Jets injured reserve) Godwin Igwebuike (Atlanta Falcons) Joe Gaziano (Atlanta Falcons)  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Welcome back to the film room. After picking up its first win in nearly 700 days on American soil Northwestern traveled to Durham North Carolina to take on No. 21 Duke. The game went as expected with the Blue Devils trouncing the Wildcats 38-14. NU could not do anything on either side of the ball giving up over 250 yards on the ground and scoring just seven points before both teams emptied their reserves.  ""Duke quarterback Riley Leonard was phenomenal on Saturday afternoon; however on the other sideline ‘Cats QB Ben Bryant struggled against a talented Duke defense. Bryant came into Durham after leaving NU’s win early with an upper-body injury but showed no signs of lingering pain during the game. The rest did not support Bryant well as the running game was all but non-existent. Interim head coach David Braun said NU did not play up to its standard and it’s hard to argue with that. Lets dive in and break down No. 2’s performance."" The Numbers It was not a day to write home about for Bryant. The sixth-year completed 17 of 34 passes for 123 yards one touchdown and one interception. His 50% completion rate was the lowest in his short tenure in Evanston. To make matters worse after his yard per completion jumped to nearly seven yards a catch that number fell all the way to 3.6 yards per reception. For his efforts Bryant earned a 59.2 PFF passing grade for the week. Now that is not as good as his 70.7 passing grade in Week Two but not nearly as hard as No. 2’s 30.1 passing grade in the season opener. PFF says Bryant had two turnover-worthy plays but made one big-time throw (a pass with excellent ball location and timing generally thrown further down the field and/or into a tighter window). The sixth-year saw pressure this week more than in the home opener being under duress on 13 snaps and completed roughly 40% of his attempts under pressure. Where Bryant continues to struggle pushing the ball down the field hitting just one of seven passes more than 20 yards past the line of scrimmage. Here is a look of all of Bryant’s attempts in Durham. The numbers accurately reflect the tape from Week Three so let’s dive in. The Good It feels like every week I am saying that there was a ton of good or nothing good.  This week there was not much positive to take away from the thrashing. Now a decent amount of credit needs to go to a good Duke secondary; however Bryant did not help himself. While the majority of this game was poor No. 2 did show some flashes. Despite finding the endzone just once Bryant did a good job of converting third down and staying on the field. No. 2 picked up eight first downs for NU with multiple conversions staving off punts. This is one of Bryant’s best throws of the day. Facing a third-and-long the Blue Devils come out in Cover 3 meaning the corners are eight yards off the ball and bailing on the snap. No. 2 realizes his leverage and easily slings it over to Bryce Kirtz for a fresh set of downs. Kirtz does a good job of pressing the corner vertically and stemming to the sideline to create separation and Bryant puts it right on him for the first down. Bryant does a good job of reading the coverage and finding a favorable matchup to move the chains. This entire eight-minute drive was an encouraging sign for the offense but this was a big-time throw from Bryant. Northwestern needs to start turning three points into seven points and converting in the red zone is key to winning football games. Bryant does not hide where he wants to go with the football locking eyes on Bryce Kirtz as soon as the ball is snapped. No. 2 gets into his three-step drops hitches and riffles one to the receiver’s outside shoulder. This ball is placed only where Kirtz can get it and Bryant sticks it on him right at the first down marker to move the chains. Just two plays later Northwestern found the end zone for the first time as Bryant connected with a wide-open A.J. Henning for a touchdown. The game was well out of hand by this point but this was a good job by the sixth-year to keep the ‘Cats on the field. Once again Bryant is not shy about where he wants to go with the football locking eyes on Cam Johnson on the snap. Bryant gets into his three-step drop sets and fires an out route to Johnson right at the sticks. Against man coverage Johnson presses his defender vertically and breaks out and Bryant puts the ball right on his target’s outside shoulder. The defender has no chance to make a play on the ball because of where the transfer placed it and No. 14 makes a phenomenal diving grab at the marker to move the chains and keep the Wildcats on the field. As the season progresses Bryant has gotten better at keeping the Northwestern offense on the field and extending the drive. The next step is capitalizing on moving the chains and finishing drives with points. The Bad Against a really good Blue Devil’s defense it was going to be a tough day for Bryant; however the sixth-year lacked consistency throughout Saturday’s contest. Being aggressive against a superior opponent is advantageous but Bryant put the ball up for grabs too many times putting NU in a poor position. Duke is in Cover 3 and only brings four but is able to get pressure on Bryant. As No. 2 feels the pressure he tries to sidearm it into Henning on the post route. However he does not see the corner who breaks on the ball and should have intercepted it. Now on third and long Bryant is trying to make a play but the sixth-year got away with one. The ball just hangs up in the air for too long and should have been going the other way. While Bryant often knows where he wants to go to the ball sometimes the defense knows it too. Bryant works all the way backside to Johnson and a hitch but hitches and waits for a second too long allowing the corner to read his eyes and break on the ball. The corner playing man coverage jumps the route and beats Johnson to the ball for the easy interception. This is the same type of play that got No. 2 in trouble in the season opener: staring down his intended target. Bryant did not have much help on this fourth down as his receivers were smothered and he had to make a play but he still needs to improve at moving defenders with his eyes. I say it every week but Northwestern left points on the field on multiple drives against the Blue Devils. Playing high-powered offenses like Duke NU needs to convert these scoring chances to stay in the game; instead it was a bloodbath. Duke came out in Cover 3 once again and Kirtz does a phenomenal job splitting the corner and safety on a skinny post. This is a touchdown if No. 2 can get him the football; however the ball is wobbly and way short. Bryant’s footwork is clean and he is not under any pressure but the ball dies instantly and is nearly intercepted. Based on the TV angle it looks like Bryant never had full control of the laces but it is still a throw he should make. Braun mentioned during Monday’s press conference that Bryant needs to play more consistently and plays like this are the ones the Wildcats need their gunslinger to start connecting on to not be the bottom-feeders of the Big Ten. This is another set of points left on the field by the ‘Cats. Joseph Himon beat the linebacker to the flat and with his speed had a walk-in touchdown if Bryant flipped it over to him. Instead the Cincinnati transfer sails it over No. 20’s head. Bryant’s feet are all over the place hopping like a bunny that leads to the miss throw. This is a throw most high school quarterbacks make and one that a sixth-year Big Ten signal caller has to make. For NU to win any conference game this season it needs to start doing the fundamentals on both sides of the ball at a higher level. Final Thoughts The jury is still out on Bryant who’s had a rollercoaster of a season so far. Heading into the bulk of conference play the Wildcats need No. 2 to play like he did at UC to break a nine-game Big Ten losing streak. Will he? We’ll see. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Northwestern seeks to return to the win column at home this weekend against the Minnesota Golden Gophers. The ‘Cats take the field under the lights at 6:30 p.m. CT in front of a full student section for the first time this season. The Duke game was a difficult return from the high of winning a football game for the first time in over a year against UTEP. But it was predictable and Northwestern has to push past it. The truth is this current roster doesn’t have the horses to compete with a top-25 team in the nation and that’s ok. It does however have enough talent to challenge the Gophers. Here are three reasons why Northwestern will get back to an even record and three reasons why it won’t. \nWhy Northwestern will beat Minnesota\n Athan Kaliakmanis The sophomore from Antioch Illinois has struggled mightily to start the season. He’s already thrown three picks to just one touchdown pass and has seven interceptions to four touchdowns in his career at Minnesota. Kaliakmanis was a four-star recruit coming out of high school and he’s also 6-foot-4 so some of the intangibles are there. But he hasn’t been able to put it together at the college level just yet. The ‘Cats are banking on that continuing this weekend in Evanston. After facing Riley Leonard and a high-flying Duke offense last weekend the ‘Cats’ defensive unit could use a bit of a break and they should get that taking on Kaliakmanis and the Gophers. With just 446 yards through the air this season Minnesota actually has fewer total receiving yards than Northwestern and sits in 12th in the Big Ten. There are other aspects of this offense that could give Northwestern’s laboring defense trouble but the quarterback shouldn’t. Cam Johnson Early returns look good from Johnson the Arizona State transfer who made his way to Evanston for his sixth season. He’s not a star wideout but he’s proving to be a serviceable consistent one. That’s about all ‘Cats fans can ask for in a year like this one. Johnson has caught 12 passes in three games this season for a total of 141 yards on 11.8 yards per reception. He’s yet to score but outside of the UTEP game Northwestern only has three total touchdowns. In Week One against Rutgers things got off to a bumpy start between Johnson and fellow transfer Ben Bryant when the two failed to connect on a couple of plays where Johnson had beat his man. But it looks like the chemistry is starting to take shape between the two. Johnson feels primed for a true breakout performance one of these weeks and a matchup against a middling secondary in the Big Ten might be one of his best opportunities to do so this year. The atmosphere and situation I think the fact that this is a night game at home works in Northwestern’s favor. The pressure will be on but that’s a good thing. This team has proven time and time again that it doesn’t respond well to being massive underdogs in games. In the past couple years the ‘Cats pretty much always fold quickly against teams they know are better than they are. But this is not one of those situations and NU will come out under the lights hungry for a win. The atmosphere at Ryan Field should also be very different than it was for the home opener against UTEP. All the students are back now and should be making their presence felt as the 12th man. Vegas’s 11.5-point spread must not be taking the quarter system into account. Additionally the ‘Cats have No. 7 Penn State coming to town next week and while I’m sure they’d tell you they’re only focus is on Minnesota they’re definitely aware of what’s looming. It makes the need for a win all that more pressing. Hopefully Northwestern can channel that in the right way. \nWhy Northwestern won’t beat Minnesota\n Ben Bryant Bryant makes the list again after another brutal game. It’s hard to view him as anything other than a liability at this point. He’s a liability I’m not yet ready to give up on but a liability nonetheless. Bryant was 17-for-34 last weekend for 123 yards and one touchdown pass. He looked good for one touchdown drive in the first quarter but then was never the same quarterback the rest of the way. So far this season his QBR is 25.2 which is tied for 122nd in college football. Yeesh. There’s still time for Bryant to turn this season around but with the lack of talent around him this start seems like a very bad sign. There was always a chance that his play at Cincinnati wouldn’t translate to the Big Ten and to Northwestern. Every week he continues to play this way makes that seem more and more likely. I’m not confident in him heading into this week because he hasn’t given me anything to grasp onto yet. Minnesota running game The Gophers had to replace Mohamed Ibrahim who went undrafted this spring. Ibrahim was a workhorse last year leading the team with 1665 rushing yards in his senior season. So far Minnesota has adjusted just fine. The Gophers are sixth in the conference in rush yards per game with 173.7 and freshman Darius Taylor has been really good. Taylor has racked up 334 yards and two scores on the ground. He’s not much of a receiving threat but the ‘Cats are more vulnerable on the ground anyway. The Wildcats struggled to tackle on most plays last week and bringing down Taylor is going to be a difficult task. Northwestern’s run defense is the second-worst in the Big Ten behind Illinois which is having a historically bad season stopping the run. The ‘Cats don’t win in the trenches often and when rushers get into space there’s nobody who has been consistent at bringing opposing backs to the ground. The missed tackles One thing that most really bad teams have in common is that they have tackling issues on defense. This is becoming a really glaring issue for the ‘Cats as this season wears on and it was really rough against Duke. Senior leader and middle linebacker Bryce Gallagher leads the team in tackles but has not looked particularly great captaining the defense. His biggest issue so far? Missed tackles. It’s been prevalent throughout Northwestern’s entire defense and it’s not an issue it can afford to have against the Gophers. Hopefully there’s been an emphasis in practice on finishing tackles because while there’s a lot of things you’d accept from a program in a rebuilding phase like Northwestern this is not one of them. Northwestern has to make tackles to win this game. Plain and simple. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Olsen @InvrrtedFB  Sep 21, 2023, 11:59am CDT      / new","Men’s soccer: NU’s stock continues to rise, but performances aren’t following suit", Even Jan. 2021 Gamestop’s value wasn’t this inflated. Share this story Forgive me for this is going to be a shorter article than usual. That’s because the ‘Cats are playing the same game every time they step onto the field or at least that’s what it feels like. The personnel decisions are consistent the tactics aren’t changing and the identity of the team has been established. Where Northwestern excels in each match isn’t a surprise and where it struggles shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone either. I’ve already raised my concerns with the game model Russell Payne is implementing in previous updates but to not sound like a broken record I won’t keep repeating them as the season goes on. Just know the sentiment is still there. Expanding on that if results start to falter and it turns out NU’s peak was reaching 13th in the United Soccer Coaches Top 25 in late September — which I fear it might be — you can bet it will be because of the issues I’ve covered. Friday Sept. 15 (Evanston Ill.) This game bore quite a few similarities to the ‘Cats’ clash with UIC just a few days prior. Despite being the home side and the presumptive favorite especially when UC Riverside hadn’t won a match up to this point Northwestern found itself out of possession for the majority of the contest. On its face this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The visitors wanted to dictate the game with the ball and as we all know NU is more than happy to play on the counter so stylistically this was just how the dynamics of the match were always going to be. This is where territory becomes important. If the defending team can limit progression even if it can’t win the ball back quickly via pressing it’s not in a perilous position. For the most part the ‘Cats were able to do just that. The Highlanders to an extent put too much of an emphasis on possession. They were often able to keep hold of the ball in the middle third by overloading the front of Northwestern’s defensive structure (usual 4-2-3-1) but that came at the expense of having enough options further up the pitch to create chances. This idea was best exemplified by the positioning of the “wingers” in the Highlanders’ 3-2-4-1 as they started so deep that the structure looked more like a 3-4-2-1. Often one of the WCBs would make a line-breaking pass to one of the forwards who’d look toward the touchline for an overlapping run from the wide man on that side only for him to be 15 yards behind where he’d ideally be. After UC Riverside failed to mount any considerable threat in the first period — for the reasons listed above — an Ugo Achara Jr. curler from outside the 18 gave NU the lead early in the second half. As is the standard response to being 1-0 down with the clock ticking closer to the final whistle the visiting side began pushing more numbers forward. In turn more space opened up for the ‘Cats to exploit in transition. Eventually Justin Weiss took advantage icing the game in the final moments after getting in behind on the left flank cutting inside on his favored right and bending the ball inside the far post. Tuesday Sept. 19 (Madison Wisc.) For those who have been keeping track Northwestern is now 6-0-0 when wearing the all-gray uniforms and 0-2-0 when wearing anything else. In their first test against Big Ten competition of the campaign the ‘Cats broke out the all-blacks and proceeded to in my estimation fail the assessment. The first question you should be asking is: had they managed to leave Madison with three points would my opinion be any different? And the answer to that is yes but only in the sense that I’d be once again criticizing a way of playing that yielded yet another win as fortunate as I might’ve thought the result was. Instead NU came away with a draw that feels more like a loss throwing away a two-goal lead — one it probably never should’ve had — in the last 15 minutes. The reason I said earlier I’m fearful this team has peaked is because of what it showed in this match especially the second half. This unbeaten run has been built like a house of cards and now is well and truly on the verge of collapsing. It’s not just that Northwestern couldn’t convert a 2-0 lead late into a win it’s the manner in which it found itself in that position and subsequently gave it away. Wisconsin missed at least three chances from point blank range before beating Jackson Weyman which is lucky enough on its own but then the goals the ‘Cats scored should be considered in the “How fortunate did they get?” calculation. First Achara Jr.’s opener. While it was a promising situation to begin with — NU had a 4v3 in transition — Weiss’ attempt to find Jayvin Van Deventer wide right getting deflected by a Badger right to the Wildcat CF certainly isn’t the cleanest way to capitalize. Then there’s Ibrahim Obeid getting an easy tap-in because a Wisconsin defender whiffed on a ball across the face of the goal. Both of these goals also came while the ‘Cats had been completely pinned in their own half while their opponents sent cross after cross into the box and forced Weyman into big save after big save. You’d honestly be forgiven for thinking this team was invincible after Obeid scored. However there’s no doubt now: Northwestern is far from invincible. The aura of impregnability has been lost the luck might’ve run out and even worse there’s a massive target on its back because it’s the highest-ranked team in the Big Ten. Opposing sides will give everything they have to get a result and it’s simply going to come down to whether NU can handle the pressure.

Share this story In its first homestand of the season Northwestern field hockey did not disappoint. The Wildcats took down Indiana 5-0 and the University of Pennsylvania 3-1 to extend their winning streak to seven straight after dropping the first of the season. The ‘Cats wasted no time in the home opener with Peyton Halsey scoring just 59 seconds in. That set the tone of the game as Northwestern held possession for most of the match and did not allow the Hoosiers a single shot in the first half. The Wildcats also kept the Hoosiers from a corner until the second half and only surrendered two while they earned seven.  Olivia Bent-Cole scored the second goal of the game toward the end of the first quarter corralling a pass from Lindsey Frank outside of the circle and taking on her defender head-on. The first year continues to be a pivotal piece of this Northwestern squad and it’s no wonder why. Olivia Bent-Cole is a cheat code  Q1 | Northwestern 2 Indiana 0 pic.twitter.com/QbuNwCSsBo In the second quarter Lane Herbert scored off a penalty corner and flashing a reverse sweep. Halsey assisted by Wadas notched her second of the game and moved to a team-leading six goals. The offensive onslaught didn’t stop there with Maja Zivojnovic scoring off another penalty with help from Wadas and Alia Marshall.  The dominance carried over to Sunday against the Quakers and the star of the game was Herbert. The junior notched goals in the first and third quarters for her third of the weekend and fourth of the season — already tying her 2023 total just eight games in. The first came off a redirected pass from Frank and the second came off of a reverse sweep what seems to be a signature move assisted by Aerin Krys.  Zivojnovic also scored her second of the weekend which similarly came off of a corner with assists from Wadas and Marshall. She and Hebert are tied for second in goals at four behind Halsey. Oh Maja!Q2 | Northwestern 2 Penn 0 pic.twitter.com/ucZtuXnaLy The defense also was once again steadfast surrendering just one corner and a goal with 10 minutes left. Up until that fourth quarter the Wildcats were held scoreless for 18 consecutive corners making the program’s longest streak since 1993. These two rather commanding wins left Tracey Fuchs with a lot to be positive about. Halsey’s veteran presence goes hand-in-hand with her being an incredible offensive asset and Wadas and Marshall continue to lead the team. But even more to be positive about: Herbert Zivojnovic and Bent-Cole have proved their talent and their capabilities. Herbert’s faced limited minutes in the past and Zivojnovic was sidelined for most of her first year but along with the first-year Bent-Cole they are key members of the roster.  Another positive: shooting accuracy. the ‘Cats outshot both Indiana and Pennsylvania in outstanding fashion with a 15-4 and 25-4 margin respectively. Of Northwestern’s shots 10 of the 15 and 14 of the 25 were on goal. A pretty admirable proportion.  The No. 3 team in the nation will look to continue its success this weekend.

Here are this week’s iteration of the Big Ten football power rankings. 1. Michigan (3-0 0-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 1 Last Result: 31-6 win vs. Bowling Green Next: vs. Rutgers The Wolverines continued their non-conference dominance last week throttling the lowly Bowling Green Falcons both in the air and on the ground. Running back Blake Corum had his second straight strong game rushing for 101 yards and two touchdowns including a massive 54 yard carry in the first quarter. Corum’s play helped cover up an off day for quarterback J.J. McCarthy who — despite throwing for two touchdowns — also threw three picks and had just eight completions out of 13 passes on the day. Michigan will face its strongest competition yet in Rutgers next week but it could be another cakewalk for an offense as versatile as this one. 2. Penn State (3-0 1-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 2 Last Result: 30-13 win at Illinois Next: vs. Iowa Penn State experienced its first Big Ten test as it took on the Illini in Champaign last week and the PSU defense proved to be too much for Illinois to handle. The Nittany Lions allowed just one touchdown in each half while the offense went to work putting the game out of reach in the early goings. The Nittany Lions will welcome the No. 25 Iowa Hawkeyes into Happy Valley next week giving them the greatest challenge they’ve had to face so far. Whether Iowa can outscore this multi-faceted Penn State offense however remains to be seen. 3. Ohio State (3-0 1-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 3 Last Result: 63-10 win vs. Western Kentucky Next: at Notre Dame Ohio State dismantled another non-conference opponent last weekend raising its point differential against non-conference teams to a whopping +81 points. Newly minted starting quarterback Kyle McCord threw for over 300 yards and three touchdowns while running back TreVeyon Henderson had two touchdowns of his own. They faced Indiana during Week One but the Buckeyes’ strongest opponent yet will come in their non-conference matchup against No. 9 Notre Dame next week who will likely provide a stronger defense than anything McCord and company have seen so far. 4. Maryland (3-0 0-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 4 Last Result: 42-14 win vs. Virginia Next: at Michigan State The Terrapins are continuing to develop and grow around quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa evidenced by last week’s come-from-behind win against a struggling Virginia team after being down 14-0 at the end of the first quarter. Tagovailoa threw for nearly 350 yards but it was the run game that sealed the deal with four touchdowns on 119 total yards. Maryland will likely look to run the ball again as it faces a weak Michigan State defensive line next Saturday. 5. Iowa (3-0 0-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 6 Last Result: 41-10 win vs. Western Michigan Next: at Penn State For now the Iowa Hawkeyes are ranked. That might change after their visit to the Happy Valley next weekend but they put up their best offensive showing of the young season against a weak Western Michigan team with quarterback Cade McNamara making the most of red zone opportunities and running back Kamari Moulton breaking the plane twice as well. The matchup against Penn State will be Iowa’s first in Big Ten play this season and in all likelihood their toughest. The Hawkeye defense might be able to hold its own against Allar and the receiving corps but what Iowa can do when it has the ball is a bit of a mystery. 6. Wisconsin (2-1 0-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 7 Last Result: 35-14 win vs. Georgia Southern Next: at Purdue The Badgers rebounded from a tough loss against Washington State with a relatively stress-free win against Georgia Southern. The early goings were tough for both teams but Wisconsin pulled away in the third quarter courtesy of three rushing touchdowns between Braelon Allen and Tanner Mordecai. Wisconsin should be more than capable of bringing that momentum to West Lafayette as the team faces a Purdue squad that allows more yards in the air per game than anyone else in the Big Ten. The Badgers have to watch out for the Boilermakers’ passing game but Wisconsin has been the better team thus far. 7. Michigan State (2-1 0-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 5 Last Result: 41-7 loss vs. Washington Next: vs. Maryland The wheels seem to be falling out from underneath the Spartans in the wake of head coach Mel Tucker’s firing and even though they faced a tough ranked opponent in the Washington Huskies a 34-point loss is still brutal for a team coming off two straight wins. Despite a relatively strong passing game Michigan State’s defense has struggled to defend the pass all season to this point which could be a problem when they run into Tagovailoa and the Terrapins this weekend. 8. Illinois (1-2 0-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 8 Last Result: 30-13 loss vs. Penn State Next: vs. Florida Atlantic The Illini got to host their first conference matchup of the season at home in Champaign and immediately fell flat on their faces. Their first four drives of the game resulted in a missed field goal a lost fumble and two interceptions thrown by quarterback Luke Altmyer.  Illinois managed to avoid complete embarrassment with a garbage time touchdown in the fourth quarter but ultimately U of I became another notch under Penn State’s belt. Lucky for Bret Bielema’s team it’ll get to face a much more favorable opponent next week in the AAC’s Florida Atlantic. 9. Rutgers (3-0 1-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 10 Last Result: 35-16 win vs. Virginia Tech Next: at Michigan Even at 3-0 it’s tough to call Rutgers a legitimate threat in this conference but that doesn’t mean the Scarlet Knights can’t enjoy success while it’s there. They beat up on a Virginia Tech team that’s been middle of the pack in the ACC capitalizing on a career day from running back Kyle Monangai. The carpet ride will likely come to an end when the Scarlet Knights head to Ann Arbor to take on a Michigan team which has bulldozed everyone in its path so far but the competition will all go downhill from there. 10. Minnesota (2-1 1-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 9 Last Result: 31-13 loss at North Carolina Next: at Northwestern Minnesota still sits atop the Big Ten West standings but it looked decidedly more vulnerable against a ranked UNC team on the road last week. The Gophers’ only touchdown came from a Darius Taylor two-yard run toward the end of the first half and they mustered just three more points in the second half as the Tar Heels tacked some on for good measure. The Golden Gophers will have a soft landing pad in a scuffling Northwestern team next week but there’s still a chance for them to fall if their defensive line isn’t in tip-top shape. 11. Indiana (1-2 0-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 11 Last Result: 21-14 loss vs. Louisville Next: vs. Akron The Hoosiers’ offense once again struggled to put points on the board with two third quarter touchdowns being their only points of the day against the ACC-leading Louisville Cardinals. Despite a late attempt to tie the game early-game inaction is ultimately what cost them. Indiana has had a tough schedule so far with losses coming against a good team in Louisville and a great one in Ohio State. But Akron should serve as a nice cushion before the team heads into nothing but Big Ten play. 12. Purdue (1-2 0-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 12 Last Result: 35-20 loss vs. Syracuse Next: vs. Wisconsin The Boilermakers’ defense once again looked like Swiss cheese this time against a maybe-not-that-bad Syracuse team at home. Quarterback Hudson Card had himself a nice day with 32 completions for 323 yards as well as a touchdown on the ground and one in the air but it was moot: the defense allowed the Orange to score on three of seven first-half drives. Purdue will be tasked with facing a Wisconsin team coming off a 21-point win but perhaps its run defense will pose more of a challenge for Braelon Allen and company. 13. Nebraska (1-2 0-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 14 Last Result: 35-11 win vs. Northern Illinois Next: vs. Louisiana Tech It only took one week for Nebraska to crawl its way out of the very bottom of the Big Ten. A dismantling of Northern Illinois is hardly a statement win but it was a much-needed one for a Nebraska squad with a new head coach and a two-game losing streak. The Cornhuskers will have one last non-conference game against CUSA’s Louisiana Tech next week which will at least give them the chance to bring some momentum into Big Ten play. 14. Northwestern (1-2 0-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 13 Last Result: 38-14 loss at Duke Next: vs. Minnesota Facing their toughest opponent of the season by far to this point the Wildcats turned back into a pumpkin after a feel-good win at home against UTEP during Week Two. Quarterback Ben Bryant managed only 123 yards on a 50% completion rate before Brendan Sullivan was brought in and the defense never really gave the ‘Cats a chance to stay in this game. Northwestern will take on a Minnesota group coming off a tough loss but with no momentum of its own to show and a new quarterback who is still figuring out life in the Big Ten it’s hard to have a lot of optimism for NU going forward.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The offense ranks dead-last in the Big Ten in scoring at 17.0 points per game and that also puts them 119th nationally in FBS football. The Gopher defense has largely been what I expected outside of Drake Maye hitting explosive plays on them last week.  Specifically against North Carolina last week not much more could have gone wrong. They had open shots on offense all game but the quarterback struggled to deliver accurate throws. On defense they allowed more than 20 points for the first time in their last nine games and numerous explosive plays and mental breakdowns from both the coaching staff and players went into that. Just so many uncharacteristic things with a P.J. Fleck team and they all compounded at the same time. Inside NU: With Tanner Morgan no longer with the program how has Athan Kaliakmanis performed in his first season as the starting quarterback? What are his strengths and what does he need to improve on? Ryan Burns: [Kaliakmanis] has been incredibly inconsistent. While the stats don’t always tell the story they do in this case. Through a quarter of the season here’s where the Gophers’ passing game ranks in FBS football out of 132 teams. The plays are there to be made but the third-year guy is struggling to hit them consistently. Minnesota’s pass-catchers of Daniel Jackson Corey Crooms Brevyn Spann-Ford and Lemeke Brockington among others are open and he’s just gotta hit them. Ball placement has been an issue with allowing them to catch and run. He’s got a great arm and is athletic enough to maneuver around the pocket to extend plays and run for a first down but he’s gotta be more consistent.  Inside NU: Last season Minnesota ran for over 300 yards on Northwestern and even without Mo Ibrahim the Gophers have averaged nearly 175 yards on the ground each week in 2023. What is the reason for the success on the ground? Ryan Burns:  Darius Taylor has been a revelation. He’s now the back-to-back Freshman of the Week in the Big Ten in his first games with carries as a true freshman. He’s run for over 100 yards each of the last two weeks and he’s a power back with patience. The Gopher offensive line has also really started to gel in the last two weeks after a rough opener against Nebraska. They brought it to North Carolina and Eastern Michigan so both Taylor and the Minnesota Moving Company have been playing off one another.  Inside NU: Northwestern brought in two transfer wide receivers in A.J. Henning and Cam Johnson. What will Minnesota do to defend the duo and what is your evaluation of the Golden Gophers’ secondary? Ryan Burns:  There’s been a lot of talk about Henning from the Minnesota coaches and players this week. They know he’s the most electric playmaker that the Wildcats have and that they’ll use him as a rusher slot receiver and returner. Minnesota’s secondary has held up more or less especially at corner. It’s been the newer safeties alongside All-Big Ten Tyler Nubin that have had mental lapses at times. Minnesota’s MO on defense has been to stop the run and not allow explosive plays. This week is no different. Inside NU: Who is your X-factor for Saturday’s game and what is your prediction for Northwestern vs. Minnesota? Ryan Burns:  Can Athan Kaliakmanis start to hit on his throws and find a rhythm? As I said earlier the pass-catchers and play design have been good but the inexperienced quarterback has been missing throws. If that continues Northwestern absolutely has a chance to steal this game at home. If Athan starts to hit throws this could get out of hand for the Wildcats in the second half.  I’ll say Minnesota wins 24-10 though which is a middle ground of all the outcomes to me. Northwestern has been inconsistent at best on offense and the defense has shown more leaks through the air than on the ground.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Northwestern heads home for its Big Ten West opener tonight against Minnesota marking the first time it will play a game with everyone back on campus this season. For the most part the staff thinks it could at least be a little closer than last week (maybe even with a chance to win?!) Iggy Dowling: Minnesota 24 Northwestern 13 Minnesota can run the football. Northwestern didn’t show it could stop Duke’s ground game whatsoever and tackled poorly. The Golden Gophers are in a really good spot to dominate time of possession. However given it’s a night game with students back on campus for the first time this should be Northwestern’s biggest home-field advantage of the year which could make it closer than the talent gap between these two teams might indicate. Bradley Locker: Minnesota 34 Northwestern 18 This game will probably shape up up as one of NU’s better chances to beat a conference opponent all year with the Golden Gophers 2-1 but averaging just 17 points a contest. However Minnesota boasts a strong offensive line and a potent two-headed rushing attack with Darius Taylor and Sean Tyler not to mention defensive playmakers like Tyler Nubin Kyler Baugh and Jah Joyner. UMN has killed the Wildcats on the ground in each of the last three meetings between these teams and based on how Northwestern’s defense failed to make stops in Durham I doubt that changes much. Natalie Wells: Minnesota 24 Northwestern 20 This will be the first game on Northwestern’s schedule in which Ben Bryant isn’t completely outmatched at quarterback. Golden Gophers signal-caller Athan Kaliakmanis has a 1:3 TD-to-INT ratio through three games and has rendered their offense wholly dependent on its run game. Luckily for them Minnesota has a star in the making in freshman running back Darius Taylor. If Taylor can rumble for over six yards per carry against No. 20 UNC that does not bode well for NU. The ‘Cats should keep it close for most of the game but they will ultimately fall as Bryant and the offense fail to measure up to their visitors’ output. Ascher Levin: Minnesota 21 Northwestern 13 Coming off a blowout loss Northwestern is looking to respond against Minnesota. The Golden Gophers heavily rely on the run game and their first-year running back Darius Taylor has run for 331 yards in his last two games. Last week the Wildcats frequently missed tackles against Riley Leonard and Jordan Waters so it will be paramount for them to improve if they want to win Saturday night. Minnesota has a strong defense led by ball-hawking safety Tyler Nubin. Nubin is one of the best safeties in the country amassing nine interceptions over the past three seasons. Northwestern has to keep the ball out of harm’s way if it wants to succeed on offense. While Minnesota doesn’t have the offense to dominate the scoreboard their run game and stingy defense will carry them to their third win. John Ferrara: Minnesota 30 Northwestern 17 The fact that Minnesota — fresh off an 18-point loss to UNC — is the undisputed leader in the B1G West speaks volumes about the state of the division. What’s worse is that despite the grouping’s uninspiring play Northwestern remains near the bottom of the totem pole. Northwestern’s outing versus Duke wasn’t as bad as many thought it might be and there were some positive takeaways — only one penalty and one turnover for instance. Still Minnesota knows how to run the ball and a weak interior defense has proven fatal for the ‘Cats so far this season. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the Gophers rush for close to 250 yards on Saturday. Ethan Segall: Minnesota 20 Northwestern 17 I really do expect this game to be far more competitive than prognosticators are forecasting. Despite Tyler Nubin lurking in centerfield I expect Ben Bryant to take a lot of the positive flashes we’ve seen over the past two games and turn it into his most complete game as a Wildcat. The key to this one in my opinion is the Wildcats’ defensive line. If that unit is able to generate some more penetration and remain stout in run defense (an issue the team has had against the Gophers in past matchups) Northwestern can force Athan Kaliakmanis into less-than-favorable passing situations. David Gold:  Minnesota 24 Northwestern 10 ""I think this game comes down to one thing: running the football. The last time the Wildcats and Gophers squared off Minnesota ran for over 300 yards. This past weekend NU gave up over 250 yards on the ground while the Golden Gophers rushed for 170 yards. Northwestern’s D-line arguably its weakest position group on the roster will have its hands full on Saturday night; however I dont think it can do enough to stop Darius Taylor and the Gophers rushing attack."" Ashleigh Provoost: Minnesota 27 Northwestern 10 Despite this being one of our more winnable games I still can’t see Northwestern managing to come out on top. NU’s defense has too many holes for a run game like Minnesota’s — yes their pass game is not that good and Kaliakmanis might be one of the only other quarterbacks in the Big Ten that compares to the three the ‘Cats play but I still don’t think the defense can do enough to stop them. This matchup will be run-heavy and I see Minnesota doing enough to break through David Braun’s defense and keep on scoring. Adam Beck: Minnesota 31 Northwestern 10 Stop Darius Taylor and Northwestern has a chance. But after the ‘Cats surrendered 268 yards on the ground to Duke a week ago I’m not so certain that’s entirely possible. The game will be within one or two scores at halftime but the Gophers physical and effective rushing attack will chew away any chance of a Northwestern comeback. Northwestern’s first Big Ten win of the season will have to wait. Noah Poser: Northwestern 21 Minnesota 19 Call it a gut feeling but this is a game where the betting line seems unusually large. On paper it’s clear that Minnesota has a major advantage in the run game both offensively and defensively but these teams are pretty even everywhere else. All of the outside factors including the atmosphere should benefit the Wildcats. Students are back on campus. It’s a night game. And this is the Big Ten West after all where nothing goes as it should. In all seriousness the game plan for Northwestern is simple. Force the Golden Gophers to have to pass the ball. They have the worst quarterback play in the Big Ten. Northwestern hasn’t shown the capacity to do that yet this season but call me crazy I think they pull it off this weekend. John Olsen: Minnesota 34 Northwestern 18 #InBradleyLockerWeTrust Brendan Preisman: Minnesota 27 Northwestern 17 Neither of the assumed starters in this game (Athan Kaliakmanis and Ben Bryant) have a completion percentage over 56%. However the Golden Gophers have something Northwestern doesn’t: a really good running back. Darius Taylor at 334 yards on the season is outrushing the entire Wildcats team. And in Tyler Nubin the defending All-Big Ten safety Minnesota has a player who can shut down any passing attack Northwestern tries to muster. It will not be fun football but that’s the Big Ten West for you.

Share this story David Braun choked up just thinking about it. Braun who tends to take the extra second or two to think about and phrase an answer when speaking to the media savored the moment to reflect just a little more. More than 20 minutes had passed since A.J. Henning grabbed him moments before tight end Charlie Mangieri capped off Northwestern’s improbable 21-point comeback over Minnesota with a 25-yard walk-off touchdown in overtime. It didn’t matter; Braun remembered every word. “Coach we got you” the wide receiver told him. “We’re going to win this football game.” Rewind another hour or so to when the Wildcats were down 31-10 with two minutes remaining in the third quarter. Darius Taylor had just plowed through Bryce Gallagher on a fourth-and-1 en route to a 43-yard touchdown run. The student section which began the evening jam-packed had nearly emptied. Yet the chatter on the sideline was about as optimistic as Henning’s. “I can’t tell you how many young men said ‘Coach we got you’” Braun said. “‘We’re doing this.’ All that tells me is that there’s a group that believes in one another and cares about one another very deeply.” His message to his players? “Stay the course” the head coach told them. It’s a phrase he repeated three times in that answer alone. It’s one thing to say that and another to do it in a game but living by that mantra is a whole different beast. But then again scoring 21 points unanswered in a quarter is also a different animal and Braun did that too. You probably know the story. Yes it bears repeating today. Less than nine months ago a man who had never coached at the Power Five level was tasked with transforming a Big Ten unit that was one of the worst in the nation in 2022. Just six months after that with less than eight weeks before his first game he was thrust into a head-coaching role to fill the shoes of arguably the most beloved athletic figure in Northwestern history. The program’s fanbase was divided as ever. While his wife was due with their third child he faced questions about hazing and racism scandals that took place before he came to Evanston. Reporters grilled him in a press conference setting before Derrick Gragg and Michael Schill took a single question. Braun an interim appeared to be a lame duck in a nearly impossible situation. Talk about staying the course. Braun’s unwavering steadiness shone through the Evanston night. What appeared to be another impossible problem for a team that hadn’t won a Big Ten West game at Ryan Field in almost three years turned out to have a solution that appeared pretty simple. It’s incredibly fitting that Northwestern made it look as easy as Ben Bryant’s three straight strikes to Bryce Kirtz because ultimately the difficulty of that comeback paled in comparison to the challenges Braun faced this summer. Above all it’s indicative of the head coach’s resilience both on the gridiron and off of it. Now with Northwestern surpassing its 2022 win total the number and volume of voices assuring “Coach we got you” may have multiplied tenfold.  And just as importantly he’s got them. Coco Azema who led the team with 10 tackles on the night shared that he lost his brother in August. The captain was just weeks away from successfully coming back from an injury that ended his 2022 season and Braun was just weeks away from coaching his first game. Immense stress seeping out on either end could’ve made the situation much harder for Azema than it already was. Not only did Braun ask if Azema needed to return home for the funeral but the interim head coach also offered to come with him. Braun sent Matt MacPherson Azema’s position coach to make sure a member of the staff was there with the safety. “Just seeing that guy cares that much for us and it’s never wavering no matter what happens” Azema reflected. “He didn’t blink when he got thrown into this role and he’s reached out to everyone on the team...“ “I want to go fight for somebody like that.”   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Week Four in the Big Ten had teams all over the map. While there were blowouts in store for some against conference foes others had games coming down to the final moments against non-conference opponents and one team even made a historic comeback within their division. This past week had a little bit of everything so it’s about that time again where we get to take a step back and break it all down. Let’s get started with this week’s edition of Around the Big Ten. Northwestern’s comeback It’s been awhile since I’ve witnessed a turnaround within a game happen as quickly as it did Saturday night in Evanston. Minnesota had all the momentum. It started off fast taking a 21-0 lead late in the second quarter and a 24-7 lead into halftime. The Golden Gophers extended it further to make it 31-10 heading into the fourth quarter… and then just lost it. Northwestern scored touchdowns on three of four drives in the fourth quarter concluding with an 11-yard touchdown strike from quarterback Ben Bryant to wide receiver A.J. Henning with just two seconds remaining. Its defense did its job too as it forced three Golden Gopher punts in the final quarter to allow the offense to force overtime. After Minnesota was forced to kick a field goal in overtime Bryant found tight end Charlie Mangieri on Northwestern’s first offensive play of the overtime period to walk it off for the Wildcats and complete the stunning comeback winning 37-34 over the Golden Gophers. Ohio State at Notre Dame While the previously discussed game may have been the most wild this matchup right here was easily the game of the week in all of college football. Ohio State controlled this for much of the game despite it not showing on the scoreboard and it being a low-scoring affair throughout. OSU led the Fighting Irish 3-0 at halftime before extending its lead out to 10-0 in the third quarter with a TreVeyon Henderson rushing touchdown. Notre Dame managed to fight back with a couple of touchdowns to take a 14-10 lead in the fourth quarter but unfortunately for the Fighting Irish they held that lead for 8:21 of game action and not 8:22. The Buckeyes scored the go-ahead touchdown with just one second remaining on a Chip Trayanum one-yard run to steal a 17-14 win in South Bend and get a staple win for the Big Ten. Big Ten blowouts Wisconsin beat Purdue 38-17. Michigan ran through Rutgers 31-7. Penn State blanked Iowa 31-0. And finally Maryland cruised to a 31-9 win over Michigan State. A quartet of Big Ten squads raced past their conference adversaries with ease this past weekend. Wisconsin got things started on Friday night showing that it might just be the Big Ten West favorite after all especially after the embarrassing showings by both Iowa and Minnesota on Saturday.  Michigan once again started slow but quickly put away any thoughts of Rutgers being a real threat. Penn State reminded us once again that it will contend in the Big Ten East with the Wolverines and Buckeyes while Iowa showed us that the improved offense was just fool’s gold. Maryland finally looked like the team it was expected to be at the start of the season as they got off to a quick start this week against a Michigan State team in turmoil and never looked back. Wisconsin is off this upcoming weekend but Michigan Penn State and Maryland all have very winnable games that should allow them to move to 5-0 so this should only build on their momentum moving forward. Indiana v. MAC (2023) The streak is over! For the first time in 16 years the MAC failed to have a team from its conference beat a Big Ten school. It wasn’t for a lack of effort though. Akron came oh-so-close to upsetting Indiana in Bloomington Saturday night to extend the streak to 17 years. Luckily for the Hoosiers they pulled it out in the end winning 29-27 in 4OT in a game that went back and forth throughout. On the MAC side of things it’s a sad day as they grieve the loss of this streak but at least they’ll have the memories they made along the way right? As for Indiana it was a much needed win for the Hoosiers if they have any hopes of making it to a bowl game with games at Maryland Michigan and Penn State yet to come in a very tough Big Ten East once again. The Big Ten (East) unbeatens Speaking of the Big Ten East four teams remain in the fight to become the last Big Ten team standing unblemished. To the surprise of no one among those teams are Michigan Ohio State and Penn State. However also with an unblemished record is Maryland who sits at 4-0 after its win in its Big Ten opener against Michigan State.  Now obviously at least three of these four teams are going to end up with a loss at some point so it’s quite interesting to look ahead and try to predict the order in which they’ll fall. Ohio State is on a bye this upcoming weekend while the other three teams have very winnable games. Looking ahead Ohio State and Maryland play Week Six in Columbus. Mark that as a loss for the Terrapins. Fast forward to Week Eight and there you have the Wolverines playing their in-state rivals in East Lansing while the Nittany Lions travel to Columbus to take on the Buckeyes. Penn State will take the loss in Columbus while Michigan will survive in that rivalry game. In Week 11 Michigan travels to State College and it wouldn’t be surprising to see it lose that one given each team’s current form clearing the path for the Ohio State Buckeyes to be the last Big Ten unbeaten. That may all be for naught when they travel to Ann Arbor in the final week of the season for “The Game” but it will be a nice consolation prize along the way if it stacks up this way for one of the Big Ten’s top teams.

Share this story Dear Reader I write to you with terrible news. For the first time this season Northwestern Women’s Soccer has lost a game. Two in fact. Aye but it gets worse. Not a goal was scored nor an assist recorded. For the first time since 2021 Northwestern was held scoreless in two straight contests. The first of the two fateful nights came on Thursday Sep. 21. For the sake of the rest of their season the ‘Cats should not remember the 21st night of September.  The vicious Wolverines from the northeast came into Evanston and attacked. With their No. 19 flag flying they pounced early when Gabrielle Prych tallied her fourth goal of the season with only six minutes elapsed.  Northwestern fought back hard firing off 13 shots to Michigan’s nine but Stephanie Sparkowski — the keeper of the foe’s net — defended fearlessly with six saves.  To add insult to injury the Wolverines struck once more in the 81st minute. By that point it was too late for the ‘Cats to mount a comeback leading them to fall. A few short days later the resilient Wildcat’s were back on the prowl. They set their eyes on a creature by the name of Hoosier in the plains of Indiana. The Hoosiers got wind of this plan and ambushed before the felines could react scoring within two minutes. Neither team knew it at the time but that lead would prove to be insurmountable. Indiana remained on the offensive allowing Northwestern nary an attempt on goal in the first half. By the time the dust settled the Wildcats had only manage six shots compared to the Hoosier’s 15. But not all is lost. After all adversity is one of life’s greatest teachers. The season remains long with many foes left to conquer. The next challenger should ignite a fire within the Wildcats. Their history goes back ages their rivalry born out of a turf war over the state they both call home. The Fighting Illini’s demeanor is in their name but it will only make the ‘Cats fight harder. This 28th edition of their matchup will take place on the 28th night of the ninth month seven hours after midday. Three days later will come another challenge. With their grain in tow the Cornhuskers will venture north in pursuit of the ‘Cats. Northwestern’s finest must be ready by two in the afternoon to defeat their foe. That is all for this report.

Share this story The UTEP win allowed the fanbase to stop dwelling on the past and curb the pessimism that loomed over the program. Two weeks later the Minnesota win allowed the fanbase to feel optimistic about the future of Northwestern football. NU at one point down 31-10 stormed back to seal a 37-34 overtime victory that marked the program’s first conference win at Ryan Field since October 2021. Not only did the win bring the Wildcats back to .500 on the season but it showed signs of a team beginning to establish an identity. Here are five things we learned on Saturday night: A tip of the cap to David Braun I don’t know about you but I find it impossible not to root for David Braun. Put in a situation that seemed headed for catastrophe like a barrel hurdling toward the lip of Niagara Falls Braun has not only salvaged a competent team but has doubled last year’s win total making him an easy coach for Northwestern fans to get behind. It’s not unreasonable to claim that with the state of the program headed into the 2023 campaign Braun has already outperformed expectations. A lot of teams fold over when trailing by 21 in the fourth quarter but all offseason Braun has told anyone who will listen about this group’s resilience and special character. It’s not just shtick. Saturday night proved that this team has a capable leader at the helm one who can get every player on their roster to play their hearts out. Of course Braun still holds the interim label. And it’s not unrealistic to think that considering Braun was a last-second promotion and the program awaits a multimillion-dollar stadium project Northwestern higher-ups may still want to dole out the big bucks to bring in a head coach of their choice for the next era of Northwestern football. But over the next eight games David Braun can make that decision awfully difficult for athletic director Derrick Gragg. A few more wins would seemingly go a long way for Braun’s long-term job security and prove that he is irreplaceable. The wide receiver room is a strength You can’t really talk about the wide receivers from the Minnesota game without starting with Bryce Kirtz. The senior wideout was B-A-N-A-N-A-S on Saturday night catching 10 passes for a whopping 215 yards and two touchdowns. A few notes on Kirtz’s evening: You get the point. Bryce Kirtz is going to haunt the dreams of Golden Gopher fans for a long long time. But it’s not just Kirtz that has me so excited about the receiver room. Cam Johnson has been everything the team has needed and more playing the role of the sure-handed perimeter weapon. He’s been dependable on anticipation routes and has quickly grown into one of Ben Bryant’s favorite targets. A.J. Henning has been the de facto playmaker for this offense through one-third of the season. He has been afforded opportunities to play out wide rather than only being used as a gadget like he was at Michigan (although Mike Bajakian has found creative ways to use Henning too). His touchdown catch to send the game to overtime justified that confidence in his ability to be far more than a speedy jitterbug. One of the biggest weaknesses from a season ago has now become a strength and it is the prowess of the receivers that can help to open up the offense for other playmakers just like we saw on the game-winning touchdown heave to Charlie Mangieri. Ben Bryant: QB1 Victory lap time! In this same column one week ago I suggested taking a patient approach with Ben Bryant saying giving the signal-caller a little time would pay off in a major way in the long-run. Turns out about a week of patience is all that was needed. Against the Gophers Bryant had unequivocally his best day as a Wildcat. The Cincinnati transfer compiled 33 completions on 49 attempts tossing for 396 yards and four scores and perhaps most importantly zero interceptions. What the box score won’t show you is the additional gall it takes to remain a confident and collected leader in the face of a 21-point hole. In the fourth quarter alone Northwestern tallied 148 yards through the air and converted five-of-six crucial third downs. Bryant was poised clutch and reliable when needed the most. Unlike last week against Duke Bryant was able to hit a few shots deeper down the field but where he excels is in the short-to-medium range. On Saturday night Bryant looked like a point guard with the way he was distributing the ball left and right. The gunslinger completed all 15 of his passes within five yards of the sticks and an admirable 67% of his passes between 5-and-14 yards. The emotion on his face at the end of the game showed it all. Bryant played his tail off and he made it easy to see why Braun stuck with him even when his play had some fans calling for his benching. Ryan Field... home field advantage? David Braun has emphasized over and over the importance of protecting the Wildcats’ home turf. Through two games in Evanston the ‘Cats have done just that winning both games.  I get it a lot of fans left when the team was trailing by three scores and missed the amazing finish; however as it turns out home field advantage isn’t just about crowd noise. Heck Northwestern’s win over UTEP was before the student body had even arrived on campus. That being said ‘Cats fans and students: show up and stay! It’s a small sample but the home-road splits speak volumes: This discrepancy probably won’t stick once Penn State comes to town but with four home games remaining on the docket the team has given the fanbase reason to make what is likely the final season at this iteration of Ryan Field a good one. It sure would be cool if this team didn’t have to pull comebacks to win games I love a comeback. You love a comeback. I’m never going to forget Saturday night. But even though the Cardiac ‘Cats are a real thing comebacks aren’t sustainable so it really would be nifty if this team stopped digging itself into such deep holes to climb out of. Despite finally getting a stop on the opposing team’s opening drive Northwestern has now been outscored in first halves 65-21. A minus-44 differential makes it genuinely impressive that Northwestern sits at 2-2 (the team is a glistening plus-37 in second halves and overtime). With a handful of very winnable games left on the schedule a course correction for these ice-cold starts remains imperative so no second-half heroics are required. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story As the final seconds of the third quarter dwindled from the Ryan Field clock the contingent of Northwestern students occupying the stadium’s student section for the first time in 2023 did the same. Through three quarters of play in the Wildcats’ Big Ten opener NU was trailing Minnesota 31-10 a deficit nearly impossible to overcome in such little time — after all UMN had a 97.1% chance to win to start the period per ESPN Analytics. Probabilities be damned. Northwestern did just that erasing a three-score hole thanks to sharp clutch defense and a near-heroic performance by quarterback Ben Bryant. The ‘Cats outscored the Golden Gophers 27-3 in the final quarter of the game and overtime garnering their largest comeback since erasing a 25-point deficit against Indiana in 2009 per release. While Bryant’s pass to a wide open Charlie Mangieri on a tight end leak sealed the improbable indelible comeback that play was far from the only one that swayed momentum in a purple direction. Here are ten snaps in chronological order — particularly beyond the ordinary — that proved instrumental in allowing Northwestern to win its first Big Ten home game in nearly two full years. 12:01 fourth quarter: Cam Porter’s touchdown run The Wildcats truly needed to punch the ball in the end zone from this down and distance and with such urgency and they did just that. NU began in a diamond formation with Porter behind Bryant and Thomas Gordon and Mangieri lined up as fullbacks. From there Gordon motioned over to the right side of the line while Mangieri moved over as a traditional FB. Out of I formation Porter found space courtesy of a good block from Ben Wrather and a nice double from Caleb Tiernan and Josh Priebe. 10:42 fourth quarter: Athan Kaliakmanis throws incomplete on third-and-seven While Northwestern’s offense put pressure on Minnesota to gain first downs and retain possession the Wildcats’ defense recognized it bore the burden of getting the ball back to Bryant & Co. After two nice tackles of Darius Taylor by Xander Mueller and Coco Azema NU forced a third-and-long. Playing zone the ‘Cats’ defenders did a nice job sifting through routes leaving no separation for Kaliakmanis. Up front Jaylen Pate’s strong pursuit chased down Kaliakmanis forcing him to throw the ball out of bounds — which set up a punt. 9:46 fourth quarter: Bryant finds Kirtz for a 17-yard touchdown If you want a dictionary definition of “taking over a drive” look no further than what Kirtz did on this series. After accruing 21 yards on a post-corner route and 31 more on a gorgeous fade Kirtz set up the Wildcats at the Minnesota 17 in a heartbeat. From there offensive coordinator Mike Bajakian made Kirtz Bryant’s top read yet again. Turning to a switch release Kirtz split the safeties in Cover 3 with a clean post route getting into the end zone for the second time on the day and in his college career. 7:06 fourth quarter: Kaliakmanis finds Brevyn Spann-Ford for three on third-and-five The Gophers picked up a first down in just two plays but Northwestern’s defense answered the bell yet again from there. Subsequent to two stops of Taylor Kaliakmanis located an open Spann-Ford on a stick route but Bryce Gallagher and Jaheem Joseph swarmed the 6-foot-7 tight end wrapping him up before UMN could collect a new set of downs. 3:01 fourth quarter: Mueller stops Taylor on third-and-two While the Wildcats had slowed the inexorable Taylor somewhat in the third and fourth quarters none of it would truly matter unless they could do so on third down. From the NU 36 Kaliakmanis again gave Taylor the rock. The freshman tried bouncing the carry outside but Mueller covered an unbelievable amount of ground racing over to chop down the star’s legs well short of the marker. This is a ridiculously difficult tackle especially given the angle speed difference and game situation — you could argue it’s the single most important play in allowing NU to gain life. 2:16 fourth quarter: Mark Crawford’s punt is downed inside the Northwestern end zone It might have been unfathomable for a special teams play to hold this much weight but this play definitely changed the tide in Northwestern’s favor. Following a false start (intentional or not) Minnesota punted from the Northwestern 37 aiming to pin the ‘Cats back in their own territory. Crawford did just that with a beautiful ball bouncing right at NU’s five-yard line. Awaiting the punt was Quentin Redding who was in perfect position to down the ball inside that territory. Instead Redding fielded the ball on two bounces enabling it to cross the white and give NU a touchback. That gaffe is truly inexcusable and was a swing of nearly 19 yards in field position. 1:31 fourth quarter: Bryant locates Cam Johnson on third-and-four Possessing no timeouts and with under two minutes left the Wildcats were in dire need of a touchdown on the ensuing possession or risked encountering a fourth down with the game on the line. On third-and-four Bryant connected with Johnson on a comeback route gaining 11 yards — and critically a first down. The play displays the anticipation of Bryant and overall chemistry between the two transfers who displayed trust in one another when it mattered most. 1:06 fourth quarter: Minnesota’s Jah Joyner grabs Bryant’s facemask on a sack Despite only rushing three and playing a prevent defense of sorts the Golden Gophers still generated pressure against Northwestern’s offensive line. Working against Tiernan Joyner pushed the LT back into the pocket then used his left arm to snag Bryant — and his facemask. Flags quickly dotted the field turning what would’ve been a cataclysmic loss of distance and time into a major gain. The clock stopped and Northwestern next snapped the ball from the Minnesota 48. 1:00 fourth quarter: Bryant finds Thomas Gordon for 16 The Wildcats maintained their rhythm after the temporary break. In enemy territory and understanding that he couldn’t take a sack Bryant stayed composed hanging in the pocket before zeroing in on an open Gordon down the field. The tight end’s second catch of the night and this drive secured a chunk gain and catalyzed NU’s eventual game-tying touchdown. Overtime: Mueller stuffs Bryce Williams at the Northwestern two It’s hard to precisely boil down this last play to only one option but I’d lean to this outstanding job by Mueller in crunch time. On second down the Gophers came out in 12 personnel with two tight ends to the right of the formation. David Braun and the Wildcats responded by putting six at the line of scrimmage. With a seven-on-seven blocking war the Gophers emerged victorious — that is until Mueller read the play and plugged the B gap in the blink of an eye. The linebacker’s ability to trigger fill in the hole and wrap up Williams ultimately led to a third-down incompletion from Kaliakmanis and a field goal from Dragan Kesich. The rest well is history. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After pulling off an improbable 21-point fourth-quarter comeback to defeat Minnesota 37-34 Northwestern is back in the facility to prepare for No. 6 Penn State. On Monday afternoon NU interim head coach David Braun met with the media to discuss Saturday’s thriller and incoming matchup against one of the best squads in the nation. Opening statement: “Excited to be back in our routine. The team was back in this morning to review the Minnesota game and what a great opportunity to clean some things up and identify areas that we need to continue to improve; While also celebrating a lot of the qualities and traits that we strive to put on full display as a program. The resiliency the grittiness the way that our guys put for four quarters.  I had a conversation with the group today that that’s the expectation. That’s the standard. That’s what this program is all about. Great opportunity for us to clean things up but had a glimpse at some of the things that this team is capable of moving forward. The guys will return this afternoon as we get into Penn State prep. We’re excited to have an opportunity to practice today. We have one heck of a football team coming in here. Very talented. Very well coached. Coach Franklin clearly has done an outstanding job within all elements of their program from a recruiting standpoint coaching in all three phases of the game they are playing at a really high level right now. So we’re excited about the opportunity. It’s going to be quite a task but certainly very very looking forward to returning Ryan Field.” On the offense in the second half: “In the first half there were a lot of self-inflicted wounds through penalties. There are moments where we were really moving the ball in the first half and just unfortunately couldn’t get out of our own way. I do think even though the second half involved a very explosive passing game the fact that we were able to move the line of scrimmage and establish the run game early played a factor in that The protection from the offensive line was a huge factor.  Obviously Ben started to really put on full display some of the things that we see out of him in practice every day and throughout fall camp. I think you see a group and a unit that is starting to find a rhythm and gelling. The questions continued to be about Ben but I think we saw a group around Ben that was fully supporting him protecting him in the pocket. Guys out on the perimeter making some big plays. At that point there was a lot of confidence and a lot of rhythm. It was really neat to see what that group was able to do especially in the fourth quarter.” On Ben Bryant’s health:  “It’s just part of playing quarterback at this level. Ben finished the game and showed his toughness and his grittiness. He’s back in the facility today going through his typical routine and excited to move on to Penn State.” On the community’s response to the win:  “The outpouring of support has been really neat. Everywhere from alumni former players parents of current players mentors people that I’ve coached with high school buddies the list goes on and on. It’s really neat but the moments I cherish the most honestly are the time with my family postgame and the time with our players postgame.  A little bit of a reprieve Sunday morning with my family breakfast with the boys; you walk back into this facility and it’s like hey what do we need to learn from this last one. It’s a sprint to get ready for Penn State and get ready for practice this afternoon. As much as there was a great deal of enjoyment and all that it’s been that’s part of the Big Ten schedule so on to the next but awesome Saturday evening.  So cool to see the outpouring of support from so many different areas in the Northwestern community and really excited to continue to channel all this positive energy and put that into our preparation for Penn State.” On his competitive spirit and motivating the team:  “There’s no doubt in my mind that is within our young man and burns at a very high level. What I would say is this group is a group of high character quality young men that want to do right. They want to please they want to do what they’re being coached to do and sometimes that can get in your way of just really cutting it loose and going and playing free.  I truly believe that God has gifted me with patience and poise. I’ve done my best to put that on full display over the course of time that I’ve been at Northwestern but I feel like I’ve also been gifted with an intense competitive spirit. I think that’s allowed me to find success in a lot of different areas of my life. I really started to get a sense that post-Duke I needed to do a better job of letting that side of who I am be on full display more often. I think all that is done is help pull that out of our own guys things that already existed within their competitive demeanor and who they are. I think when they see a coach letting it rip and coaching free with a great deal of passion and energy and love for the people that I’m around in the game that we get to play and get to coach you certainly hope that is embodied within your team. The neat thing is we didn’t just see that on Saturday we saw that in the way that this group practiced on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday in the preparation for for Minnesota.” On how the offense can start faster:  “There needs to continue to be focus on just consistent execution because there are moments where we’re moving the ball but a holding call or TfL or sack and all of a sudden that drive stalls out. And then two drives later you’re back in rhythm negative play and that drive stalls out.  Everyone’s gonna get sick of me saying this but some of it comes back to complimentary football. Defensively we were able to get a stop on the first drive against Minnesota but after that did not play our brand of football. You can see what starts to happen in the third and fourth quarter when you start to stack a three and out followed by a five-play drive and the ball is punted. All of a sudden that momentum starts to build and that only helps the offense get in that rhythm. On both sides of the football we need to find some of that Mojo in the first quarter to get going. That only helps an offense continue to turn positive plays into positive drives and points.” On punting on fourth and one on the opening drive: “Punting that ball no matter what. Strictly coming from a standpoint of with the operation that we’re dealing with in Duke being a tempo operation a certain style of play the level that quarterback had been playing with at Duke that was an opportunity for us at Duke to be aggressive to find some ways to get an early drive and get points on the board.  At that point in the game against Minnesota the way that Minnesota operates offensively it could really be a game that possessions were limited field position was going to play a critical role and points were going to be at a premium. That proved to not be the case but at the time of the decision I felt very confident and the decision that we went with.” On new gameday operations:  “It’s been a transition directly from our team Hotel over the Ryan Field. It’s been returning to instead of a locker room setup that had been utilized during COVID in Welsh Ryan atrium area back into the old locker room. The way that we had structured things in the past was really well thought out but there had just been some requests from our leadership and our players that they were looking for a new rhythm at home and they didn’t want to be going from the hotel over to the facility and back over to Ryan Field.  They wanted to have a direct line from the hotel over to Ryan Field and we listened. We took feedback and we’re talking about throwing a curveball at that staff in early August. A lot of people in athletics easily could have looked at us and said ‘Dave we’re going to keep this status quo the way that it has been.’ And they said whatever you need and they’ve gone to work. They’ve worked really urgently along with our director of football operations Alex Knisley and created an environment that we’re able to replicate in fall camp. I think our guys have found it to be conducive to their routine on game day.” ""On Bryce Kritz injuries and confidence:   “I think goes both ways. I think especially at the wide receiver position both those things at times can be hard to come by simply from a standpoint of your consistency maybe showing up play in and play out. But your opportunity for actual production may not just depend on the coverage the team is playing  or the quarterbacks progression and reads. His production was no surprise to us but just really neat to see all that hard work consistency in practice and level of confidence that young man carries day in and day out come to fruition. An incredible game and production especially when the game was on the line.”"" On Penn State’s defense:  “They’re aggressive. They’re balanced You can’t find a weakness on that defense: really well coached willing to play tight coverage man coverage mixing some different looks find ways to put stress on you on first and second down not just on third down. You see a group that’s well coached and plays well off one another. They’re playing at a really high level and all three phases defensively very impressive.” On the safety group in run support:  “It’s been fun to see obviously. There have been times that the safeties here at Northwestern had been very involved in the run fits prior to my arrival. In terms of the structure that we have now a little different than it has been in the past. Those guys knew from the first install meeting in spring ball that they were going to play a critical role in run support. Those guys have really stepped up and all of them are doing an outstanding job. [Jaheem Joseph] making that big play on that pressure in the second half.  You turn on the film and you watch Coco play right now. he just plays with a different tempo demeanor and speed. You want to start talking about that fire that burns deep inside you that young man knows his purpose. He knows his passion. He loves this place. He loves his teammates and he tangibly puts that on film. I’m really proud of the way those guys are playing right now.” On time of possession and controlling the clock: “So much of it comes back to some of the urgency and edge that we talked about playing with. You want to control the football and you want to find ways to get the football back against an opponent that is going to make a concerted effort to do just that to you.  It all starts at the line of scrimmage and then plays into your technique and your fundamentals. If you want to consistently produce in that area and find ways to possess the football you better be the most physical team on the field on Saturday — which is much easier said than done It needs to start with our practice habits. Thought our guys did a great job of embodying that last week. Now the challenge is to stack another week this week as we prepare for Penn State. But without the ball you can’t score points and it is really difficult to create a rhythm. It’ll be absolutely critical that we do a good job of getting this operation behind the sticks and get off the field on third and fourth time.” On conversations with Derrick Gragg about losing the interim tag: “There hasn’t been as I’ve said before. If I’m just speaking really bluntly I think it can be a very easy distraction or trap to fall into to allow your mind to wander and where myself and my wife have committed to is we feel like we were put in this role for a reason. That’s to support our players to serve our players and be an incredible steward of the program moving forward. And letting all that take care of itself.  If that’s what’s meant to be in the long term that is an honor and a privilege we would take on with a great deal of gratitude and humility but that’s not what we’re concerned with right now. We’re going to support these players. We’re going to serve them. We’re gonna be great stewards of the program continue to recruit and make sure that as a family we can look ourselves in the mirror 10 years from now and be proud of the way that we handled it.” On how much tape of last year’s Penn State game he’ll watch: “You certainly take a look at it. Our defensive structure right now has a lot of similarities to the way that it was structured last year so there’s a lot of opportunities just to see how offensively they attack certain fronts certain coverages and certain alignments.  The conditions certainly played a huge role in that game and you’re probably starting to throw out the stats in terms of the run-pass percentages in those types of things. I’ll tell you what the one thing that has become very clear as we’ve continued to watch the tape from this season: the quarterback play the O-Line play the running backs the talent they have out on the perimeter the amount of points that this group is putting up offensively per game right now sometimes you look at numbers and you turn on the tape and go this doesn’t connect but there’s a strong connection there. This group is very talented very well coached and poses a great challenge for us on defense.” On conversations with other NU coaches: “With the context of the transition there hasn’t been a ton of time to spend with other head coaches other than an all-head coaches meeting here and there. But I have been incredibly impressed with not only the quality coaches within this program but just the character and who they are as people. The support the text messages the phone calls. Dave anything you and Kristen need let us know. We all know genuine when it’s real and every single interaction I’ve had with head coaches in this department assistant coaches support staff has been thoroughly genuine. Speaking of the outpouring of support the amount of text messages from other head coaches was neat for myself and the rest of our program to experience on Saturday night.” On Xander Mueller and Mac Uihlein: “We’re really excited about the way both those guys are playing right now and the depth that those guys provide that position. Not only at the Will linebacker position but other positions within that room is something that will be critical as we continue to move forward. But plan on utilizing both of those guys in both their skill sets. That being said you turn on the film and watch Xander in the fourth quarter that dude was playing fast and made some big time plays for us. He was playing in a different gear on Saturday and I’m excited for him to have that continue moving forward.”  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But a .500 record at 2-2? I don’t think a lot of us saw that coming and it’s worth celebrating Northwestern’s miraculous comeback against Minnesota on Saturday. After trailing 24-7 at the half Ben Bryant and the ‘Cats came storming back to eventually down the Gophers 37-34 in overtime. Now NU shifts its focus to perhaps the most daunting opponent on its entire schedule the No. 6 Penn State Nittany Lions. Penn State is 4-0 so far this season and none of its games have been particularly close. The Nittany Lions are coming off a 31-0 beat-down of Iowa a team that was ranked in the top 25 going into the matchup.  Suffice to say this is going to be an extremely tough game for Northwestern to win and it may even be unrealistic to consider avenues to victory. With that being said here are three important matchups to watch on Saturday as the ‘Cats try to achieve the impossible. (Hey nobody thought Northwestern basketball could take down Purdue last year either. Just saying.) Penn State running game vs Northwestern rushing defense This is one area where Northwestern will be extremely overmatched. Much has been made and rightfully so of the ‘Cats’ run defense being poor. Between shoddy tackling and an inability to win at the line of scrimmage Northwestern gives up a lot of yards on the ground. Even in the win last week Northwestern allowed 244 rushing yards. Gopher running back Darius Taylor had 198 yards by himself. Obviously this doesn’t bode well and Penn State has an even more potent rushing attack than Minnesota does. While the Wildcat rush defense is dead last in the Big Ten allowing 184.5 yards per contest Penn State ranks second in the conference in yards gained on the ground per game.  Northwestern will not be able to stop the run on Saturday. I’m comfortable making the prediction that there’s essentially no chance Northwestern completely neutralizes Penn State’s deep running back room which includes Kaytron Allen and Nicholas Singleton. But if the ‘Cats could just find a way to minimize it in some way to keep it from being the most noticeable mismatch of the season that would be a win here. However if Penn State runs all over the ‘Cats it’s going to be a long day and a tough watch. Ben Bryant vs Penn State’s secondary The Ben Bryant breakout game finally happened (we hope) against Minnesota. The Cincinnati transfer struggled out of the gate this season looking overmatched and uncomfortable with his receiving targets. But he flipped the switch in the second half on Saturday finishing with a stat line of 396 yards passing with four touchdowns and no interceptions. Bryant also finally showed some rapport with at least one of his receivers connecting with Bryce Kirtz 10 times resulting in a 215-yard game for the wideout and a Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week designation. It was a really encouraging game for Northwestern’s signal caller one he hopefully can build on. Again though Penn State isn’t the ideal follow-up. The Nittany Lions have the best pass defense in the Big Ten. Not only do they give up an average of just 138 yards through the air per game but they also have five picks on the season something Bryant was certainly susceptible to prior to last week. Corner and first-round talent Kalen King anchors their coverage and will be a really tough matchup for Northwestern receivers (more on that in a second) and it’ll be up to Bryant to find other ways to move the ball. Kirtz vs regression to the mean There’s no doubt that Bryce Kirtz had an exceptional potentially career-altering day against Minnesota. Whether or not it means he’ll be a dominant receiving threat throughout the season remains to be seen. Unfortunately the possibility remains that this was just a one-off. Obviously David Braun and co. are hoping it wasn’t but it would be foolish to discount the possibility. Even if Kirtz’s performance was a sign of what’s to come expect some regression this week against Penn State. King and the rest of the secondary are too talented to let Kirtz dominate the way he did against the Gophers.  An encouraging sign would be if Kirtz is at least Northwestern’s most consistent option in this game. The contest will likely feature choppy drives three and out’s and long defensive possessions but if Kirtz appears on the stat sheet in a meaningful way that’s a win going forward. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story With conference play commencing the Big Ten picture is starting to gain clarity. As per usual the Big Ten West is a hot mess and as per usual the same three teams appear to be the conference’s best. Hot off the presses here is this week’s Big Ten power rankings. 1. Michigan (4-0 1-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 1 Last Result: 31-7 win vs. Rutgers Next: at Nebraska Let’s call it what it is. Michigan started off its season with a cupcake non-conference schedule but on Saturday we finally got to watch Michigan play a conference foe. Michigan continued it’s consistent dominance recording a fourth straight game of holding the opposition to a single score and improving its points differential to plus-104. J.J. McCarthy recovered from an off-day against Bowling Green to his usual form and Blake Corum looked like well Blake Corum. As much as I wanted to reward Ohio State or Penn State for impressive wins the conference still runs through Ann Arbor until proven otherwise. 2. Ohio State (4-0 1-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 3 Last Result: 17-14 win at No. 9 Notre Dame Next: Bye week For those of you that tuned out of the ‘Cats game early figuring the deficit was too large and the comeback was unattainable you may have surfed the channels and been treated to an instant-classic in South Bend. Despite an overall shaky game from Kyle McCord who remains the biggest question mark on this team he led a 65-yard drive in 86 seconds to place the Buckeyes on the goal line where Chip Trayanum punched it in with a single second remaining. It was a gutsy road win for a team who needed a big win on a national stage especially after disappointing losses to other national powerhouses in recent years created the (somewhat ridiculous) narrative that Ryan Day can’t win big games. Speaking of Ryan Day we saw him about as animated as ever after Saturday night’s win. Lou Holtz should offer his services to any team who needs a chip on their shoulder — he could really make a buck or two by calling a team soft before a big matchup.  3. Penn State (4-0 2-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 2 Last Result: 31-0 win vs. No. 24 Iowa Next: at Northwestern Penn State really didn’t deserve to move down the rankings but it’s just a byproduct of an impressive Ohio State win that the CFP is certain to eat up come December. But the Nittany Lions have continued to look the part. The defense was dominant against Iowa allowing 76 total yards just four first downs and forcing four turnovers. Drew Allar tossed four touchdowns as Penn State continued to cruise. In late October Penn State faces Ohio State which will be the real test. Until then Penn State is just like Arizona basketball to me I’ll believe it when I see it. I’ve been duped too many times by strong starts to the season to fully buy in. 4. Maryland (4-0 1-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 4 Last Result: 31-9 win at Michigan State Next: vs. Indiana This Maryland team is starting to look like the real deal. As much as a mess as Michigan State has been marching into East Lansing and running up the score on the home team is no small feat. The Maryland defense forced five turnovers and Taulia Tagovailoa continued his impressive start to the season with a 223-yard three-touchdown day. Just like Penn State the matchup against Ohio State in two weeks is where we will see just how real this team is. If the Terps can keep up with the Buckeyes we’ll need to have a thorough conversation. 5. Iowa (3-1 0-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 5 Last Result: 31-0 loss at Penn State Next: vs. Michigan State Iowa deserves to fall down this list after being trounced by the Nittany Lions but unfortunately no other team in the conference has proved worthy of taking this space. After a brief stay in the national rankings Iowa unsurprisingly dropped out after a horrendous offensive showing but we can still expect solid defense and elite special teams from the Hawkeyes which is enough to give them a weekly floor that is higher than any other team below them on these rankings. Brian Ferentz however is being closely monitored once again after dropping a big ‘ole goose egg on the scoreboard on Saturday. 6. Wisconsin (3-1 1-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 6 Last Result: 38-17 win at Purdue Next: Bye week Could Wisconsin and Iowa be swapped? Probably. Wisconsin’s win over the Boilermakers was impressive and the run game for the Badgers looks like it can give any defense in the conference some serious trouble but the Washington State loss is still stuck in my head. Although Washington State’s continued winning has retroactively made the Week Two loss look a little better the disappointment of that second half fully displayed everything that makes me nervous about the Badgers. Not to mention Chez Mellusi went down on Saturday and his absence could prove to be a major blow for the offense. Tentatively we’ll keep Wisconsin at six knowing a significant drop-off separates the Badgers from the rest of the list. 7. Rutgers (3-1 1-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 9 Last Result: 31-7 loss at Michigan Next: vs. Wagner A lot of teams are going to look overmatched when playing Michigan especially in Ann Arbor. Even though the Wolverines ended the Scarlet Knights’ undefeated streak Rutgers still has three solid and convincing wins against D-I teams and that’s something no other remaining team can say. Rutgers couldn’t get Kyle Monangai going on Saturday and when that happens it’s a real uphill battle. But with a battle against Wagner this weekend Rutgers should be sitting at 4-1 with a nice path to bowl eligibility. \n8. Illinois (2-2 0-1 B1G)\n Last Ranking: 8 Last Result: 23-17 win vs. Florida Atlantic Next: at Purdue If you haven’t figured it out yet this Illinois team is just not the same beast it was a year ago. A lot of talent graduated to the NFL and although Luke Altmeyer played well on Saturday this team has two narrow victories against teams they should have beat convincingly. The next two games against Purdue and Nebraska will go a long way in showing who this team is and if they have an outside chance at competing for the crown in the West. 9. Nebraska (2-2 0-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 13 Last Result: 28-14 win vs. Louisiana Tech Next: vs. No. 2 Michigan I kind of think Nebraska is okay which seems to be much higher than the general consensus on the Cornhuskers. A 14-point victory over Louisiana Tech is nothing to write home about but moving away from Jeff Sims and to Heinrich Haarberg has already paid dividends. This team is going to get absolutely stomped by Michigan it seems inevitable but I could see this team racking up a few wins in Big Ten West play. Matt Rhule is a program builder and his first seasons at Temple and Baylor were shaky but I expect to start seeing results by the end of this season. 10. Minnesota (2-2 1-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 10 Last Result: 37-34 loss at Northwestern Next: vs. Louisiana Minnesota should be three spots higher on this ranking but when you blow a 21-point lead this is what happens. It’s time for some reflection on P.J. Fleck — wins need to start flowing soon. Darius Taylor is still a real weapon in the backfield but even on an efficient day for Athan Kaliakmanis it is apparent that the Minnesota offense is limited by the lack of faith in their signal caller. A get-right game against Louisiana is desperately needed before a matchup with the Wolverines. 11. Northwestern (2-2 1-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 14 Last Result: 37-34 win vs. Minnesota Next: vs. Penn State Ranking Northwestern at No. 11 may be irresponsible but the middle and bottom of this conference is muddled so I’m rewarding recency bias and good vibes which the three teams below the ‘Cats definitively do not have. Even with Penn State next on the docket a Howard matchup follows giving the Wildcats a realistic chance to go into their bye week and the halfway point of the season at 3-3. It’s a fantastic development for Northwestern that Ben Bryant had his best game in purple and Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week Bryce Kirtz broke out with 10 catches for 215 yards and two touchdowns.   12. Michigan State (2-2 0-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 7 Last Result: 31-9 loss vs. Maryland Next: at Iowa The situation in East Lansing is an abject disaster. On the field the Spartans have lost their last two games by a combined core of 72-16. Off the field Mel Tucker has officially been fired for sexual harassment allegations which means that MSU players have the next 30 days to officially enter their names into the transfer portal. Expect some movement here. On top of all that Michigan State still has remaining contests with Michigan Ohio State and Penn State. It’s shaping up to be a season to forget as the Spartans in-state rival seeks another trip to the CFP. 13. Purdue (1-3 0-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 12 Last Result: 38-17 loss vs. Wisconsin Next: vs. Illinois For the third time in four weeks the Boilermaker defense surrendered at least 35 points which is just a recipe for failure. The Badgers manhandled (and Fetty Wapped) Purdue as quarterback Hudson Card struggled throwing two picks and completing only 55% of his passes. The Ryan Walters era hasn’t been pretty at times but a first-time head coach can be expected to take some lumps. 14. Indiana (2-2 0-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 11 Last Result: 29-27 win vs. Akron Next: at Maryland It’s a tough time to be a football fan in the state of Indiana with the state’s two Big Ten teams finishing at the bottom of these rankings plus Notre Dame suffering a heartbreaking home loss to Ohio State. It’s pretty rare to see a team win and get bumped down the rankings but when it takes four overtimes to beat Akron in your home stadium these things happen. The Hoosiers escaped by the skin of their teeth against a struggling Akron team that was fresh off a 32-point loss to Kentucky and a lot of the stats indicate that the Zips outplayed the home team. Akron finished the day with more first downs passing yards rushing yards total yards and a better third-down conversion rate but penalties and turnovers evened this one out. With Maryland and Michigan next up on the schedule it is starting to look like panic time in Bloomington.    \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story “Bryant in the shotgun Porter to his right three receivers left. Bryant takes the snap drops back to throw looking downfield. He’s got...HE’S GOT A.J. HENNING. TOUCHDOWN NORTHWESTERN AND THE WILDCATS ARE AN EXTRA POINT AWAY FROM TYING THE GAME UP.” I have no recollection of saying those words on WNUR — to be completely frank I blacked out — but I remember the emotions that fourth quarter and overtime brought out in not only myself but of every NU fan in the crowd. Just 20 minutes before Henning found the endzone you could hear a pin drop inside Ryan Field. Darius Taylor had broken out of Bryce Gallagher’s grip and scampered to the house to put the Golden Gophers ahead 31-10 with two minutes left in the third quarter. Northwestern students headed for the exit although a good chunk of the student section had already cleared out at halftime. As the clock ticked down it felt like the Wildcats were destined for the blowout loss that had become a staple of the past two seasons. The first-team offense which had only scored seven points against Power Five teams in 2023 had once again done nothing with the football outside of an 80-yard touchdown catch by Bryce Kirtz. Yet as the game entered the final frame something changed. I could bore you with the play-by-play of the fourth quarter but that was not the takeaway from the contest. In a game that felt gone in a season that already felt lost the Wildcats weren’t ready to throw in the towel. All of a sudden a team that looked dead in the water came roaring back to life.  It feels like this game was the perfect encapsulation for the 2023 season. After an abysmal 2022 campaign and losing most of its offensive production to the NFL or the transfer portal the expectations for the ‘Cats were at record lows. Add in a massive hazing scandal that saw the head coach of 17 years — and one of the best players in program history — abruptly terminated it would have been easy even understandable if NU threw the towel in before the season even began. Yet it didn’t. Coach Braun had the impossible task of taking over the program and trying to keep it from falling apart. It was not the gig he signed up for nor one he hoped for. It would have been easy for him to collect a paycheck and start looking for employment in 2024; instead he has given everything to this team. Has he made mistakes? Of course and he’ll admit to them; however it is difficult to argue that he hasn’t been the right person to lead NU during this time. If you glance over at the sideline you can see how his players respond to him — they love playing for him. Much like those players told Braun on Saturday night “Coach we got this” he told them the same thing back in July when he became their leader. When he was interviewed after the ‘Cats walked it off Braun was actively fighting back tears. He has given his entire being to this team and on Saturday night saw his work in full effect. I sincerely believe that in prior years the Wildcats would have rolled over but this squad has a newfound edge under its first-time leader. Braun summed Saturday up best — “pure joy.” ""The ultimate team win.""    pic.twitter.com/giTD88s5Xb Saturday’s comeback would not have been possible without the heroics of Ben Bryant a career college journeyman quarterback who finds himself at his third university. To be blunt No. 2 had not been good in 2023 entering the Minnesota game. It felt like every week fans were clamoring to see Brendan Sullivan replace Bryant as the ‘Cats’ signal caller. Although Braun has publicly stood by the sixth-year there were still plenty of questions about whether Bryant could successfully run the offense.  ""The first half this past weekend did not help his case as he missed a couple of touchdown throws to Henning and the Wildcats went to the locker room trailing 24-7; however in the second half Bryant showed everyone who he could be and earned the support of the NUFB community. For the clutch-time quarter he was as dominant as any quarterback in college football picking apart the Gophers defense with surgeon-like precision. Even with the game on the line he remained poised and executed a two-minute drill to perfection. His game-winning touchdown pass to Charlie Mangieri was the first time a Northwestern QB had tossed four TDs in a game since Trevor Siemian did it in 2013 (credit to Bradley Locker for finding this stat). "" For someone who has bounced around as much as Bryant has to have a career defining game in primetime — in front of his entire family — had to be a moment he’ll never forget LOOK AT WHAT IT MEANS TO BEN BRYANT   pic.twitter.com/LyXFGz2BRA Listen here ‘Cats fans you’ve earned this moment. For every Jim O’Neil falter for the last two years for all the ridicule over not winning a game on American soil for everything that happened over the summer there hasn’t been a lot to cheer about. Whether you were an alumni watching the game on TV or a first-year taking in your first game at Ryan Field Saturday night was a reminder of what fandom is all about. It is the highs and lows of sports that keep people invested: one minute you’re sitting in silence frustrated by a team you care so much about and the next moment you’re storming the field to celebrate. Those students who stayed the true diehards who have sat through a number of brutal losses in Ryan Field have a college memory that they will cherish forever.  ""I want to finish this Where are we Wednesday with this anecdote: following the game Iggy Bradley and I all headed to Bob’s Pizza to figure out what just happened and soak in an incredible moment. As we walked into the place tables of football parents and players populated the restaurant. As I looked around I couldn’t help but see the grins on everyones faces and the buzz in the air was palpable. For everyone in that restaurant gnashing on a slice of pizza Saturday turned into a moment that was unforgettable. 96 hours later and I still feel that buzz as I walk around campus.

Share this story Another NFL week another round of contributions from our former ‘Cats. Week Three featured a depleted cast of NU alumni as recent graduates like Greg Newsome II and Peter Skoronski missed their games with short-term injuries. Others like Evan Hull won’t be coming back so soon. The Colts announced last week that the rookie running back would miss the rest of the season with a torn meniscus. Here’s to a speedy recovery for Hull who will look to make a difference for Indianapolis next year.  With that being said let’s see which ex-‘Cats starred — or struggled — on the gridiron this week.  Rashawn Slater: Los Angeles Chargers OT Slater didn’t let an early holding penalty faze him as he and the Chargers’ linemen allowed just a single sack during their exhilarating 28-24 win over the Vikings. Keeping Justin Herbert upright was integral to Los Angeles’ success — he threw for over 400 yards and three passing touchdowns.  The 2021 first-round selection has been simply elite at protecting Herbert’s blindside since he was drafted. While the Chargers’ offensive line has been solid in pass protection the team has struggled to establish the run. Slater and his teammates will try to rekindle that half of their attack against a Raiders team allowing 127.3 yards per game on the ground. Week Four matchup: vs. Las Vegas Raiders (Sunday 3:05 p.m. CT) Dean Lowry: Minnesota Vikings DE Lowry played just 47% of Minnesota’s defensive snaps in their 28-24 loss to the Chargers marking a trend of dwindling playing time since Week One. The Illinois native didn’t record any statistics which should lead to a demotion to a spot in the dreaded laundry list at the bottom of this article. However I think Lowry’s lack of production is worth mentioning as he’s been pretty dreadful for the winless Vikings.  This about sums it up:  ""#Vikings DT Dean Lowry has a 37.7 PFF grade and zero pressures in three games. That grade ranks 48th of 49 IDL who have played at least 100 snaps so far.Lowrys snap count has decreased each week and could continue to drop as Jaquelin Roy (9 snaps this week) gets more involved."" This might be a premature eulogy for Lowry’s time as a starter but Minnesota would be better off seeing what they have in Jaquelin Roy the fifth-round rookie out of LSU. Week Four matchup: at Carolina Panthers (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Ben Skowronek: Los Angeles Rams WR The opportunities for Skowronek to make a difference for the Rams are becoming fewer and farther between. He caught just one pass for three yards in a tough 19-16 loss to the Bengals on Monday night. However he did get a boost in special teams snaps seeing the field for 68% of those plays. Skowronek was a solid contributor during his four years in the purple-and-white. His best statistical output came in his sophomore season when he recorded 644 receiving yards and caught five touchdowns. The Rams took a flyer on him in 2021 using a seventh-round pick to bolster their receiving corps. Like his days at NU his best pro season has been his second. Skowronek blossomed as a utility piece in Sean McVay’s elaborate offensive puzzle occasionally putting his 6-foot-3 frame to use at fullback.  With Cooper Kupp close to returning from the PUP list Skowronek will lose even more chances to get his hands on the ball. The hope is that McVay can continue to employ his versatile skillset as the season progresses. Week Four matchup: at Indianapolis Colts (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Cameron Mitchell: Cleveland Browns CB The Browns were dealt a substantial blow before their clash with the Titans when news broke that starting slot corner Greg Newsome II would be out with an elbow injury. But Mitchell was up to the task. The rookie stepped right into the starting lineup covering dangerous route-runner DeAndre Hopkins at times. After playing just 13 combined defensive snaps over the first two weeks Mitchell held it down for 34 snaps at home. Mitchell didn’t have to do much heavy lifting as Cleveland’s pass rush absolutely dominated the trenches to the tune of five sacks. With Ryan Tannehill under duress all game Mitchell helped the Browns by playing mistake-free football. It would have been nice to see some counting stats but the fifth-round pick made the most of his spot start. Week Four matchup: vs. Baltimore Ravens (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Anthony Walker Jr.: Cleveland Browns LB Walker Jr. remains an integral part of the Browns’ swarming defense. As the starting middle linebacker he acts as an extension of defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz and his playcalling. Walker made three solo tackles and deflected a pass asserting himself against an unsure Ryan Tannehill.  Walker has allowed a passer rating of just 47.9 through the first three weeks of the season. Though a small sample size it’s representative of how disruptive both he and his teammates have been against opposing quarterbacks. Walker will look to wreak havoc against Lamar Jackson’s squad on Sunday afternoon. Week Four matchup: vs. Baltimore Ravens (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Blake Hance: Jacksonville Jaguars OG Hance is Ben Bartch’s backup at left guard so he didn’t see any offensive snaps during the Jaguars’ 37-17 loss to the Texans. However he got involved on special teams taking the field for Brandon McManus’s three field goal attempts and two made extra points.  It was admittedly an alarming result for Jacksonville who had high hopes this season after reaching the AFC divisional round in January. Hance and the Jaguars will try to return to .500 when they face the Falcons in London.  Week Four matchup: vs. Atlanta Falcons (Sunday 8:30 a.m. CT) ‘Cats that didn’t play this week (or record any stats): Greg Newsome II (Cleveland Browns elbow injury) Evan Hull (Indianapolis Colts torn meniscus) Peter Skoronski (Tennessee Titans appendectomy) Earnest Brown IV (Los Angeles Rams) Adetomiwa Adebawore (Indianapolis Colts) Blake Hance (Jacksonville Jaguars) Tyler Lancaster (Denver Broncos practice squad) Ifeadi Odenigbo (New York Jets injured reserve) Godwin Igwebuike (Pittsburgh Steelers) Joe Gaziano (Atlanta Falcons) Trevor Siemian (New York Jets) \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Sitting at No. 3 in the nation with a nine-game winning streak Northwestern field hockey is rounding into shape. It beat No. 11 Ohio State 4-3 on the road last Friday and soundly crushed Princeton 4-0 two days later. Here are three takeaways from those games particularly from Northwestern’s road Big Ten opener: Northwestern can win in different ways and that’s a great sign Heading into its clash with then-No. 12 Ohio State Northwestern had been tested; Duke Boston College and UMass are all ranked and two of those games were tight. But OSU was the team’s first quality Big Ten opponent as well as its first true conference road game. Like Northwestern the high-flying Buckeyes entered last Friday with just one loss — a 2-1 defeat at the hands of No. 5 Louisville as their only blemish. At that point Northwestern was on a seven-game win streak and hadn’t played in a contest decided by fewer than two goals in almost three weeks. Its defense had allowed one goal in its last five games. That changed instantly last Friday when Julie Rodijk took advantage of a deflection off Annabel Skubisz to put Ohio State up 1-0 just two minutes into the game. Like the Duke game Northwestern had to overcome an early deficit. Unlike the Duke contest Northwestern didn’t immediately seize momentum after a bad start. The Buckeyes responded to Ella Kokinis’ game-tying goal in the second quarter with a penalty stroke nine minutes later. It eventually took a few superhuman plays from Olivia Bent-Cole (more on that later) to really put the ‘Cats over the edge in a 4-3 win. Skubisz and NU’s defense weren’t great conceding three goals — two of which came on penalty strokes — on just four shots on goal. Ohio State was just the second team to manage more than 10 shots against Northwestern all season. Yet the ‘Cats found a way to come back multiple times and survive a slugfest with another potent offense. Given that No.  1 Iowa is still averaging north of 4.5 goals a game it’s encouraging to know that Tracey Fuchs’ team can survive a rough defensive game against a tough opponent. Plus to follow that up by taking care of business against Princeton is excellent. No trap games for this team! Goals aside the offensive pace continues to look great... Northwestern leads the Big Ten — which still has seven teams in the top 20 by the way — with 19.4 shots per contest. The team stats on NU’s website go back to 2014 and the ‘Cats haven’t had a higher mark since then. Plus 60.8% of those shots have been on goal. That’s the second-highest clip in the conference behind Ohio State and it’s about the same rate as the 2021 title-winning team. Through 10 games Northwestern has played like an analytically-minded person’s dream. When a talented team gets a ton of shots off especially on net it’s bound to score more with more opportunities. And of course when you score more you win more. That didn’t change against OSU and Princeton. The ‘Cats put up 13 shots on goal in Columbus and 20 total. They then erupted for 26 attempts and 19 SOG against the Tigers both of which were season highs. In that contest Maja Zivojnovic placed almost as many shots on target (six) as the entire Princeton team (seven). Obviously those numbers should begin to go down with late-season play coming around against the sharks of the Big Ten. But to maintain that clip against a team like Ohio State speaks volumes about the offensive firepower at Fuchs’ disposal. Plus the Buckeyes are also great on offense so beating them at their own game on the road is especially tough to do. And the best part is... ...it’s by committee! Northwestern’s production has come from a bulk of players and at every level. The ‘Cats have three players averaging over two shots on goal per contest: Bent-Cole Peyton Halsey and Zivojnovic. Lauren Wadas isn’t too far behind having put 15 of her own on target. For Halsey 20 of her 28 shots have been on goal and she’s netted eight of them for a shot percentage of .286. Each of those players has a different role with different minutes but that’s still very impressive. In the past Northwestern has certainly had multiple players who were capable of stepping up as top goal-scoring options; it’s why the ‘Cats have made two straight runs to the NCAA Championship. However guessing the No. 1 threat hasn’t been this unpredictable since before Bente Baekers got to Evanston. That’s a nightmare for opposing coaches to gameplan for.  While the offense tends to run through Halsey multiple players can step up as a dominant offensive leader. Against Ohio State it was Bent-Cole who did her best LeBron impression in his home state with the way she took over the game in the second half. With the game evened up at two in the fourth quarter she did this. This is a true first-year in her first week of classes that we’re talking about... ""She\s dangerous""  \Cats take their first lead on a goal from Olivia Bent-Cole!Q4 | Northwestern 3 Ohio State 2 pic.twitter.com/Xx1ePNkiZQ She broke two defenders’ ankles and beat the goalie in about five seconds. That’s making magic happen. However she wasn’t done: More like Olivia Bent-GOAL  Q4 | Northwestern 4 Ohio State 2 pic.twitter.com/x2pOzgkKsi Down one late the Buckeyes have an empty net here. Even though they’re passing it near the back end the last thing they want to do is get careless. But Bent-Cole’s pressure created this out of thin air. She forces that first pass backward toward OSU’s own net by simply attacking Delaney Lawler. Lawler’s pass wasn’t great but Bent-Cole’s elite speed really made the difference. With Northwestern up one most might play that situation conservatively and retreat but OBC did the opposite. It paid off in a huge way and it meant even more when the Buckeyes tacked on their third goal about a minute later.  Against Princeton Zivojnovic absolutely flourished on corners. All three of her goals came off those plays for the first hat trick of her Northwestern career. Alia Marshall who leads the Big Ten in assists per game spearheaded every one of those with her playmaking. Halsey dictated the attack both as a facilitator and scorer assisting two of those corners and putting one through herself. The Wildcats fired on all cylinders with goal scorers and facilitators at every level which is another great sign.  It also opens up opportunities for others like Kokinis’ goal against Ohio State. The first-year had a one-on-one with the goalkeeper in transition. There’s young firepower all over the place and it starts with the Big Ten Freshman of the Week and the conference’s Defensive Player of the Week. Stopping Halsey alone isn’t a winning formula for good teams because Northwestern has already proven that a ton of players can take on that goal-scoring role.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story For a team without a win in its own country all of last season Northwestern now has not one but two home wins to its name in 2023. Statistics indicate a team that’s played better at Ryan Field: the Wildcats have amassed over 600 pass yards at home compared to 352 at Rutgers and Duke not to mention the recent 21 points the team scored in the fourth quarter versus Minnesota to send the game to overtime. There have also been 10 touchdowns at home versus three on the road three interceptions versus none... I could name even more. Based on pure numbers it’s clear that Northwestern has done significantly better at home this season. What’s led to these numbers is an absolute mystery but I have some theories. 1. Other teams are intimidated by quietude For anyone who’s been to Ryan Field the atmosphere has a serenity that no other Big Ten stadium can boast. Out of the 47000 seats not even half are usually filled on game day; this throws off opponents like Minnesota who are used to a high decibel level and a crowd that would set records in Evanston. Teams have to prep for this kind of unique atmosphere. Take Penn State for example: Penn State practiced without music at the end of practice today to get ready for the Northwestern trip. Franklin said they have to be honest about the atmosphere. He asked if they’re an internally or externally motivated team. The extra effort is evident. If there’s anything that this tweet tells us it’s that Penn State is worried. The Nittany Lions are worried about the energy that Ryan Field is going to have —and that could mess with their heads just enough for them to lose. 2. Northwestern THRIVES on the energy from the loyal few One commonality between Northwestern’s UTEP win and the victory against Minnesota Saturday was this: the Wildcats were most alive when the students were few and far between. This team must be humble: too shy to perform to its best in front of a crowd and is one that needs the attention of only the most die-hard fanatics to succeed. And the Wildcat’s fanbase is filled with insane fans that will break stadium rules and run onto the field after wins. I mean how many teams besides Colorado and Duke have you seen storm the field? pic.twitter.com/eMZNpliLS2 That’s exactly what this team needs. Northwestern’s fans cause just the type of tomfoolery that throws other teams off — the thundering echo of the footsteps of field-storming Wildcats follow opponents on their way out. 3. Ryan Field is an absolute fortress Ryan Field opened in 1926. For those of you that are math-averse like I am that makes it 97 years old. Aesthetically there hasn’t been anything like it since the castles of the 12th century: the stadium even has its own knights (Northwestern security) guarding the stronghold (a grass field). The concrete walls greet teams on entry immediately striking fear. The wit of Northwestern students continues this culture as the game goes on with the academic elite sometimes hurling insults impossible for other teams to understand.  Northwestern student section is nasty. Yes sure all student sections are volatile blah blah blah … but some are worse than others. Northwestern is one of those. https://t.co/dIaqrfy7Dm This confuses opponents distracting from the football game that’s unfolding while also hurting their feelings.

Although Northwestern packed Welsh-Ryan Arena with a single-match program-record 4889 fans for the game Wisconsin was able to temper the crowd by the middle of the first set. The Wildcats hung in early against the Badgers thanks to solid defense and early kills from graduate student Julia Sangiacomo and senior Leilani Dodson. But with the score still close at 11-10 Wisconsin was able to step on the gas going on a 7-0 run and eventually winning the set 25-18. The next two sets didn’t fare any better for Northwestern. Although the Wildcats took an early 3-1 lead in the second frame the Badgers rattled off nine straight points. The deficit in that set for the ‘Cats reached 16 points before they were able to chip away slightly at the massive lead but still dropped that set 25-12. In the third set Wisconsin was done playing with its opponent. The Badgers led the set the entire way en route to finishing the match with a 25-13 set win. The Wildcats were simply outclassed by the top team in the country on Friday.  Northwestern had its least effective night at the net so far this season recording only 23 kills and posting a .079 hitting percentage on the match both season lows. In a repeat of Friday’s loss to Wisconsin Penn State came to Welsh-Ryan Arena and beat up Northwestern in straight sets on Sunday afternoon. In the battle of Big Ten felines the Nittany Lions were slow to get going early in the first set. They found themselves facing a 8-5 deficit after back-to-back kills from sophomore Kathryn Randorf. Later in the set Penn State only had a lead of one at 16-15 but it was able to control the set moving forward going on a 7-0 run to take it to 23-15 before eventually winning 25-18. The second set proved more of the same for the Wildcats taking an early 3-0 lead then giving up seven straight points. The ‘Cats were able to close the gap to 11-10 but then the Nittany Lions pounced charging out to a 25-15 victory. Just like Wisconsin in the third set of Friday’s match Penn State established an early lead jumping out 7-2. Unlike that third set on Friday Northwestern didn’t lay down and accept its fate. The ‘Cats showed some resilience tying up the match at 14-14. Northwestern hung with Penn State for the remainder of the set but the Nittany Lions went on a few runs eventually winning the third set 25-21 and leaving Evanston with a win. Similar to their match against Wisconsin the Wildcats recorded a below-season-average hitting percentage for the match at .185 on the night. One bright spot this match was that the ‘Cats tallied 31 kills eight more than they hit against Wisconsin.  There are no moral victories in the win-loss column but at least Northwestern rebounded in the third set. The team had a solid .313 hitting percentage which allowed it to stay close to the Nittany Lions throughout the set. Unfortunately Northwestern’s defense was the main issue in this one. The team allowed Penn State to pick it apart at the net with the Nittany Lions recording 52 kills in three sets and allowing a season-high .453 hitting percentage. Look for Northwestern’s defensive and offensive stats to progress back to its season averages against Michigan State (9-4 1-1 B1G). The Wildcats take on the Spartans at home on Friday night. Opponents are hitting only .168 against Michigan State this season so it will be key to establish an offensive presence early on for Northwestern.  Then the Wildcats head east to West Lafayette Indiana to take on the No. 17 Purdue Boilermakers (8-3 2-0 B1G) Sunday afternoon. Opponents are hitting better against Purdue this season than Michigan State at a .233 hitting percentage but it has a more potent offense boasting a .246 hitting percentage. One factor that may help Northwestern in this matchup is the fact that Purdue will be coming off a match against No. 2 Nebraska on Friday night. So Purdue may be either exhausted — which could work in Northwestern’s favor — or the Boilermakers may be steaming mad and looking to exact their frustration against the Wildcats. Either way Northwestern will need its defense to be in top form to get out of Indiana with a win. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Coming off a wild 21-point comeback victory over Minnesota Northwestern’s biggest challenge of the season is headed to Evanston — No. 6 Penn State. Leading the all time series 15-5 against the ‘Cats the Nittany Lions come to Ryan Field hot off the heels of a 31-0 win over Iowa last weekend. Facing a team with College Football Playoff aspirations David Braun’s Northwestern squad will be amped for the opportunity to play the role of underdogs. Here’s why Northwestern will shock college football Saturday and why it’ll be the next victim of Penn State’s perfect start to the season. \nWhy Northwestern will beat Penn State\n The Bryant to Kirtz connection Ben Bryant’s numbers against Minnesota: 33-of-49 396 yards and a career-high four touchdown passes. Bryce Kirtz’s numbers against Minnesota: 10 catches 215 yards and his first two career touchdowns. Whenever Northwestern needed an answer against the Gophers Bryant dropped back and threw a strike to Kirtz. Down 21 in the final minutes of the first half last weekend — how’s an 80-yard link-up for a score? Trailing by 14 with just over 10 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter — how’s a three-play 69-yard touchdown drive where every throw went Kirtz’s way?  Although Kirtz missed the opener against Rutgers since making his way back into the lineup Bryant and Kirtz have looked in sync connecting for 17 catches two touchdowns and 274 yards of offense. The timing and chemistry between the pair has been on display ultimately culminating in Bryant fueling Kirtz’s big night against the Gophers. Moving forward Kirtz’s historic performance allows Bryant to fling the ball over to A.J. Henning and Cam Johnson arguably better pass catchers with defenses needing to take Kirtz into account. With the way Bryant slung the ball in the second half to orchestrate the comeback this offense has the firepower to put points on the board. Bryant and Kirtz’s breakout performance has Northwestern’s offense feeling confident and dangerous headed toward its toughest test of the season. The belief in David Braun Northwestern’s first head coach to win its first two home games since Dick Hanley in 1927 has the locker room on his side.  “For the first time since I’ve been here you looked in their eyes you looked at their body language — they weren’t flinching. ‘Coach we got this’” David Braun said about his team’s resilience in the postgame press conference after beating Minnesota. “There was belief. They expected victory” Braun added. Trailing by 21 faith in Braun and Northwestern’s coaching staff is all the ‘Cats had left. And they came roaring back thanks to their preparation and trust in Braun’s system. “People want to go to war and fight for that guy” defensive back Coco Azema said referencing Braun in the postgame press conference after a 10-tackle performance against the Gophers.  Against a powerhouse like Penn State Northwestern is going to need to believe. It’s going to need to stick through Penn State’s punches and trust the coaching staff makes the right calls to keep the ‘Cats hanging around. A belief in David Braun’s program has already gifted two wins at Ryan Field — could we see another? Big Ten football at its finest A large part of the ‘Cats staying competitive against No. 7 Penn State and No. 4 Ohio State last season were thanks to slushy windy and stormy conditions. Unfortunately for Northwestern severe weather isn’t on the forecast for Saturday’s matchup in Evanston but that doesn’t stop a Big Ten matchup from dismantling in the most Big Ten way possible. Chaos is the number one trick up Northwestern’s sleeve. Northwestern’s got the disadvantage talent-wise; any way it can steal an extra possession or force and capitalize off a turnover is imperative. In the second quarter of Week One the ‘Cats opted for a fake punt against Rutgers ultimately failing as Rod Heard’s route came up short of the marker. And last week against Minnesota the ‘Cats ran a play that saw a Jack Lausch lateral to Bryant who tossed it back over to Lausch for a minimal gain. The ‘Cats need to embrace trickery if they want to fool the Nittany Lions. Lausch Henning Hunter Renner fake punts pick your poison. At the same time they need to take care of the ball playing smart football but embracing chaos — something easier said than done. The best thing about the Big Ten is anything can happen and with a little luck on its side maybe Northwestern can pull out a monumental upset. \nWhy Northwestern won’t beat Penn State\n Penn State’s ferocious ground game Penn State’s rushing attack ranks second in the conference averaging 210.0 yards per game thanks to the one-two punch of Kaytron Allen and Nick Singleton who became the first freshmen teammates in Big Ten history last year to both rush for 700+ yards in a season. Allen already has 280 rushing yards and two touchdowns through four games. Coming off a 21-carry 72-yard performance against the Hawkeyes the sophomore from Virginia has a lethal mix of vision and speed making him a danger every time he touches the football. Singleton who has 203 rushing yards and five touchdowns this season is an end zone magnet. Effective in the red zone the sophomore burned Northwestern for 87 rushing yards and a touchdown last year. In the last two games Northwestern has given up 512 rushing yards alone and ranks last in the Big Ten surrendering 184.5 yards on the ground per game. If the ‘Cats are unable to clean up their run defense expect the Nittany Lions to breeze past Northwestern. Drew Allar One of two FBS quarterbacks (Washington State’s Cameron Ward) with 125+ pass attempts and no interceptions this season Drew Allar has established himself in the Big Ten’s elite tier of quarterbacks. The sophomore signal-caller has thrown for 903 yards and eight touchdowns adding another 74 yards and a score with his legs to start the campaign. At 6-foot-5 Allar’s skill comes from his athleticism. He’s incredibly mobile moving away from pressure with good speed and accuracy on the run. From the pocket he’s got excellent chemistry with his receivers especially KeAndre Lambert-Smith a strong arm and great anticipation too. The total package Allar effortlessly threw four touchdowns against one of the conference’s better defenses in Iowa. Think about what the star sophomore is about to do against the ‘Cats especially with Northwestern’s struggles to pressure the pocket. A ferocious defense loaded with talent Through four games Penn State sits atop the country in total defense (219.5 yards per game) pass defense (138.0 yards per game) first downs allowed (46) and turnover margin (+11). The Nittany Lions are coming off a shutout victory over Iowa where they held the Hawkeyes to 76 total yards — the country’s fewest allowed against a Power Five opponent this season. Brimming with talented playmakers like corner Kalen King and defensive end Chop Robinson — two stars expected to make their way into the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft — Penn State’s defense has the ability to dictate a game. Look out for No. 11 Abdul Carter too. Wearing the number of former Penn State greats like NaVorro Bowman and Micah Parsons the sophomore linebacker’s tenacious pursuit of the football burst instincts and heavy hitting make him an under-the-radar game changer for the Nittany Lions after a slow start to the season. Expect Penn State’s physicality in all three levels of its defense to cause problems for the ‘Cats on Saturday. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Think back to the Northwestern men’s basketball program of old. Among the images that come to mind — likely a fleeting memory of a glorious full-court pass amidst the thought of many sub-.500 seasons — is a student section that so often went unoccupied. I mean who blames a bunch of busy over-achieving nerds for not wanting to go to a random Wednesday night basketball game when the line favors the opponent by double digits? This case study serves as a perpetual chicken or the egg situation. Was the basketball team bad because people didn’t show up to cheer for their made baskets or did students not show up because the ‘Cats were often doomed before the tip? Northwestern Athletics would argue the former.  On Sept. 18 NU Athletics sent out an email to the student body publicly announcing the implementation of a new ticket claim process for this year’s sporting events. The gist is that students earn between one and five points for attending different teams’ games which they can accumulate to nab coveted basketball tickets come winter time. Predictably more points are divvied out at the competitions of the ‘Cats’ more neglected sports. Women’s basketball leads the pack gifting students five points in exchange for their support. Four points are up for grabs at the contest of any Olympic sport. Three points are awarded at football games and men’s basketball’s non-conference matchups. A measly one point is handed out at men’s conference games. The athletic department says the new system is in place to give students with the most passion the best chance of getting tickets to highly sought after games mainly February basketball bouts. This move comes after masses of students protested the ticket claim system the department used last year for men’s basketball games — one where students simply raced to press a glitching “Claim” button before their peers. My question is this: what is wrong with that ancient way of doing things — where students who get to games first get the seats? NU Athletics claims to be initiating a points system because it’ll help reward devout fans. Maybe. But the idea of forcing students to spend a Saturday morning supporting a women’s basketball team that looked allergic to the rim at times last year in the name of school spirit seems like a reach. Truly pious ‘Cats fans had every chance to attend those games and others last year and didn’t for a reason; it’s not because they don’t care about Northwestern sports teams it’s because they didn’t care about bad Northwestern sports teams. So back to my premise: make every game first-come first-serve. If NU Athletics wants a truly meritocratic system what’s a more even playing field than anybody having the ability to attend a game so long as they show up early? I promise you that a student who camps out two hours before a game — if that’s what the ticket market demands — is not going to go into a basketball arena and stay quiet. They’re invested at that stage. Fans who are half-in half-out on the idea of going to a game simply won’t arrive as early. You might argue that forcing a student to commit hours of their time to waiting in a line is exclusionary to those who have a class or a club meeting. I concede there isn’t a holistically perfect plan. But what’s more exclusionary is boxing out students who love their ‘Cats but are studying abroad missing a full quarter of point opportunities. What’s more exclusionary is putting incoming freshmen at a disadvantage to upperclassmen who have had years to up their totals (points roll over year-to-year); perhaps NU Athletics has a plan for this but it’ll certainly need one. I don’t intend for this article to be taken as an indictment of non-men’s basketball sports at Northwestern. Plenty of them are more than deserving of the sell-out student sections Boo Buie and Brooks Barnhizer got accustomed to last season. But I question how much more motivated students will be to attend a field hockey game when it’s for four arbitrary points (there’s no benchmark or leaderboard as to how many points will be enough for admission to a basketball game three months from now so who knows what four points really gets you) than when it’s for Wildside-sponsored pizza and merch. Admittedly volleyball had record-breaking turnout for its game against No. 1 Wisconsin and an impressive showing against Yale. But I’ll be interested to see if these figures keep up given that any time the top-ranked team in a sport comes to town it’s a big deal. Also Athletics doubled the point total for the Wisconsin game — up to eight. How viable is it to surge every event to incentivize students; is point inflation on the horizon? As has proven true in many cases Northwestern would’ve been better leaving it to students rather than trying to micromanage. If the athletic department would at least reveal its guise of a meritocratic-centered points system and acknowledge its urge to capitalize on students wanting to attend an entertaining revenue sport — a rarity at this school — I could live with it. You want more people to show up to women’s basketball games and buy more sodas and soft pretzels? Fair enough.  I’m sympathetic to meritocratic causes. I wish more people showed up to support lacrosse or field hockey. But leveraging attendance at one sports game in order to force fans into another is disingenuous and inconsiderate to truly passionate NU students who have impossibly busy schedules on weekdays when many of these point-worthy games occur.  Only a couple weeks into the program and many avid students are being beaten out by their peers who have figured out that points are often accessible as soon as entering a stadium arena or field. You can imagine that many then flock to the nearest exit. What’s worse is that I’ve been sent the points form from a friend who asked if “I wanted some.” Who could’ve predicted tech-savvy kids would catch on that they can share links with one another via texting? The best solution is the easiest one. Empower fans who want to cheer on any given day and stop keeping seats at games hostage. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Welcome back to the film room everybody. After a rough trip down to Durham Northwestern returned to Evanston to take on the Minnesota Golden Gophers. It was not a pretty start for the Wildcats who fell behind 24-7 at the half. As the game reached the fourth quarter NU found itself trailing 31-10 but the Cardiac ‘Cats sprung into action. Northwestern rallied for 21 points in the final frame to tie the game up at 31. Just a few minutes later Charlie Mangieri waltzed into the endzone to deliver NU the victory 37-34. The ‘Cats’ improbable win was led by the incredible play of Ben Bryant who had struggled so far in 2023. No. 2 absolutely balled on Saturday night so let’s dive in and take a look at how the gunslinger willed the Wildcats to victory. The Numbers Bryant finished the game 33-for-49 for 396 yards four touchdowns and no interceptions. It was the most passing yards a Northwestern QB had thrown for since Ryan Hilinski tossed 435 against Duke in 2022. Furthermore his four-TD performance was the most by a Northwestern Quarterback since Trevor Siemian in 2013. Bryant’s yards per completion skyrocketed after a measly 3.6 yards in Durham jumping to 7.6 yards this past Saturday. Furthermore No. 2 averaged nearly 12 yards per pass this week his most as a Wildcat. For his efforts the sixth year earned a 73.5 PFF passing grade his highest as a member of NU. According to PFF Bryant had two big-time throws (a pass with excellent ball location and timing generally thrown further down the field and/or into a tighter window) but had two turnover-worthy plays. Like its quarterback NU’s offensive line had one of its best days in 2023. Bryant had nearly three seconds to get rid of the football and was only brought down twice. He was only pressured on nine out of almost 50 passes including six on blitzes. Although limited No. 2 did struggle under pressure only completing 33% of his attempts while under duress. When protected Bryant completed over 70% of his passes for 362 yards and four TDs.  Where Bryant still is struggling is pushing the ball down the field. The sixth-year was three of eight on balls 20+ yards down the field; however he was extremely effective with mid-range throws. Here is a breakdown of every pass from the ‘Cats’ gunslinger. Now the stats show how good Bryant was but the tape is even more impressive. So with that being said let’s dive into it. The Good I could put the entire fourth quarter on this list but Bryant did so many things well on Saturday night. It’s hard to throw for nearly 400 yards and four touchdowns and not play exceptional football. Although Bryant played a good game holistically here are a few places where he really excelled. Bryant was dropping the ball in a bucket throughout Saturday’s contest. He was hitting receivers in stride and putting the ball in places where defenders had no chance to make a play. This is an absolute dot from Bryant. Minnesota is playing man coverage across the board and the Wildcats counter with four verticals. Bryce Kirtz wins off the line of scrimmage creating a small amount of separation from the corner and Bryant tosses a perfect ball. He takes his three-step drop shifts his eyes from the far side to the near side of the field and flings it out with ease to No. 17. Bryant could not have placed this ball any better if he went and handed the ball to Kirtz.  The fade lands on the outside shoulder of Kirtz who gets his foot down for a 30-yard gain. There is zero room for error as the corner recovered and is in phase to make a play on the ball yet Bryant gave the corner no opportunity to make the play. The ball was placed where only the receiver could make the catch and one play later Bryant found Kirtz once again to make it a one-score game. This is perfection all around. Perfect play call from Mike Bajakian a perfect route from Bryce Kirtz and an absolute seed from Bryant. Minnesota is playing Cover 4 and Kirtz runs a sluggo double move. The corner bites on the slant allowing Kirtz to speed right by him and get wide open. Awaiting the double move Bryant steps up in the pocket after feeling pressure resets his feet and hits Kirtz in stride for an 80-yard touchdown. The deep ball looked effortless from Bryant who had already missed a couple of deep throws throughout the game. In an offense that had struggled so far this 80-yard pitch-and-catch jumpstarted the ‘Cats for the rest of the game. Although not flashy this may have been my favorite throw of the game. After being pushed back by a holding penalty Bryant nearly picks up the first down on a laser to Marshall Lang.  The Gophers are in Cover 6 and No. 2 sees that the linebackers have dropped to their eight-yard hook/curl zone depth. Because the safeties are backpedaling UMN leaves the middle of the field open. Bryant who recognizes the coverage puts a ball on a rope to Lang over the linebacker and under the safety for a gain of 15. It’s a simple three-step and hitch but the speed at which the ball comes out of Bryant’s hand is impressive. While this throw will not be on a highlight reel it shows the QB’s ability to fit the ball in between defenders to keep NU ahead of the sticks. One of the best characteristics of the sixth-year is his ability to remain calm and maintain his mechanics. On Saturday even as the pocket tightened around him Bryant did not break down and forget his fundamentals. This is exactly what you want to see from a quarterback. Bryant drops back and looks for Cam Johnson as his primary receiver but quickly realizes that he is covered. Instead of trying to force the ball or take off running Bryant drifts back in the pocket to get more space flips his hips forward and whips a ball to Kirtz for a fresh set of downs. When the play does not go as intended it is very easy for a QB to improvise and forget their mechanics; however this is one of Bryant’s strengths. His footwork remains consistent no matter the situation or how much duress he is under — which makes for more consistent QB play. With these fundamentals I don’t worry about Bryant throwing off his backfoot and sailing a pass. First this is one hell of a play call for Bajakian. Second this is a hell of a throw from Bryant. Rolling to his left he sees Mangieri is wide open and pulls up allowing himself to reset his feet and make the cross field throw. Bryant hitches twice and unleashes a long ball into the awaiting arms of his tight end for the walk-off touchdown. To cap off a career day Bryant executed a perfect call because his footwork allowed him to step into the throw and deliver a game-winning dime. The Bad To be honest I have very few qualms with Bryant’s performance on Saturday night so I am going to nitpick. Although the comeback was incredible the Wildcats should have never even been down 21 points. NU had multiple chances to score points but failed to convert. The Bryant-Henning connection took a few lumps before connecting on the game-tying score. Henning beat his man on the post but No. 2 just put too much on it. His footwork is good but he did not put enough loft on the ball. This is a TD if the duo can connect but the gunslinger needs to start hitting these throws. It was deja vu just minutes later as Bryant and Henning couldn’t hook up. Henning was once again wide open this time splitting both safeties but Bryant overshoots him. Everything else here is clean but the tandem needs to work on its timing to eventually connect on one of these deep balls. While Bryant played extremely well there were a few passes that left me scratching my head. When you are scorching hot you are more willing to take chances that are questionable but this was just a bad read by Bryant.  Minnesota drops eight into deep Tampa 2 and the Wildcats run four verts. When everyone runs vertically the squat corner is able to run with the route and the Gophers ran it to perfection. Cam Johnson is swallowed up with the corner underneath and the safety right on top. This should have been intercepted but UMN can’t come down with it. Bryant decided where he wanted to go with the ball pre-snap and ended up throwing into double coverage. If he had gone through his progression he would have found Cam Porter wide open for a checkdown with plenty of room to run.  Final Thoughts Bryant was absolutely dominant on Saturday night shushing everyone who was calling for Brendan Sullivan to replace him. This was the type of performance NU expected when it brought No. 2 in this past spring and he put on a passing show.    \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After a thrilling comeback win over Minnesota Northwestern faces its toughest opponent of the season: No. 6 Penn State. Many of the same faces from NU’s 17-7 loss in Happy Valley last year are back and better. They’ve helped lead the Nittany Lions to a 4-0 start in which James Franklin hasn’t secured a win by a margin tighter than 17 points. Inside NU spoke with Black Shoe Diaries writer (and Northwestern alum!) Brian Bennett to learn a little more about PSU heading into Saturday: INU: Based on the first four weeks it’s pretty clear that the PSU defense is phenomenal. What weaknesses if any does it have? Brian Bennett: Back in July I was asked to write a piece outlining what could be weaknesses in Penn State’s defense. To be honest it was a tough assignment. The biggest question was that Penn State had issues last year against the run — mostly in the loss to Michigan but also with dual-threat quarterbacks. Well Penn State is third in the conference right now against the run barely behind Michigan and set to move up when Nebraska stops playing pass-heavy teams. So I think through four games it’s turned that weakness into a strength. The Lions are extremely aggressive on defense and sometimes that leads to them over running plays. We saw that happen a bit in the opener against West Virginia and also early against Illinois. Using some misdirection to slow them down even worked on the few successful plays that Iowa’s offense had last Saturday. INU: Drew Allar’s looked great thus far — what’s been the primary reason behind that and do you think it holds up as the schedule gets tougher? BB: Well he’s a talented and composed young player who is being protected. The offensive line has been outstanding in pass blocking and Allar has stayed within himself and taken what the defense has given. Last Saturday was the perfect example. His stats won’t wow you in terms of yardage but he did pass for four touchdowns and just seemed fully in control the whole night. The stat that is going to get the most play on Saturday is the fact that through 15 appearances and four starts he has not committed a single turnover. I don’t think it’s realistic for that to hold up through Big Ten play especially since he easily could have had two interceptions in the opener against West Virginia. Penn State will need him to push the ball downfield more often and make tougher throws to reach its stated goal of a Big Ten title. INU: What’s the general expectation around State College right now? Is there a CFP-or-bust feeling? BB: Absolutely. A quick history lesson. Penn State won the Big Ten in 2016 but finished fifth in the final College Football Playoff rankings and missed out on a spot in the semifinals. Many fans believed that Penn State would break through soon especially since they’d beaten Ohio State in that conference title year. But they haven’t topped the Buckeyes since and Ohio State has been a regular in the playoffs. Meanwhile Michigan and Penn State had been alternating second-place East finishes until 2021. The Wolverines scored a late touchdown to top Penn State and they haven’t dropped a conference game since. Before last season any Penn State fan would have signed up for a Rose Bowl win and a spot in the Top 10 to close out the year. The Lions got that but some fans felt that was even hollow since their two losses were to playoff participants Michigan and Ohio State. Maybe it’s not a full blown CFP-or-bust attitude but a beat at least one of those this year mindset. INU: Is there anything about Northwestern that worries the fanbase — even if it’s something as simple as the fear of Saturday being a trap game? Sure. I think there will be a natural let down from playing its biggest spectacle game of the year — the Whiteout — and following that up with a trip to Evanston to play at 11 a.m. local time in front of a quarter of the crowd. Penn State also has its off week after this game so pressure is on James Franklin to not let his crew look ahead to that. Last year Penn State played Northwestern in a similar spot. Weather had a major impact but the Lions turned the ball over a ton in what was a total clunker of the game.  Look Northwestern has a pulse too. I think it’s fair to say that it’s already exceeded expectations and things have to be feeling good after the big mess of July. I watched the Rutgers game and caught portions of last weekend’s Minnesota game including the final tying touchdown drive and overtime. The Wildcats looked remarkably improved. INU: Give us a score prediction — who wins and why (or more specifically will Penn State cover and why)? BB: Before I do that I feel compelled to mention my love for Northwestern University. After all I am a 2006 graduate - Masters in Journalism. Woo Medill. I must also note that Talor Battle is my favorite Penn State basketball player ever. So I hope for another fine season for Talor Boo Buie and Brooks Barnhizer — who I coached against when he was in high school. I realize that I’ve actually picked Penn State NOT to cover every game this season and they have in fact covered. So inevitably I’m going to look silly when the Wildcats beat the spread. Here’s word-for-word my prediction from our site:  In 2017 Penn State was unbeaten and headed to Evanston for an 11 a.m. local start ahead of its bye week. The Lions overwhelmed the Wildcats leading 10-0 at the half and 24-0 at the end of three quarters. By the end Penn State had its backups on the field for a painless 31-7 win. It’s the exact kind of win that Penn State has patented thus far in 2023. I’m a believer in history and I think it’s a similar Saturday for the Lions this weekend. I think the Wildcats put up more yards than Iowa did (how can’t you?) and they’ll spread the ball around and get it out quickly much the same way that West Virginia and Illinois tried to do earlier this year. But Penn State also adjusts and comes away with a turnover or two from quarterback Ben Bryant. I’m also calling my shot that Penn State comes away with at least one 50+ yard touchdown run against a defense that has given up some big plays.

Share this story After finishing in the top five in their season-opening meet the Wildcats headed back to Illinois with a lot of optimism for the future. After their second meet of the year it sure seems like that optimism was well worth it. Northwestern finished sixth overall in the 14-team Windon Memorial Classic in Northfield Illinois earlier this week. The Wildcats put two players in the top 10 at the meet and if the rest of the team can step up their play the ‘Cats will be a formidable opponent all year long.  The meet had an extremely auspicious beginning for Northwestern. The squad raced out to a 13-under 271 in the first round a mark that put them just two strokes back of eventual winner Purdue which shot 269 on the opening day. Four different Wildcats — sophomores Ethan Tseng and Daniel Svärd junior Cameron Adam and graduate student James Imai — all shot two under par or better on the first day with Tseng and Imai both shooting four-under 67s putting them in a tie for fourth after Day One. Day Two saw another impressive performance from the ‘Cats. While the score slightly regressed to a nine-under 275 three different players still managed to shoot under par. Tseng playing the meet of his life shot a blistering 5-under 66 to lead the team and first-year Niall Shields-Donegan had the best round of his collegiate career with a 2-under 69. The rest of the pack played better on the second day as well but come day’s end Northwestern was still sitting in a tie for third seven strokes back of Purdue. It was in the third round that the Wildcats’ team came back to earth a little bit. After three scores in the 60s on both of the first two days Northwestern put up just one in the third and final round of the meet. Adam’s score of 69 and Tseng’s 70 were enough to salvage an even-par 284 for the day but that score was only good enough for seventh on the day. Worst of all of the six teams ahead of Northwestern four were either behind the Wildcats or just barely ahead when the day began. The end result was an impressive 22-under 830 that was still only good enough for a disappointing sixth-place finish. However the team clearly showed that it could compete in any meet this year with four players going under par. The leader of that pack was of course Tseng. The sophomore went under par in all three rounds including the team-best 66 in Round Two en route to a 10-under 203 for the meet. The end result for Tseng was a tie for fourth overall at the meet six spots behind Purdue’s Herman Sekne (who set a course record) and just two spots behind Drew Salyers the runner-up from Indiana. The meet was a huge boost for Tseng who is getting a chance to show what he can do after limited action last year. Adam also earned a spot in the top 10 thanks to his brilliantly consistent play. After an opening round 68 he carded back-to-back 69s to finish at 7-under with a total score of 206. The junior who finished tied for 15th in the season-opening meet has now placed in the top 15 at both meets so far this year the only Wildcat to do so. After Tseng and Adam the rest of the squad put up a very solid performance. Svärd coming off a Big Ten Freshman of the Year debut season had his best round in the opener and struggled in the next two but still finished with a 1-under 212 for the meet. Imai did Svärd one better finishing with a total of just 211 for the meet. As for Shields-Donegan the freshman he was just four over par for the meet with a 217 a nice improvement from his eight-over par debut earlier in September. Individual play saw a lot less success for Northwestern. The three competitors in individual play senior Christopher Zhang sophomore Akshay Anand and first year Jeremy Chen combined for just one round at even par for the entire meet — Zhang’s 71 in the final round. None of the three finished better than 3-over par and Zhang whose 216 was the best individual effort finished tied for 63rd. However the team play will be the key for Northwestern this year so the individual play struggles aren’t too much of a worry yet. Now that the season is really kicking into gear it will be a quick turnaround for the team. Their next meet will involve a jaunt to South Bend Indiana to take part in the Fighting Irish Classic hosted by Notre Dame on Sunday. Northwestern will look to make sure its opponents which include Big Ten foes Iowa and Indiana go back from whence they came without finishing in the top five. One of those spots ideally will be held by the Wildcats.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Coming off an exhilarating come-from-behind victory against Minnesota the ‘Cats were at home again this weekend taking on No. 6 Penn State. Northwestern got off to an  encouraging start and went into the locker room after the first half all square at 10-10. But things came crashing down in the second half. Here’s whose stock is up and whose took a hit in the loss. Stock Up Special Teams and A.J. Henning The game got off to a good start for the ‘Cats when sophomore special teamer Braydon Brus forced a fumble on the opening kickoff setting up the offense with prime field position inside the red zone. Northwestern failed to capitalize for six but kicker Jack Olsen booted a 33-yard field goal through the uprights to give Northwestern an early 3-0 lead. It was the first time Penn State trailed this season. Henning also finally somewhat broke a return off at the tail end of the first quarter for 36 yards. He then had a 15-yard punt return early in the second. The ‘Cats needed every advantage they could find in this one and the special teams unit had an impact early. Run defense The ‘Cats forced a punt on Penn State’s opening drive and held PSU to a field goal on the next drive in large part because they actually did a decent job slowing down the Lions’ two-headed monster of a running back room. Nicholas Singleton had just 23 yards on the ground on those two drives and Kaytron Allen had only eight. Altogether Penn State had 67 rush yards in the first half on 3.7 yards per carry. For all the criticism this Northwestern defensive line has faced thus far it was an encouraging start for that unit. Early in the second half the line also held up on a goal line stand until fourth down when it finally caved on a sneak. Things devolved from there but in this case a moral victory is reasonable. The Northwestern run defense which has previously looked only abysmal played a good half of football and a decent game overall against one of the best rushing attacks in the nation. Cam Johnson Johnson was the ‘Cats’ leading receiver in this one and he got started early. The Arizona State transfer had three catches for 50 yards just in the first half. His 22-yard reception in enemy territory set the ‘Cats up for an eventual touchdown in the second quarter to give them a 10-3 lead.  Johnson was a factor in the offense even as things started to go awry in the second half catching a couple more passes and contributing the Northwestern’s minimal ball movement. He finished with five receptions on eight targets for 74 yards. Johnson is emerging as NU’s most consistent receiver and it was nice to see him put up real stats against a defense as good as Penn State’s.  Honorable mentions: Garnett Hollis Jr. Xander Mueller the TV timeout field goal kicking game winner Stock Down Offensive line play Ben Bryant was on his butt a lot in this one as Penn State’s vaunted defensive line had its way with Northwestern’s offensive front. The Nittany Lions had four sacks just in the first half one of which seemingly resulted in a leg injury for Bryant. He was twisted down awkwardly after a missed block from Josh Priebe but stayed in the game in some discomfort. The NU QB went down again early in the fourth quarter after a sack Penn State’s fifth of the afternoon. The big guys up front didn’t support the run game well either. Cam Porter was only able to muster 18 yards on the ground and Northwestern had 45 rush yards as a team. It’s hard to blame the runners for that stat line given the lack of running lanes and Northwestern’s inability to win at the line of scrimmage. The ‘Cats couldn’t even convert a quarterback sneak behind this offensive line. The Bryant to Bryce Kirtz connection After an electrifying performance in the second half last week Bryant came back down to earth against a dominant Penn State defense. Before his injury Bryant was 14-25 for 122 yards and no scores. Kirtz also saw a major dip in production after his 215-yard performance against Minnesota. He caught just three passes for 12 yards and wasn’t particularly noticeable. Defensively Minnesota and Penn State are two very different matchups and expectations were too high after just one game of elite throwing and catching. Nevertheless the two were not as effective as last weekend and this isn’t necessarily a connection ‘Cats fans can feel confident about week in and week out. Staying ahead of the chains Northwestern faced a lot of third-and-longs in this one for a variety of reasons. Sacks hurt. Penalties hurt. Weird play calling hurt. But whatever the issues were Northwestern was inexcusably behind the chains all day. It’s hard to establish offensive rhythm when you constantly have to drive the ball a long way to move the sticks. Struggling to move the ball on Penn State is understandable but the ‘Cats’ performance on early downs didn’t give them much of a chance. They need to generate more third and manageable’s as the season continues or the offense will continue to stall. Honorable mentions: Fourth down decisions A.J.

Share this story Well we will always have the first half. Northwestern (2-3 1-2 B1G) fell to No. 6 Penn State (5-0 3-0 B1G) 41-13 on Saturday afternoon. The ‘Cats found themselves tied 10-10 at halftime but were unable to hang with the sixth-ranked Nittany Lions for the full 60 minutes. Ben Bryant led the NU offense going 14-for-25 for 122 yards and a rushing touchdown before leaving the game in the third quarter with an upper-body injury. Cam Johnson had six catches for 81 yards but the Wildcats’ offensive line surrendered six sacks. Nicholas Singleton had 80 rushing yards as well as 39 receiving yards and two scores on the day for the Nittany Lions. Drew Allar was 18-of-33 for 189 and a touchdown. On the opening play of the game Jack Olsen squibbed the ball down to PSU’s 10-yard line. Singleton scooped it up but coughed it up after a big hit from Brayden Bus who also recovered it to set NU up in the red zone. However the Wildcats’ offense was unable to do anything with the ball going backwards. Olsen connected on a 33-yard field goal to make it 3-0 Wildcats early. The Nittany Lions took over after a touchback. On third-and-one Drew Aller pushed the ball ahead on a QB sneak for a fresh set of downs. On the next set of downs the Wildcats were able to get of the field after KeAndre Lambert-Smith could not coral the checkdown pass from Aller on third down. NU’s offense did not do a single thing against the stout Penn State defense. Ben Bryant got walloped on first down to send Northwestern backward three yards. On the ensuing plays a toss to Cam Porter and a screen to Bryce Kirtz sent the punting unit out for the Wildcats. Through two drives the ‘Cats had negative two yards. Starting just before midfield Penn State looked to its tandem of running backs of Singleton and Kaytron Allen to lead the offense. The duo picked up an easy first down but the ‘Cats’ defense held and forced at fourth-and-one. A false start penalty pushed the Nittany Lions back five yards but Aller found Dante Cephas for 15 yards and a new set of downs. PSU worked the ball all the way down to the three but Allar missed Theo Johnson in the corner of the end zone forcing the Nittany Lions to settle for three. Alex Felkins booted through the 20-yard attempt to even the game at 3-3. On the ensuing kickoff A.J. Henning ran the ball all the way to the 40-yard line but had to come off the field due to an injury. After falling behind to second-and-21 Bryant located Cam Johnson for 18 yards and Cam Porter got just enough to pick up the first down. At the end of the first quarter the ‘Cats and Nittany Lions were all knotted up at three. The ‘Cats stalled at midfield and Hunter Renner sent the ball back to PSU at its own 11-yard line. The Nittany Lions picked up a first down but the ball came loose at the end of the play; however PSU fell on it. On the next set of downs  Carmine Bastone forced Allar to throw the ball away and Rod Heard II blew up a screen to make it third-and-11. On third down Allar’s pass fell incomplete and PSU had to punt it away. Henning fielded the punt and picked up 15 yards on the return his longest as a Wildcat. ""After the return Bryant found Johnson on an RPO and Porter spun his way into Nittany Lions territory and to move the chains. However another PSU sack pushed NU back 10 yards. On third-and-16 Bryant checked it down to Porter and No. 4 did the rest. Porter cut and weaved his way through the Penn State defense and got just enough for a first down. An offsides penalty made it first-and-five and Bryant kept it himself to move the chains. Bryant and Johnson continued to be in sync as they hooked up again for a 21-yard catch and run all the way to the PSU three-yard line. Bryant with a push from the backfield punched the ball in from a yard out and NU took a 10-3 lead with nearly six minutes left in the half."" The Penn State offense more specifically Allar could do not anything on the ensuing possession. The PSU QB missed two straight throws including one that was tipped by Richie Haggarty to send the punting unit out once again. The ‘Cats offense also could not do anything going three-and-out and punting it right back to PSU. In a temp offense the Nittany Lions started to click. Allar found Lambert-Smith for a 25-yard catch and run and Singleton took a check down for 13 yards to reach the edge of the red zone. After Penn State picked up another first down Trey Potts took a handoff and scampered into the end zone from 13 yards out to tie the game at 10-10 with a minute left in the half. NU went three-and-out and gave the Nittany Lions the ball at midfield with a minute to go; however the Wildcats defense was ready. Ore Adeyi drove on the football and broke up a first-down pass from Allar and Anto Saka knocked the ball out of Allar’s hands but the QB was able to recover it to end the first half. As both teams headed to the locker room the score remained even. While the score was tied the Wildcats struggled to move the ball. NU had 59 yards of total offense in the first half compared to PSU’s 158 yards. Bryant was sacked four times while Allar had been brought down just once. NU got the ball to begin the second half but could not do anything with it once again going three-and-out. The Nittany Lions were able to move the ball all the way into the red zone thanks to a 35-yard catch and run by Lambert-Smith. An Allar scramble and defensive holding made it first-and-goal for PSU and after three plays falling short of the end zone Allar lunged across the goal line for the touchdown and gave PSU its first lead of the day at 17-10. After falling behind the sticks third-and-15 Bryant scrambled out of the pocket but gave himself up just inches short of the marker. The ‘Cats decided to go for it on fourth down but Bryant’s sneak attempt came up short giving the ball to PSU at NU’s 31. The Wildcats’ defense held after the sudden change but the Nittany Lions expanded its lead to 20-10. The ‘Cats offense was once again overwhelmed by the pass rush as the Nittany Lions forced another three-and-out. Trying anything to stay on the field NU attempted a fake punt but Mangieri was stopped short of the line to gain and set up Penn State inside Northwestern territory once again. PSU drove right down the field and Allar connected with Singleton to expand the Nittany Lions’ lead to 27-10. On the next drive Bryant found Johnson on a slant for a first down NU’s first fresh set of downs in the second half. The next play a taunting penalty on Penn State gave the Wildcats a free 15 yards and a 17-yard reception by Thomas Gordon put NU on the end of the red zone entering the final frame. On the first two plays of the fourth quarter Porter and Johnson worked the ball inside the 10-yard line and Kirtz brought the ball all the way to the Nittany Lions’ three. However at the one-yard line Bryant was blown up on a play action being sacked all the way back at the 10-yard line and needing medical help to get off the field. Olsen connected on a 28-yard attempt to cut the ‘Cats’ deficit to 27-13.  The Nittany Lions had to punt the ball away. and Brendan Sullivan came in to take over for the injured Bryant. Sullivan did not do anything running for his life on every play. To make matters even worse Hunter Renner whiffed on a punt sending it only 22 yards. Lambert-Smith added another first-down reception and PSU converted on another third-down to get inside the red zone. A holding penalty pushed Penn State behind the 20 but a catch and run by Tyler Warren made it a third-and-three inside the 10 and Singleton converted PSU’s third straight third down. On the next play Singleton punched it in to put the game out of reach 34-13. In garbage time Sullivan had a nice 18-yard scramble to pick up a first down but followed it up immediately by throwing it directly to Daequan Hardy. On the ensuing plays with all the backups in Beau Pribula connected on a 30-yard pass to Potts for a walk-in touchdown and PSU closed out the game with a 41-13 victory.

Share this story Last week only one Inside NU staffer correctly predicted Northwestern to take down the Minnesota Golden Gophers. What do our writers say about today’s game with No. 6 Penn State? Let’s just say: not a ton of faith in the Wildcats. Iggy Dowling: Penn State 45 Northwestern 10 Last week was good. Penn State is better. Much much much better. Bradley Locker: Penn State 37 Northwestern 7 A Brendan Sullivan garbage time touchdown to get Northwestern on the board seems like a lock. David Gold: Penn State 45 Northwestern 10 This is going to get ugly. The ‘Cats have given up over 200 rushing yards in their last two days and Penn State has two of the best backs in the country. On the defensive side the Nittany Lions have 11 players with sacks already so NU’s offensive line will have its hands full on Saturday morning.  Ethan Segall: Penn State 31 Northwestern 14 Good teams win great teams cover. The ‘Cats come into this game undefeated at Ryan Field but the Nittany Lions are on a mission. This however hurt my feelings: James Franklin said the team wasn’t blasting music at practice today like they usually do because he wanted them prepared for the environment at Northwestern. The Wildcats are averaging 17500 fans at Ryan Field this season Adam Beck: Penn State: 42 Northwestern 14 Penn State’s defense and run game completely dictate things as Northwestern crashes back down to reality. Don’t count out an early Jack Lausch rushing touchdown giving Northwestern some false hope and a Ben Bryant to A.J. Henning second-half score to make it three straight weeks the pair have linked up for six. Natalie Wells: Penn State 38 Northwestern 10 NU’s offensive line simply won’t hold up against the Nittany Lions’ pass rush. Led by Chop Robinson Penn State’s defense should put constant pressure on Ben Bryant. Last week saw Bryant come up limping multiple times so his mobility is something to keep an eye on. It was an amazing feat to beat Minnesota but the ‘Cats will have no such luck against an exponentially tougher opponent. Ascher Levin: Penn State 28 Northwestern 14 After a truly remarkable comeback win Northwestern is taking on No. 6 Penn State. The Nittany Lions have a great running back duo in Kaytron Allen and Nicholas Singleton. While the Wildcats pulled off an improbable win last week they allowed 244 rushing yards. Northwestern will have to clean that up if it wants to have a chance to win. Ben Bryant was incredible in the fourth quarter and overtime after Northwestern’s offense went up-tempo; however Penn State has allowed an average of under nine points per game to its opponents this year. The Wildcats will need to have another great game from Bryant and the offense to keep pace with the Nittany Lions. Penn State is the best team that Northwestern has faced this year and PSU will come out on top against the Wildcats. Noah Poser: Penn State 37 Northwestern 12 Me myself and I alone picked Northwestern to win last weekend and I was on an island. Living on island time was nice but unfortunately it’s back to the real world this weekend for both myself and the Wildcats. In the real world Penn State is coming to town. Something else about the real world is that here: you don’t always get what you want. That is unless you’re Penn State and you want a win against Northwestern. In that case ask and you shall receive! Ashleigh Provoost: Penn State 45 Northwestern 6 It’s not a matter of if Northwestern wins or loses but a matter of how much the team is going to get crushed by. Especially after watching the Wildcats’ performance against other strong teams I’m going for the more cynical approach this week. Patrick Winograd: Penn State 38 Northwestern 14 Penn State is just too dominant for Northwestern to stop. This is not the same offense that Minnesota walked into Evanston with (which despite the loss still put up 34 points). It is a much better O. Penn State’s balance offensively and ability to create turnovers will turn into a lot of points put up on the board in a hurry. While Northwestern showed signs of improvement on offense last weekend Penn State has given up a combined 13 points in its two conference games against Illinois and Iowa. Northwestern outscoring both of those teams’ combined effort would actually go down as a positive so despite how lopsided my score might be I’d like to call myself an optimist about this week. John Olsen: Penn State 35 Northwestern 7 Unfortunately it’s the ‘Cats’ destiny to lose this weekend. You’d have to go back to 2004 to find the last time they managed to topple an AP Top 10 opponent at Ryan Field with an actual crowd in the stands.

Share this story Around 12:30 p.m. Saturday a Google search result (likely) peaked: When’s the last time Northwestern football has beaten a top-10 opponent? For nearly one-and-a-half hours on a sunny day from Evanston Northwestern wasn’t just avoiding a total beatdown at the hands of No. 6 Penn State; in fact the Wildcats were tied with one of the best teams in the country. The ‘Cats forced PSU’s first turnover in five games on the literal first play of the game; became the first opponent to lead Penn State in over 16 quarters of football; and had the Nittany Lion offense totally out of sorts. As history wrote it it wasn’t in the cards for NU to ultimately emerge with what would’ve been maybe the most improbable win in all of college football this year. Penn State outscored the Wildcats 31-3 in the second half finding more offensive mojo while stifling the home offense for virtually 60 minutes. While final 41-13 score seems to indicate that one of the best programs in the nation came into Ryan Field — where around 80% of fans donned its colors — and dominated a futile squad that was anything but the case. Truthfully the fact that Northwestern even had a chance in this game was remarkable given how spotless the Nittany Lions had looked in every facet through a third of their season not to mention the talent discrepancy between the two sides. On Saturday afternoon the ‘Cats mustered only 175 total yards the fewest for the purple and white since taking on Michigan in October of 2015. PSU got home to Ben Bryant and Brendan Sullivan on nearly every snap either flushing the quarterback from the pocket or bringing him down for a sack which happened seven times. Point blank almost nobody would think a team could emerge victorious based on that level of defense fortitude and offensive slog — and yet Northwestern was well within striking distance. The primary reason for the unexpected nature of Saturday’s clash was just how effectively Northwestern’s defense played against an offense that has scored 30+ points in every game. Again the ultimate score indicates differently but the Wildcats got good defensive line penetration filled gaps from the linebacker spot and really never allowed Drew Allar & Co. to hum as usual. Star running backs Nick Singleton and Kaytron Allen combined for 27 carries for 107 yards and the Nittany Lions had just three plays over 20 yards — with one occurring in garbage time. One could certainly attribute the tight contest due to Penn State’s offensive miscues especially errant throws from Allar who posted just 183 yards and completed under 55% of his passes. Unequivocally though how Northwestern played in this game comes back to its new head coach: David Braun. Through five games the fact that NU already has two wins and a real chance to sit at .500 entering its bye is more than almost anyone prognosticated. Under Braun’s leadership the Wildcats have displayed stretches of legitimate defensive aptitude the ability to hang around in games an aggressive mindset and maybe most critically trust that Northwestern can compete with anyone — something which has been sorely lacking for the last two years. “The expectation wasn’t just to make it a good game or protect stats” Braun said postgame. “We were going to make decisions based on trying to find a way to win this football game.” Admittedly Braun made some questionable calls (maybe even for Chargers head coach Brandon Staley) which proved detrimental in his team’s chances to win. By going for it twice on fourth down from his own 31 it generated 10 rather easy points for Penn State — at which point the matchup was firmly in control of the visitors. While those two tide-turning plays dissipated a considerable portion of purple momentum they’re calls from someone who’s playing with a tangible goal of winning and with nothing to lose. Ultimately that translates beyond one afternoon and reflects Braun’s attributes as a coach. In many facets Saturday’s outcome went as expected with a lopsided final score and a bitter taste left in the mouths of Northwestern fans. The Wildcats created almost no pressure on Allar were woeful on offense against one of the country’s most formidable defenses and couldn’t maintain the same level of intensity in the second half. But it’s hard to view a game against No. 6 Penn State in a vacuum. Instead examining the results from a broader lens reveals a Northwestern team that’s embodied the attitude of a fearless first-year head coach whose squad is undoubtedly trending upward — underscoring a unit making tangible progress even when cutting its teeth against one of the marquee programs in America. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story It would be an understatement to say that Northwestern women’s swimming and diving has not had it easy these past few months. In addition to finishing 28th at the 2023 NCAA Championships the team’s worst finish since 2016 the Wildcats were hit with loss after loss as their season concluded. Just a week before NCAAs Jasmine Nocentini Northwestern’s best swimmer and one of the top sprinters in the nation entered the transfer portal for her fifth year of eligibility — eventually opting to transfer to three-time defending national champion Virginia. Then in the offseason NCAA Championship qualifiers Jamie Brennan and Hannah Brunzell made their way to the Pac-12 (or should I say ACC?) transferring to Stanford and Cal respectively while 2023 Second-Team All-American diver Jaye Patrick opted to use her fifth year at Purdue and NCAA qualifier Lola Mull entered the portal but didn’t end up on another team’s roster this season. Around the same time it was announced that NCAA qualifier Ashley Strouse would medically redshirt the 2023-24 season. And as the cherry on top 2024 recruit and recently-crowned World Junior Champion Kate Hurst flipped her commitment from Northwestern to Texas — had she stayed she would have gone down as arguably one of the greatest incoming recruits that this team has ever had. Even if transfers redshirts or retirements aren’t factored in Northwestern still loses big because of passing time — Miriam Guevara the one swimmer on the team who scored individually at NCAAs last season graduated. And that’s not to mention that the ‘Cats are experiencing several coaching changes this season which includes the departure of head coach Katie Robinson who left her position after three seasons to become the associate head coach at Stanford. In place for her will be former Arizona State assistant Rachel Stratton-Mills. However despite the losses Northwestern still has a promising future. The team has the No. 15 ranked recruiting class in the nation according to SwimSwam.com and there are several swimmers on the roster who made tremendous strides last season and will look to continue their momentum. The first season of the Stratton-Mills era might be a rebuilding one but it’s one to be positive about. The first half of Northwestern’s 2022-23 season was all about Nocentini. She captured attention starting from the very first meet of the season with her prowess in both sprint freestyle and breaststroke — a rare form of versatility. At the Purdue Invitational in November 2022 Nocentini posted Big Ten-leading times in the 50-yard freestyle and 100-yard breaststroke (at the end of the season her times in both events still remained top three in the conference) and she also helped Northwestern hit NCAA Championship qualification times in several relays. However the Purdue Invite was the last the ‘Cats saw of Nocentini as per SwimSwam she came down with a shoulder injury and was ruled out for the Big Ten and NCAA Championships. Following her injury the Wildcats dropped out of the top 25 in both SwimSwam and CSCAA’s power rankings after having been ranked top 20 for the majority of the season. Later when she entered the transfer portal she was named by SwimSwam as the top-ranked transfer of the offseason. Even though Nocentini was the most recognizable name on the NU’s roster last season the team had many other success stories. It had six individual NCAA qualifiers (Brennan Guavera Strouse Lola Mull Jaye Patrick and Marie Hopkins) and Guavera and Patrick both earned All-American honors by placing top 16 in their events. Guevara who was 12th in the 100 butterfly and 16th in the 200 butterfly swam a time of 50.91 in the former event to break the Northwestern team record. Strouse who underwent surgery after the 2021-22 season was swimming personal-best times in her primary events for the first time since 2019. Beyond those who qualified for NCAAs individually the ‘Cats had many other swimmers who impressed. Sprinters Ally Larson Lindsay Ervin and Audrey Yu were major contributors to Northwestern relays with Ervin and Yu having been first-years. Although Brunzell didn’t qualify for NCAAs she scored 48 points at Big Tens which was the third-most on her team. At the end of the season the Wildcats’ performances culminated in a sixth-place finish at Big Tens and a 28th-place finish at NCAAs. By contrast they finished fifth at Big Tens and 18th at NCAAs the year prior.  Northwestern might be losing all of its individual NCAA swimming qualifiers from last season but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have championship-caliber talent on its squad. That’s because the Wildcats gain a massive fifth-year transfer to their roster this year — six-time NCAA All-American Ayla Spitz from California. Spitz a mid-distance freestyler who’s also good at backstroke is the only swimmer on the ‘Cats’ roster who has ever put up individual NCAA points in her career (which happens by placing top 16 in an event). She was not at her best during NCAAs last season and didn’t score but has finished as high as fifth individually back in 2021. Her best times in the 200 freestyle (1:44.10) 500 freestyle (4:38.05) and 200 backstroke (1:53.21) are team-leading times for Northwestern and the former two times would both be worthy of scoring at 2023 NCAAs. In addition her 500 free time also would have been fast enough to win Big Tens last year — which is significant considering that the ‘Cats have only produced one Big Ten women’s swimming champion since 2008. Spitz also posted the fastest time on Cal’s fourth-place finishing 800 freestyle relay last season which makes her a big boost for Northwestern’s version of that relay. In other words look for Spitz to be the star of the team this season. She’s only here for a year but she will be the one to count on the most when it comes to putting points on the board. Junior Justine Murdock also brings in NCAA Championship experience. She did not qualify individually for the meet last season but her best time of 1:53.62 in the 200 backstroke set two seasons prior gave her a 2022 NCAAs berth. Her personal best sits less than a second away from what it took to score in the 200 back last season so she’s not that far from being an individual contributor if she returns to top form. Murdock’s best times in the 50 and 100 back are very similar to Spitz’s so these two will be competing to be Northwestern’s designated backstroke leg on both the 200 and 400 medley relays. Another group worth mentioning is the Northwestern sprint freestyle group which is headlined by sophomores Yu and Ervin. Ervin traveled to NCAAs last season as a relay-only swimmer helping the Cats’ finish 16th in 200 and 400 freestyle relays. Yu was not at NCAAs but her 21.87 50 freestyle relay split from the team’s meet against Purdue and Minnesota was the fastest 50 free split that anyone on the team not named Nocentini had produced. With best times of 22.23 and 48.66 in the 50 and 100 free respectively Ervin comes into this season as the fastest sprint freestyler on the roster — which is one of the most important roles in swimming as sprinters have to contribute on several relays in addition to their individual swims. Her times also make her just a few tenths from individual NCAAs qualification. Diver Markie Hopkins who is returning for a fifth year is also one to watch for. She’s quite literally the only returning qualifier on this team which automatically makes her an important piece. Last year she was just one place away from scoring by finishing 17th in the ten-meter diving event. And what about the freshmen who were ranked No. 15 as a class in the nation? Three names to look out for include Sydney Smith Maggie Papnicholas Audrey J-Cheng and May Peterson. Smith has a best time of 1:46.21 in the 200 free which is faster than any returning swimmer on the Cats’ roster while Peterson’s 100 and 200 backstroke times (53.65/1:56.99) are similar to Murdock’s bests coming out of high school (54.36/1:56.48) — given Murdock’s improvement trajectory in Evanston Peterson has a lot of potential. Papnicholas who was named a “Best Of The Rest” recruit by SwimSwam as well as J-Cheng both have 100 and 200 breaststroke times faster than any returning swimmers on the team. In the Wildcats’ first season under Stratton-Mills expectations should be low. They’ve lost almost everything that has made their team good for the last few years so their job this year is simply to make the most out of what they have and see improvement. However it’s important to reiterate that just because this team has lost a lot does not mean they are falling apart. They have a reliable star in Spitz who can make a national impact a handful of other swimmers with NCAA qualification potential as well as a promising freshman class. Will this group of swimmers help NU get ranked again? Maybe maybe not it’s too early to tell. Either way they are worth looking forward to. When it comes to Big Ten competition the Wildcats will be fighting in the middle of the pack. They don’t have the depth or the star power to take down top-25 teams like Michigan Wisconsin Ohio State and Indiana in championship meets but they are considerably better than bottom-tier teams like Rutgers Illinois Iowa Penn State and Nebraska. Expect them to be battling it out for fifth place at Big Tens with Minnesota who beat them for fifth by 59 points last season. At NCAAs the best-case scenario I see for Northwestern would be a fringe top-25 finish. If Spitz can score double-digit points individually other swimmers step up and a few relays place top 16 that should be enough (last year Texas A&M finished 25th with just 26 points). However it’s also entirely possible that the Wildcats score zero NCAA points. The Wildcats begin their season on October 13 in an away meet against Cincinnati. Mark your calendars!

Share this story After an impressive showing against Big Ten competition at the Badger Classic in Madison on Sept. 9 Northwestern found itself ranked No. 29 in the nation by the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches’ Association. Three weeks later it has some ground to make up. The Wildcats got their first taste of elite national competition in Charlottesville Virginia on Sept. 23 as they took part in the Virginia Invitational. Of the 23 teams that raced at UVA’s Panorama Farms nine had finished 2022 as top-17 squads in the nation. Because the NCAA Championships will be held there in November it’s likely that many elite teams wanted to familiarize themselves with the hilly course to identify potential training and tactical areas of improvement to address in the weeks leading up to postseason racing. As one of the slower teams in the field there were two storylines to watch for the ‘Cats that Saturday: how they would fare against Midwest Regional rival Iowa State and how they’d compare to their Big Ten foes. Overall Northwestern got a mixed bag of results. Heading into the race ranked No. 26 nationally and No. 2 in the Midwest — marginally ahead of NU — the Cyclones blew the ‘Cats away. Iowa State moved up as a team throughout the 5K race never losing points at each kilometer mark. Four ISU runners finished before Northwestern could even bring two across the line which made a resounding statement that Amy Rudolph’s team may be closer to national No. 3 and Midwest No. 1 Oklahoma State than it is to Northwestern. Taking down multiple national contenders Iowa State finished sixth overall in Charlottesville and proceeded to jump up 14 spots in the following week’s USTFCCCA poll all the way to No. 12. Why focus on ISU before Northwestern? Its jaw-dropping performance all but guaranteed that an auto-bid to the NCAAs will not be available for the ‘Cats as it was in 2022. The top two teams in each region lock up those berths and the dominance of the Cyclones and Cowgirls indicates that NU will likely need to set its sights on one of the 13 at-large bids available. It makes meets against great competition even more important. Without third-year and NCAA qualifier Anna Hightower in the lineup Northwestern managed. Katherine Hessler had a huge day as she nearly beat her 5K best on the track with a 17:04 time on the grass and a 45th-place finish. Behind Hessler Ava Earl put up a 17:20 and first-year Anna Delgado dropped a 17:22 to finish 66th and 69th respectively. Delgado’s race was especially impressive because she stuck with Hessler beyond the 3K mark and was the seventh-fastest first-year in the entire field. To round out the top five Maddy Whitman and Kalea Bartolotto ran 17:33 and 17:40 while Adele Magaud and Fiona Lenth finished right behind those two. All in all it was good for 14th in the field. Technically the ‘Cats finished in a tie with Elon but lost out because three of its top five runners finished higher than Northwestern’s. On the bright side NU did edge out Ohio State by 10 points. Some nice finishing kicks from Hessler (who picked up 10 spots in the last kilometer) and Earl (who passed eight runners) probably helped. While the Buckeyes had much more top-end talent with reigning Big Ten champion Addie Engel and All-Big Ten First-Teamer Daniella Santos in the fold NU’s back scorers made the difference. That fact was encouraging especially considering NU was without Hightower. However the race revealed that Northwestern needs a little more starpower at the top of its lineup to ensure that a second consecutive NCAA berth is in the cards. In 2022 Bartolotto typically formed a great one-two punch with the recently graduated Rachel McCardell but she was Northwestern’s fifth finisher at UVA. Hessler had a great race but some more consistent support up top (and potentially above her) could go a long way.  The following week Northwestern fell out of the national top 30. After heading home it looked to move back in the right direction on Sept. 29 when it took a quick drive down Sheridan Road to participate in the Loyola Lakefront Invitational. Although it was local for the ‘Cats they faced legitimate competition there; Wisconsin Ohio State Indiana Michigan and some other teams from around the country made the trip. Once again there were ups and downs for Northwestern. Hessler had another terrific showing throwing down a massive 6K personal best with a 20:12. She ended up taking 16th with Bartolotto coming through 15 seconds after her in 26th.  As the third scorer on the team Lenth had a huge day. She not only broke the 21-minute barrier with her 20:41 she also shattered the 22-minute mark for the first time. Lenth actually came through the 5K mark in 33rd just seven seconds off her track personal best in that event but fell back eight spots in the last kilometer to finish 41st. Delgado trailed her by six seconds while Earl Magaud and Boler rounded out the top seven. Northwestern finished smack in the middle of the 16-school field as the eighth-place team. It narrowly lost to the Buckeyes and the Wolverines which beat Jill Miller’s squad by 26 and 21 points respectively. NU’s back scorers beat Ohio State’s but the Santos-Engel duo proved to be too strong with the support of Akemi Von Scherr snagging a solid 29th as OSU’s No. 3. On the other hand Michigan didn’t dominate Northwestern up top but had much more depth at its three-through-five spots. That result demonstrates that Northwestern is going to need the scorers from last year’s NCAA-qualifying lineup to race really well on the same day in order to beat those two teams at the Big Ten Championships in a couple of weeks. If the Wildcats are without Hightower come late October it’s going to be crucial for Bartolotto Earl and Hessler to all establish themselves near the front of the conference and regional title fields or at least in the back of the chase pack. Lenth and Delgado stepping up as high-scorers is encouraging for the team’s long-term depth in the lineup. Ultimately though Northwestern’s score will probably look much better if Earl or Bartolotto end up peaking at the same time as opposed to other runners on the team because those two have shown that they’re capable of finishing in the top 10 of major fields. For NU to write a resume that really wows the Division I Cross Country Subcommittee which is in charge of selecting at-large teams for NCAAs come November that needs to happen at a big meet — and preferably more than once. Northwestern’s last stop before Big Tens on Oct. 27 will be in Peoria where it’ll race at the Bradley Pink Classic on Oct. 13. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Olsen @InvrrtedFB  Oct  2, 2023, 11:10am CDT      / new","Men’s soccer: ‘Cats sit atop the Big Ten standings, extend unbeaten streak to 10 games", The Payne Train™️ can’t be stopped. Share this story Well maybe the doomsayers (me) that crawled out of the woodwork (I was always here) after Northwestern couldn’t convert a 2-0 lead late against Wisconsin into a win 13 days ago were wrong. The luck — if implying it was involved at all wasn’t an inaccurate assertion to begin with — clearly hasn’t run out. It’s at the point where what I’m witnessing every time the ‘Cats step on the field is making me question everything about everything. And I mean everything. They make strategic philosophies in this sport like controlling the ball and territory seem ill-informed. “Is the Cruyffian way dead?” has been a common refrain around the soccer world for the last decade and the Wildcats would be right up there with José Mourinho’s Chelsea Inter Milan and Real Madrid sides as the best examples for answering “yes” to that question.  NU’s general overperformance at both ends of the pitch in the Expected Goals (xG) metric also has me wondering whether the concepts I’ve learned about in statistics classes such as regression to the mean and the Law of Large Numbers are anything more than just theoretical.  The funniest potential explanation for all of this would be the ball being “affected” by “external factors.” And to be fair an abnormally high number of shots have kissed the metal posts and bar holding up the net of the goal behind Jackson Weyman. However I’ll put the tinfoil hat away and go with a more serious interpretation — one that’s grounded in statistical theory. An outlier relative to expectation doesn’t always mean overperformance as the unlikeliness of an extreme outlier occurring under that expectation can be enough to prove the inaccuracy of said expectation.  After all Occam’s Razor says the simplest explanation for a phenomenon is the best. So maybe Northwestern is winning games simply because it is a good team. Sunday Sept. 23 (Evanston Ill.) NU remained unchanged tactically (3-2-5 IP 4-2-3-1 OOP) in its first Big Ten encounter at home of the season. A crucial alteration was made in another department though as the ‘Cats reverted to the all-grays. To this point their record in those uniforms stood at five wins zero draws and zero losses. Whether a result of the attire Northwestern enjoyed a reasonably comfortable victory. As has been the case all season the Wildcats took advantage of attacking transitions and set pieces with the ball and did enough defensively to ensure they weren’t outscored at the other end. One interesting tactical note involved Ohio State’s IP play — which Payne specifically addressed after the game — was how it manipulated NU’s FBs especially in the first half. Usually the Buckeyes were in a 4-2-4 structure but then a FB would push forward and one of the DMs would shift wide and it got a bit messy. Ultimately shape isn’t all that important here but there is one specific movement that is: a well-timed out-to-in arrival by a player starting wider on the ball side. Combined with having a Buckeye to the outside of that player the Wildcat FB there would be forced into a dilemma. Either he follows the narrowing movement leaving the width-holder free or stays and allows the OSU player moving centrally to find space between the lines unmarked. The clip below illustrates this well. The Ohio State LST starts wide timing his movement extremely well relative to the line-breaking pass from the LCB and then uses his first touch to find the free LW as Bryant Mayer at RB had followed the initial run inside. pic.twitter.com/GNntLmb5zt Mayer then goes to close down the Buckeye winger but that opens up the return ball to the striker making an underlapping run. NU is fortunate his curling effort sails just wide of the far post here. To combat this paraphrasing what Payne discussed the ‘Cats got less aggressive with their DMs jumping in these phases of play to provide more half-space coverage. Add a slightly tweaked pressing structure and a shift to a back five in the second period and the Buckeyes’ attacking threat was drastically reduced in the latter stages of the match. Friday Sept. 29 (College Park Md.) Welcome to the Weyman show. Before covering anything else his efforts have to be appreciated. He’s now put in at least three monstrous performances between the sticks this season and has been a consistently assured presence in the box. I honestly had to check multiple times to make sure it wasn’t Miha Miskovic in goal this match in particular because the quality he displayed made it feel like he was. Anyways had you told me before the season started one of the teams would be coming into this one without a loss and the other would only have one win I’d never in my wildest dreams have imagined Northwestern being the former and Maryland the latter. Then had I not known anything about either of these teams and watched the match based on the flow of the game I would’ve been far more likely to say the Terps were the unbeaten side. This match was eerily similar for the Wildcats to their clash with Wisconsin. They were pinned in their own half defending for their lives for large portions of the contest. Additionally on another day Maryland could’ve easily scored three or four much like the Badgers were arguably unlucky to only breach the NU defense twice.  This time though Northwestern managed to hold on to its 2-0 lead and for the first time in his tenure in Evanston Payne overcame his alma mater without extra time or penalties.  One last note: Despite the levels of pressure they applied to the Wildcat back line the most fight the Terrapins showed was when the clock was stopped. It’s pretty emblematic of their frustration to have an incident like this flare up in the final minutes because Weyman appeared to recreate the Allen Iverson-Tyronn Lue stepover after getting fouled coming for a cross. pic.twitter.com/4XTQpbTb3u A smaller confrontation appeared to occur after the final whistle but exactly what happened isn’t clear based on the broadcast feed. What is clear however is it prompted the Northwestern GK to do a shushing motion before kissing the school logo on his jersey twice while leaving the field. pic.twitter.com/75nwoIv6g3 Never a dull moment with this team is there?

There were plenty of blowouts and no noteworthy comebacks. The top teams won again. The teams at the bottom of the Big Ten barrel continued to show why they’re there. One wide receiver may have elevated his name into the  national conversation. Meanwhile two middle-of the-pack teams collected key wins to stay afloat. All that and more on this week’s edition of Around the Big Ten. Penn State Michigan and Maryland score big road wins to move to 5-0 We have talked ad nauseam about each of these teams and we’re going to talk about them some more! Each had blowout victories over the bottom of the Big Ten on Saturday. Penn State got the day started with a 41-13 win over Northwestern. The Nittany Lions started slow and the game was tied at 10 at the half but they came out firing in the second half and eventually blew out the Wildcats as expected. Michigan followed that up with an absolutely dominant display in Lincoln. They ran the Huskers out of their own sold-out stadium 45-7 in a game that wasn’t as close as the score would indicate. For the first time all season they looked like the Michigan team everyone has been waiting all year to see. Maryland then wrapped up the day for this trio with a blowout victory of its own. The Terrapins rocked Indiana 44-17 in Bloomington behind Taulia Tagovailoa’s 352 yards and five touchdowns through the air. The win sets them up for a big game next Saturday when they take on fellow undefeated Ohio State in Columbus. It’s the first of many big games in the Big Ten East this season. Purdue and Iowa collect key conference victories The Boilermakers steamrolled Illinois 44-19 on Saturday to help get their season back on track. Purdue starting quarterback Hudson Card played clean football finishing 18-of-26 for 217 yards and two touchdowns while the rushing attack performed like a high-speed locomotive to the tune of 189 yards and three touchdowns. The win leaves Purdue in an early tie for second place in the Big Ten West along with Minnesota and Iowa.  Speaking of Iowa the Hawkeyes also got to 1-1 in conference play on Saturday by outscoring Michigan State 13-0 in the fourth quarter to spark a 26-16 victory in Iowa City. The result however comes with good news and bad news. The good news is that they got the win in large part due to defensive back Cooper DeJean who recorded six tackles and an interception to go along with his go-ahead 70-yard punt return touchdown. The bad news is the win came at the expense of starting quarterback Cade McNamara who suffered an apparent leg injury in the first quarter. Roman Wilson for Biletnikoff? Marvin Harrison Jr. is the best wide receiver in college football. But when it comes to the race for the Biletnikoff it’s Wilson that stands out among Big Ten pass catchers as the most deserving for the award. Wilson leads the FBS in receiving touchdowns with eight after adding two more Saturday in Michigan’s aforementioned blowout win over Nebraska. Oh and peep the first of those two touchdowns below. ROMAN WILSON WITH THE GROWN MAN CATCH   @UMichFootball pic.twitter.com/VFMLZEmxfL In addition to that catch of the year candidate and those eight touchdowns Wilson has 19 receptions for 326 yards this season which is 17.2 yards per catch for those of you scoring at home.

Share this story Northwestern has had quite the weekend in football. Not because it won — the Wildcats lost by four possessions — but because NU managed to hold off a team competing for a spot in the College Football Playoff. Northwestern forced Penn State’s first turnover of the season even taking the lead against the Nittany Lions for about 14 minutes of the first half (becoming the first team to do so this season).  Despite the final score this team showed some serious potential Saturday morning: here’s what we learned. Northwestern has to capitalize on potential opportunities The first play of the entire game was a turnover by Penn State to put the Wildcats on their 11-yard line giving them a miracle and a chance for a touchdown. What does Northwestern do instead? Go three-and-out with a net loss of four yards on the drive. It’s times like these that make me cringe while watching this team. However there’s some definite plausibility for future success and it showed. Northwestern kept up with Drew Allar’s offense for around 36 minutes of playing time. While there were bright spots until NU consistently plays like it did in the first half the Wildcats are going to have to execute on great field position. Brendan Sullivan isn’t quite ready to start What we saw from Sullivan this weekend wasn’t all bad; he managed to rush seven times for 25 yards and displayed great mobility whenever the pocket collapsed. More concerning however was that he ran for more yards than he passed for. Sullivan completed two-of-six passes for only eight yards and in that short amount of time the junior managed to throw an absolute dime. Unfortunately it was right into the awaiting arms of the defense. The interception was a sloppy pass completely avoidable and exemplifies why Sullivan needs more time before he can be a viable starter. He seems to either go with his first read or immediately take off with the ball. Though his mobility can be absolutely deadly he needs to work on his ability to scan the field and adjust to what is happening in real time. Until he can do that Ben Bryant has to be the quarterback the ‘Cats rely on. Ben Bryant: Let him cook Ben Bryant showed us this weekend that he has the ability to develop into a strong starting quarterback. Yes some passes were overthrown. Yes he isn’t as keen to run as Sullivan but this weekend we saw that Bryant is capable of that mobility. He may have rushed for negative yardage overall (sack-adjusted) but what I saw was a quarterback thinking in the moment and adjusting the way he needed to. My Ben Bryant conclusion? He can be mobile. He can think on the spot. He can make passes into tight coverage. If the offensive line can give him more time in the pocket I think we can see some great things at quarterback later this season. David Braun shouldn’t be “interim” This team went toe-to-toe with one of the top teams in the nation and for 30 minutes the ‘Cats were the better squad. Managing to hold the No. 6 Nittany Lions to just 10 points during the first two quarters was not an easy feat — only Iowa has managed to do the same.  The fact that David Braun scored a touchdown Saturday when Kirk Ferentz’s formerly top-25 team couldn’t even make a field goal is enough to tell me that Braun deserves to stay as head coach. His defense played some of its best football all season and clearly he’s done enough in the locker room to motivate this team. I really love the direction that this team is heading in and Braun’s coaching is a big part of it. Consistency/Inconsistency: Northwestern needs more of both Northwestern needs more variation in play calling.  For a team that finished the day with more runs than passes Northwestern only amassed 45 rushing yards with a grand total of negative-10 in the first half. The classic Northwestern gameplan of pounding the rock is not working.  One of my favorite calls? The fake punt. Although it ended up a yard short that third quarter play was exactly the kind of variation I’m looking for.  ""No. 6 @PennStateFball wasnt fooled.The Nittany Lions stuff the fake punt and take over in Northwestern territory. : @BigTenNetwork pic.twitter.com/xP41ywyuL2"" Northwestern lacks consistency in the places there should be. I see it in the offense where the team will look amazing during one drive and immensely lacking on the next but I think the special teams are overlooked.  I’ve loved the way that A.J. Henning has been able to break through and make plays on the receiving end but I’d love to see more consistency from Hunter Renner on the punting side of things. More consistency from Renner would’ve made a difference in the level of advantage Penn State was able to garner with his shortest punt being just 22 yards and putting the Nittany Lions on the Northwestern 40-yard line. Penn State eventually sealed the deal with a touchdown. Though punting may seem minute when there is an offense and defense to worry about what seems like a little thing could make all the difference. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Is there anything the No. 2 ranked Wildcats can’t do? The most recent outings for the team provided a pair of wins from Michigan teams at Lakeside Field. Against the visitors from the Great Lakes Northwestern dominated to extend its win streak to 11 games marking the longest streak for the program since 1990. Here are three takeaways from those games in which a Wildcat team that looked like a title contender smothered its midwestern visitors: The defense has been downright debilitating Annabel Skubisz has an argument for being named the best goalkeeper in the country. The senior has a goals-against average of .58 which is the third-best mark in the country. Her save percentage is 80.6% bettered by just five players in the entire nation. However Skubisz is a distant 72nd in saves per game at just 2.50. So what’s the explanation for the disparity in these numbers? It’s simple: opposing offenses just haven’t had the chance to put up good shots. Against Michigan State Skubisz faced just six shots. Against Michigan that number dipped to four. Skubisz was effectively a fan with the best seat in the house — a seat that’s enabled her to witness Northwestern’s 11-0 scoring margin over the last three games. The one shot she did save over the weekend (a third-quarter attack by Michigan State) she saved with ease.  Of course if Skubisz isn’t having to hold opponents off the scoreboard someone else must be. In fact it’s multiple someones. Players like Maja Zivojnovic Ilse Tromp Katie Jones and Lauren Hunter have made it nearly impossible for Wildcat opponents to get a clean shot on goal. Sadly there is no real stat for defensive play on nusports.com so it’s a little difficult to truly tell the story of how good the defense has been. Perhaps this will do.  Michigan State and Michigan combined to put up 10 shots on Northwestern over the weekend. One of those was close enough to a scoring threat to be defined as “on goal”. The defense has been talented enough that offenses haven’t been able to even look at the goal for more than a few seconds and even if they were able to one of the best goalies in the nation is waiting for them. The offense has been abundant Tip the cap to Michigan State’s Cecily Charles. Charles currently holds the Big Ten lead for saves in a game with 19 on Sept. 29th after picking up 14 on the 17th against Ohio State (no other Big Ten goalkeeper has more than nine saves in a game this year). And yet Northwestern won that game 6-0 the team’s largest margin of victory this year. That’s because the Wildcats unleashed an unholy 36 shots on Charles the most shots any Big Ten team has taken in a single game this year. That was the team’s highest output since Oct. 10 2021 when they sent Ball State back to Indiana with a 6-1 loss after unleashing 47 shots on the Redbirds. But surely you’re thinking the offense ran out of gas a little bit in that game. The 1-0 scoreline against Michigan would suggest that.  You’d be wrong. Northwestern put up 25 shots on the Wolverines tied for the ninth-highest output of any Big Ten team this season. Once again a great goalkeeping effort (this time from Michigan’s Caylie McMahon who had eight saves) prevented the scoreline from looking even worse. The Wildcats finally broke through on their 25th and final shot of the game with just over five minutes to play.  Looking at the stats it’s almost difficult to fathom how prolific Northwestern’s offense has been. The team has put up 255 shots an average of 21.25 per game. In four of their five last contests the Wildcats have put up 25 or more shots meaning that they have put up four of the 12 most aggressive offensive showings in the entirety of the Big Ten...all since September 17! One of the keys to this success is someone recapturing her form from 2022. Lauren Wadas is all the way back  The senior midfielder made the NFHCA’s All-West First Team last season after scoring six goals (third-best on the team) and chipping in three assists. However Wadas dealt with a slow start to her season going pointless in the team’s first six matches. Even after recovering slightly she was still sitting at just three assists on the year and had yet to score. That was of course until she erupted en route to a weekend that led to her receiving honors for Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week the second time she has received the honor.  What did Wadas do to receive the honor? Well against Michigan State she tied for the team lead in shots with six but was still unable to break her goalless streak. She did however help break a goalless streak held by someone else. First-year Ilse Tromp hadn’t managed to put forth a goal since September 8. That streak was snapped after Wadas found her on a penalty corner in the waning minutes of the Michigan State game. And one more for good measure  Q4 | Northwestern 6 Michigan State 0 pic.twitter.com/EW0iTXibTL Against Michigan though no one was scoring. As mentioned earlier the Wildcats were putting forth an offensive output that no Big Ten team has really come close to this season but it wasn’t showing on the scoreboard. The Wildcats who outshot Michigan 25-4 over the course of the game were desperately searching for a breakthrough to stay unbeaten in conference play and earn their fifth-ranked win. It was time for the senior to step up.  ""CALL STOOD. LAUREN WADAS. CATS IN FRONT.Q4 | Northwestern 1 Michigan 0 pic.twitter.com/bLjUdR1fpl"" She did. After Zivojnovic was blocked Wadas found the rebound and fired the ball home for the lead a goal that proved to be the decisive margin. The finish was the eighth game-winning goal of Wadas’ legendary career and pushed the winning streak to 11 games.  Also a special shoutout to Olivia Bent-Cole who scored her sixth goal of the season (third on the team) and is currently locked in a riveting three-woman race for Big Ten Freshman of the Year. The senior and the freshman will face their biggest test of the year along with the rest of the Wildcats when Northwestern travels to Iowa City to take on the top-ranked Hawkeyes this Friday.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Things unraveled from there but if a moral victory ever existed it’s this one. Nobody expected Northwestern to be able to contain the Tigers’ rushing attack. Nobody expected the ‘Cats’ frisky special teams play to give them an advantage. There were positives to carry forward and the even better news is theoretically this week’s matchup is very winnable. Northwestern will be at home for the third straight week to take on the Howard Bison on Saturday. Howard is 2-2 so far on the young season and is a team Northwestern should beat. After losing to Southern Illinois last year though nothing is ever a gimme. Here are three matchups to watch as the Wildcats look to climb back to a .500 record: Quinton Williams vs NU’s secondary Quinton Williams Howard’s senior signal caller is having a career year so far in his fifth season at the university. In four games he’s amassed 842 passing yards thrown eight touchdown passes and only thrown one pick. He’s not a particularly notable threat as a runner (though he’s not afraid to pull the ball down and take it himself if he has to) so the natural matchup to watch here is with the ‘Cats’ secondary. Garnet Hollis Jr. had another good game against Penn State and I feel comfortable saying he’s made real strides since last season. The rest of the secondary has continued to be a solid unit under David Braun surrendering the sixth least air yards per game in the Big Ten. One would think the Wildcat unit has an opportunity to dominate this matchup but Williams definitely presents a problem. If he shrinks under the pressure of a Big Ten game Northwestern should be able to severely limit Howard in the passing game. But if Williams plays like he has all season he’s a player to watch out for in this one. Howard run game vs Northwestern defensive line The Bison support their talented QB with a rushing attack that doesn’t feature any game-breakers but is incredibly deep. Four different players have over 100 yards for Howard the leader being Ian Wheeler with 262. Jarett Hunter however paces the roster in carries with 45. Northwestern has had a difficult time stopping the run all season giving up 174.4 rush yards per contest. That’s good for second worst in the Big Ten behind Illinois. But the defensive line was better against Penn State. The Wildcats gave up just 134 total yards on the ground against a vaunted running back duo in Nicholas Singleton and Kaytron Allen. Should Williams struggle and even if he’s effective Howard is likely to lean on its running game in an attempt to take advantage of what is viewed as a weak aspect of Northwestern’s game. The defensive line needs to prove that its improvement against Penn State wasn’t a fluke with a weaker opponent. David Braun vs Larry Scott The head coach battle will also be a factor on Saturday. This is sort of a strange game to prepare for. From the ‘Cats’ perspective conference play is very much in full swing and playing an unfamiliar non-conference foe is a weird detour. For Howard this game (theoretically) is a sudden step up in competition. Braun seems to have full control over this locker room and players seem to want to play for him. He has to make sure his players don’t get complacent or show immaturity as they prepare for a team they think they can beat. It happened last year against Southern Illinois. It could happen again. Northwestern absolutely can not allow this type of loss in back-to-back seasons. From Scott’s side of things he has the advantage of the underdog mentality. But there are enough negative opinions and press out there about this Wildcat roster. Howard can’t make the mistake of forgetting it’s still facing a power-five opponent. How both coaches manage this matchup throughout the week will play a role in the on-field product on Saturday. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story It’s officially the month of October and that means a couple of things. The temperature will start to dip slightly the leaves may start to turn and of course Big Ten conference play will kick into high gear. Two weeks ago there were five inter-conference games. Last week there were five more. And there will be at least five Big Ten-Big Ten battles every week until the end of November. We’ve made it college football fans. To celebrate here is the latest edition of Big Ten football power rankings. 1. No. 2 Michigan Wolverines (5-0 2-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 1 Last Result: W 45-7 at Nebraska Next: at Minnesota ""After a (to put it lightly) very light schedule for the Wolverines to start the year they finally went on the road. A Big Ten opponent with legitimate bowl aspirations and a raucous home crowd awaited the twice-reigning conference champions. And it went badly — for the home team. Michigan simply took Nebraska out behind the woodshed and pummeled them for 45 minutes before letting off the gas in the fourth quarter. The drive chart for the first half reads as such: Michigan touchdown Nebraska interception Michigan touchdown Nebraska turnover on downs Michigan touchdown Nebraska punt Michigan punt Nebraska punt Michigan touchdown end of half. First-half yardage total: 247-116. Michigan isn’t just the best team in the conference they might be the best team in the country. Of course we wont know for sure how good they are until November when Penn State and Ohio State await."" 2. No. 4 Ohio State Buckeyes (4-0 1-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 2 Last Result: Bye week Next: vs. Maryland I’m not sure what the Buckeyes did over the bye week other than take turns glaring at effigies of Lou Holtz and Jim Harbaugh but I’m not sure it matters all that much. Holtz dropped the Buckeyes four spots in his own poll but the AP voters have determined that the Buckeyes can keep their top 4 spot after defeating a tough gritty Notre Dame team on the road. That’s the first Ohio State game in a long while where they went up against a CFP contender and had the guts and toughness to pull out a win. Kyle McCord is probably the worst quarterback Ohio State has had as a starter in the past half-decade but that may end up being a blessing in disguise. Ryan Day said after that victory which could be tenure-defining for him that the Buckeyes are a tough team. How tough? We’ll find out a little bit more this weekend when Maryland comes to town and Penn State looms three weeks from now. 3. No. 6 Penn State Nittany Lions (5-0 2-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 3 Last Result: W 41-13 at Northwestern Next: vs. UMass (on October 14) Speaking of the Nittany Lions they had an interesting game against Northwestern on Saturday. A 10-10 half-time score turned into a dominant second half and a late backdoor cover after backup QB Beau Primula threw a 30-yard touchdown pass on a fake quarterback run. Against the Wildcats the Nittany Lions looked...average? A team that averages 1.4 yards a carry should probably not have a conference title contender on the ropes before coming up just short on a pair of fourth-and-shorts from inside their own territory. The 28-point scoreline hides the fact that Penn State had its struggles — six penalties for 45 yards 8-of-17 on third down and an inexcusable fumble on the opening kick. Against Northwestern mistakes like that don’t matter all that much. Against Ohio State they will.  4. Maryland Terrapins (5-0 2-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 4 Last Result: W 44-17 vs. Indiana Next: at No. 4 Ohio State RANK THE TERRAPINS YOU COWARDS! I’m speaking directly to voters for the AP Poll here. There is no feasible explanation for a 5-0 Maryland team that has outscored its last three opponents (all Power 5 teams) by a combined total of 77 points to be ranked below an LSU team that probably couldn’t stop me from scoring on a post route. The Terps are legit. Did you know that Taulia Tagovailoa has thrown for 1464 yards this year already the best mark in the conference and ahead of Heisman contenders like Bo Nix Cameron Ward and Quinn Ewers? The offense is also picking up 5.1 yards a pop on the ground behind only Wisconsin and Nebraska in the Big Ten. Also they’re quietly 38th in total defense this year and have forced 12 turnovers tied for third-best in the country. According to ESPN the line for their contest against Ohio State sits at -19.5 in favor of the Buckeyes. I am not a betting man but it would not shock me at all to see the Terrapins hang close and maybe even pull a season-shifting upset. 5. Iowa Hawkeyes (4-1 1-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 5 Last Result: W 26-16 vs. Michigan State Next: vs. Purdue This Hawkeye team is designed to upset me. They are currently second-to-last in total offense in the ENTIRE COUNTRY at just over 245 yards per game. Their passing yardage mark of 127 per game is ahead of five teams: Eastern Michigan Nebraska ULM and two service academies. Even their rushing attack is bottom 30 in the country. AND YET! After surviving Michigan State (and a season-ending injury to quarterback Cade McNamara) the Hawkeyes and backup quarterback Deacon Hill control their own destiny in the Big Ten West. Ferentz-style mud ball has never been stronger: the only defensive category the Hawkeyes are top 10 in is net punting! This team is an affront to good football and quite possibly to whatever deity you may worship and they are still probably going to win the Big Ten West. The best team left on their schedule is Wisconsin and if they squeak by the Badgers in some 10-6 horror film the Hawkeyes are in the driver’s seat to once again get plastered by the Big Ten East champion in January. Why can’t they switch divisions with Maryland? 6. Wisconsin Badgers (3-1 1-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 6 Last Result: Bye week Next: vs. Rutgers Hey...Badgers? How’s that newfangled more wide-open offense going? What’s that? You’ve totaled two passing touchdowns on the year a mark even Iowa has doubled? Tanner Mordecai’s passing efficiency is 95th in the country? You scored just 22 points against Washington State a team that gave up 24 to noted offensive powerhouse Colorado State? Oh well at least your next game is against Rutgers their defense is probably going to be easy to break. (Checks large flashing sign that reads: Rutgers — 10th nationally in total defense) Uh...good luck! 7. Rutgers Scarlet Knights (4-1 1-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 7 Last Result: W 52-3 vs Wagner Next: at Wisconsin Speaking of the Scarlet Knights the most surprising Big Ten team so far this year has given up more than 17 points just once to Michigan back on September 23. The vibes are really good in Piscataway right now thanks to their stifling defense and an aggressive offensive system that’s helped them go 8-for-11 on fourth down this year. And oh yeah Kyle Monangai is outrushing both Blake Corum and Braelon Allen this year by a fairly wide margin. With 5.4 yards per carry (10th most among all running backs with at least 80 carries Monangai has been delivering consistently great performances. If he can pull off another one in Madison this weekend then the Scarlet Knights will certainly be moving up this list.  8. Nebraska Cornhuskers (2-3 0-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 9 Last Result: L 45-7 vs. No. 2 Michigan Next: at Illinois I know I know. How can a team get absolutely blasted by 38 at home...and move up in the power rankings? It’s simple: the team ahead of them absolutely crapped the bed (we’ll get to them in a second). Nebraska resident Heinrich Haarberg now leads the team in passing and rushing after only three starts and most importantly he’s turned the ball over just once. In Haarberg Matt Rhule seems to have his guy for the foreseeable future which is already a major success for the program. The Cornhuskers’ next four games are against teams that sit lower than them on these rankings. If they’re able to go 3-1 all that’s needed is one upset somewhere else for Rhule and company to go bowling in his maiden voyage at the school. 9. Minnesota Golden Gophers (3-2 1-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 10 Last Result: W 35-24 vs. Louisiana-Lafayette Next: vs. No. 2 Michigan Well the losing streak is over at least. After a loss to North Carolina (no shame there) and a blown 21-point second-half lead at the hands of Northwestern (definitely some shame there) the Golden Gophers are back in the win column after a somewhat close game. The result makes more sense when considering that freshman back Darius Taylor (who still leads the conference in rushing) missed the contest with injury but giving up 349 yards to a Sun Belt team is still slightly concerning especially when your quarterback has thrown for over 200 yards just once in his collegiate career. And considering the Golden Gophers have to welcome Michigan a top-five team in total defense to town this week PJ Fleck better hope whatever was used to heal Taylor’s leg also gave him superpowers because Minnesota isn’t getting win number four otherwise. 10. Northwestern Wildcats (2-3 1-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 11 Last Result: L 41-13 vs. No. 6 Penn State Next: vs. Howard Another team moving up one spot after a home loss to a top-10 team? Absolutely! The Wildcats made Penn State look really average for over a half and if not for a few more inches on a few plays in the third quarter they may have been able to keep that up in the second half as well. At this point the worry is Ben Bryant. He’s been on fire in recent weeks leading the Minnesota comeback and then playing on roughly the same level as Penn State’s Drew Allar but his shoulder injury in the second half is tough to deal with for the Wildcats. Brendan Sullivan proved his rushing ability but also threw an ugly interception but seems to be the de facto starter if Bryant is not recovered by Saturday. Assuming the Wildcats beat Howard they’ve got about four more games they could probably win if things break right for them. A bowl bid in David Braun’s first season as a head coach is very much in play. 11. Purdue Boilermakers (2-3 1-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 13 Last Result: W 44-19 vs Illinois Next: at Iowa Where in the world was this in September? After some ridiculously poor defensive performances over the previous two weeks (over 375 yards given up against both Syracuse and Purdue) the Boilermakers’ defense woke up stifling the Illini and holding them to just 2-of-14 on third downs. It was also the best game of Hudson Card’s Purdue career as he threw for two touchdowns with no interceptions. Running back Tyrone Tracy Jr. also had a career day with 112 rushing yards the first 100-yard rushing game the jack-of-all-trades player achieved since high school. Now what team would be bad enough to give up that kind of performance to a below-average team? 12. Ill-inois Fighting Ill-ini (2-3 0-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 8 Last Result: L 44-19 at Purdue Next: vs. Nebraska ""Good gracious. This is the first performance the “Fighting” Illini have had this year that’s been absolutely inexcusable. An 11-point loss to Kansas and a 17-point loss to Penn State? Sure those are reasonable. The FAU game was a little closer than it should have been but surely Illinois figured something out. Well whatever they figured out they need to un-figure it out. Giving up 44 points to a Purdue team that hadnt scored over 24 since the 2nd of September is a borderline criminal offense and it happened in a rivalry game! This was also the first time all season that Purdue held an opponent under 24 points. Everything went wrong for Illinois but at least they have a chance to bounce back. Maryland Wisconsin and Iowa are the only teams on their remaining schedule with records of .500 or better. Can the Illini handle the other teams on that schedule? That remains to be seen."" 13. Michigan State Spartans (2-3 0-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 13 Last Result: L 26-16 at Iowa Next: at Rutgers (on October 14) All things considered Michigan State did pretty well for themselves on Saturday. In the aftermath of the Mel Tucker firing on Wednesday the Spartans looked like they belonged on the same field as the Hawkeyes who needed a fourth-quarter rally to escape with a victory. The Spartans outgained Iowa by over 100 yards and held the Hawkeyes to just 2-for-13 on third downs. However losing the turnover battle 4-2 and giving up a punt return touchdown in the fourth quarter proved fatal to any hopes of an early-season Big Ten victory. The Spartans are a scrappy team with a lot of fight but it’ll get worse before it gets better. Rutgers and Michigan are next up on the docket after a much-needed bye week. 14. Indiana Hoosiers (2-3 0-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 14 Last Result: L 44-17 vs Maryland  Next: at No. 2 Michigan  It’s been a less than ideal season for the Hoosiers who fired offensive coordinator Walt Bell over the weekend after a 17-point showing at home against Maryland. The Hoosiers are bottom 30 in the nation in total offense (334.2 yards per game) and scoring offense (20.8 points per game). The defense certainly isn’t awful — in fact at 65th it’s basically exactly average nationally in terms of yardage allowed — but the offense simply can’t score against power conference teams. And who’s up next on the schedule? Why it’s a road trip to Michigan and a home contest with Rutgers. Both of those teams are top 10 in total defense and give up an average of 21 points per game — combined. If it’s possible for a team to score points in the negatives over a two-week span we might see the Hoosiers pull it off.          \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Before the ‘Cats have a bye next week NU interim head coach David Braun met with the media Monday Afternoon to discuss  NU’s defeat to the Nittany Lions and this weekend’s game against the Bisons. Opening Statement: “I’m excited to be back with the guys today. Had an opportunity this morning to review Saturday to review Penn State. Certainly some opportunities for us to continue to have conversations about what this team is capable of. The challenge moving forward is what this team can truly be capable of when it finds a way to play a full four quarters. When we do that as a coaching staff as a program we can talk about: two-quarters fast start there’s plenty of positives to pull from but at the end of the day our guys prepared in a way that they expected victory.  They expected to go in compete and find a way to beat Penn State. Even though those on the outside certainly didn’t expect that the group in that locker room did and was certainly very very disappointed with the result.  Specifically though the way that we close out the game in the second half and in the fourth quarter we need to continue to challenge ourselves. There’s going to be people that pat you on the back and say Hey that was a great first half. Well we prepared to win a football game prepared to play a full four quarters or however long it takes. I think that gives us an opportunity as a team to continue to take full ownership in our performance and continue to take full ownership of the things that we need to continue to improve upon moving forward. Turning the page our guys will return this afternoon. We’ll start to install our game plan for Howard. Great opportunity for us to be playing back at Ryan Field on homecoming against a very good football team. A team that scored a lot of points right now. Offensively battled their tails off against a good Eastern Michigan team and we’re gonna have to be at our best. We’re gonna have to be at our best this afternoon. We’re gonna have to have a great week of preparation; the standard has been set in terms of what that’s supposed to look like — the urgency and the detail that needs to go into that.  I’ve challenged myself I’ve challenged this group moving into this afternoon and moving into the week: Tuesday Wednesday Thursday into Friday and Saturday morning that we make sure that we embody that and put our best foot forward and ensure that the best version of this team shows up on Saturday.” On Ben Bryant’s injury and possible starting quarterback: “Not specifically. What I can tell you about Ben is that dude is tough he’s gritty he’s a warrior. He’s gonna do everything in his power to get back to back to full health and be ready to play. Not sure what that looks like in terms of timeline by Saturday.  If Ben weren’t able to go as of right now would anticipate Brendan [Sullivan] going. Brendan’s earned that opportunity. He’s played well in his opportunities to come in and spell Ben. But as of right now we’re moving forward anticipating that Ben will be ready to go.” On if there was consideration sitting Ben against Howard: “That’s a great question. But to answer very directly absolutely not. This is a darn good football team coming in here. Maybe it’s my background coming from Division Two and FCS but you can put whatever letters or numbers next to a team’s name there’s darn good football at all levels. We look at this opponent the same that we would look at any opponent — an opponent that’s plenty capable of giving us a run for our money and beating us if we don’t show up at our best. So we’ll put our best foot forward.” On keeping the team focused: “Just continue to remind everyone how critical every single game and every single opportunity is. Challenge a group coming off Minnesota an emotional high is really hard to come off of sometimes. I thought our guys handled that for the most part really really well. Well now we’re coming off an emotional low. Good first half we’re in a game we’re in a battle and then the way things played out in the second half our guys were frustrated and not satisfied with the result.  If anything we should have a group that is more hungry than ever to go play our best football. And again you will not hear me once refer to our upcoming opponent as anything other than a really good opponent that we better be at our best at. I promise you in these walls there’s no mention of FCS. This is a team that we better strap it up bring our urgency bring our edge and be ready to roll.” On what he told his prior teams when going up against FBS programs: “Our message was consistently bring on the competition and it didn’t matter who we were playing. That was a message to our team about bringing our best. You bring our best on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and then make sure that that carries into Saturday. It didn’t matter if we were playing the Chicago Bears or a D-Two school that is coming into the FargoDome. Bring on the competition and show up at our best. That was the message from us coming at the FCS level.  I’m very confident that I have a firm understanding of what that level of football brings week in and week out and that’s darn good football. Those guys are on scholarship. There’s a lot of NFL football players that are that are roaming around FCS schools. I think I’ll have an opportunity to make that very clear pulling from my experience at North Dakota State. On reflecting on his time as head coach: “Opportunity to reflect: no probably not but what I will mention is that there’s a great deal of gratitude from both Kristen and I. From the support for our players for our staff the people that we’re doing this with it’s pretty neat. With our team this morning talking with our leadership and talking with our team I think where they felt tangible support day in and day out is from their parents and their teammates.  But the outpouring of support from former Northwestern football players the alumni what those men have meant to the guys in our current locker room — words can’t express it. I think this is an opportunity for us on homecoming as a team to just honor those that have worn the uniform worn the jersey and walked in our shoes.” On Brendan Sullivan’s play: “In typical Brendan fashion: it was tough it was gritty it was doing whatever he could to just keep battling with his team. The interception is a choice and a decision he’d love to have back.  But what I can tell you unequivocally without a doubt is I’ve spoken about the quality of that room as a whole from the start. I’ve spoken to the fact that Ben Bryant is our starting quarterback but the depth that exists in that room with Brendan the leadership that exists with Brendan what Ryan Hilinski brings to that room the leadership that Ryan brings to this football team what Jack Lausch has done for this offense in terms of his versatility. Regardless of how this moves forward we’re anticipating expecting Ben to be able to go but regardless how that plays out moving forward very confident Brendan’s ability to step in and help this team go win and very confident in that room as a whole. In terms of their ability to prepare to get this this team to a point where we can expect great execution and performance out of the quarterback position. On Carmine Bastone: “Carmine embodies so many of the qualities that we value here at Northwestern for many reasons. High academic engineering major and understands what this degree from Northwestern will do for him for the next 40 years not just the next four. Toughness perseverance great teammate willing to step up with courage and coach other guys and hold other guys accountable. I think it speaks to what we want to continue to build here.  We want to recruit high-end high-character young men that want to come to Northwestern. They’re willing to walk on they’re willing to put a lot of time effort and energy into maximizing their potential with hopes of earning a scholarship. Carmine has done just that. I mean that’s pretty special.  We need to continue to lean into that for this program to continue to go the places that we want it to. There’s a long history of that here at Northwestern of young men that have earned scholarships that have come here as walk-ons. Carmine is just such a great example to point to of what needs to continue to happen here.” On Jack Olsen: “Really proud of his performance. Another young man that has earned the opportunity. It hasn’t been the easiest path for him dealing with some nicks and bruises along the way since he arrived here at Northwestern. He just brings a great deal of confidence to this team to myself to Coach [Jeff] Genyk into the offense as a whole in terms of knowing that if a drive does stall out in the red zone we’re not coming up empty-handed. With his consistency we can be very confident of trotting him out there and expecting them to come back with three points.” On rotating kickoff duties: “Part of it is just kind of who’s got the hot foot. In terms of who’s kicking well. Part of it is just splitting the load with multiple kickoffs at times and handling field goal and PAT duty that can start to potentially wear on a guy. Location of where we’re putting the ball is such a critical piece of that as well.  There’s a lot of factors that go into Coach Genyk’s and my decision with that but with some of the explosive quality that Penn State possessed on special teams really felt like Luke was going to be a weapon for us with kickoffs. Really proud of the way that he stepped in and carried on that load throughout the rest of the day.” On the offensive line: “To be honest with you we’ve played around with some rotations. I feel really good about where that group is at right now in terms of the guys that we expect trotting out there as the starting group. Coach Anderson will continue to find ways to rotate guys at times to continue to build depth and find good rhythm with that group. I really believe that it comes back to what seems repetitive and cliche but comes down to balanced complementary football. Finding ways to stay balanced offensively. It’s much easier to stay balanced offensively when you’re playing in a tie game or with the lead. At the end of the day you get out in front of a Rutgers operation or a Penn State operation these talented athletic defenses and they have a 10-point lead you start to become one-dimensional as an offense.  It becomes awfully difficult to be a playcaller. It becomes awfully difficult to be an offensive lineman so we need to find balance. We need to hone into complementary football. We need to find ways to play with a lead. On getting the rushing attack going: “I think it really ties back into what I just spoke to in terms of: balanced attack complimentary football playing with the lead. A guy like Cam Porter our running back room is going to be at their best our O-Line is going to be at their best when we can find ways to be up two scores in the third quarter. Control the clock run the football and all of a sudden Coach Bajakian has the entire call sheet available to him.  That’s the brand of football that we have to strive for and continue to push for. and so much of that is not just the offense or not just the running back position not just offensive play caller it takes all three phases playing at a really high level. I truly believe in the third quarter against Penn State a couple of things go our way with the fourth down conversion or fake punt we stay in the game start to wear that opponent down a little bit you see a little bit more of that balance moving forward. The situation we got in being down by a couple of scores it went the other direction. It really comes down to just balance complimentary football and finding ways to lean on guys like Cam Porter and the rest of that running back room late in the third quarter into the fourth quarter and closing out games.” ""On lack of touches to A.J Henning and Jack Lausch: “I think you’d go back to some of the things that we’ve done in previous games when those guys had been seen at their best. I fully trust that Coach Bajakian and the offensive staff see the same things that others are recognizing. We’ll find ways to get the ball back in both of those guys hands.”"" On his message to the team this week: “We talked about the fact that we’re into the third game of our second quarter. Well-timed bye week right at halftime and the challenge is to be at our absolute best this Saturday to go 1-0 this week. If we’re able to accomplish that we go two and one in the second quarter and we go into halftime at three and three. You have a group that’s got all the goals and aspirations that we have for this group still right in front of us. It all starts with a great Monday prep and a great week of practice. The expectation is to be at our best Saturday but if you were to tell us that we were going to go into halftime coming off a win at three and three is that perfect? No. But it does give us a lot of reasons to be excited and a lot of promise ahead? Absolutely.” On having Howard come to Evanston: “I think it’s awesome. College football at its best. You talk about the student-athlete experience you talk about the student experience you talk about fans and alumni that’s incredible. To see what college football college athletics can do for the experience of a young person everything that goes in around it for the overall experience I think it’s awesome. The bands the pageantry everything that goes on pregame at halftime postgame it’s all part of it. It’s a historic opportunity for Northwestern to be playing against an HBCU.  The level of play that we’ve seen in recent years at both the FCS level and at other HBCUs is something to take note of. You go back on the history of college football there’s a lot of strong tradition a lot of strong history. That’s not just the young men or the student-athletes on the field that involves a lot of things that go on around the game day experience. So to have Howard’s band be a part of the game day experience that’s something that we won’t be able to take in as a team but something that I’m excited for our overall community to be able to experience.” On NFL talent making great plays vs. changing scheme: “I think you find balance. You find balance in the fact that you tip your hat to a very talented well-coached team but you have to be solutions-based. They made a nice play but what do we learn from that? How do we move forward to make sure that certain situation doesn’t happen again? Great coaching is identifying what our guys can do really well at a really high level consistently and leaning into those things. A team like Penn State has the ability to expose some of those things. In all three phases those are things that we need to continue to evaluate and then there’s a great deal of excitement for us as a staff moving forward long-term about recruiting young men that fit the values and the profile here at Northwestern. We can bust our tails year-round to help them develop into great NFL prospects and NFL talent and that’s been proven to be done here for a long long time. There’s there’s NFL guys on our roster too.  As we go through the recruiting process we may not be able to recruit a bunch of five-stars right now but we can recruit a bunch of young men that 36 months from now can turn themselves into guys that NFL scouts are coming through and saying ‘you know what this. guy has the potential of being a first or second-round draft pick.’ A lot of credit to Penn State but we also have to learn from those and put our guys in advantageous situations week in and week out.” On slowing Howard’s offense: “They find ways to use tempo to their advantage. They’re balanced do a nice job up front the scheme definitely fits the personnel. A couple of talented [running] backs a quarterback that spins it really well a deep wide receiver room. You turn on that Eastern Michigan film and there are some explosive plays showing up in the passing game.  They do find balance they utilize RPOs as well to put themselves in advantageous situations in the run game. It’s a team that screams an understanding of their personnel being well coached. When they start to put the pedal down and get you on your heels they can get you reeling. It’s gonna start with us doing a good job of handling the tempo being really good on first and second down and being efficient getting off the field on third down.” On Theran Johnson’s availability: “We do anticipate that Theran will be back.” On Penn State’s final touchdown: “I know the way it could have been viewed. It was truly a very well-constructed play-action pass good scheme great execution by them. I’ll never take exception to that. At the end of the day we’re out there to compete. We’re out there to play a full four quarters and the guys that Penn State trotted out there we’re going out there looking to execute a play and be at their best. At the end of the day we have to defend it so we’ll never take exception or anything like that.”  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Let’s be honest: Northwestern men’s swimming and diving did not have a good 2022-23 season. The Wildcats scored zero points at the 2023 NCAA Championships and had been on track to finish in last place at Big Tens until the final four events of the meet pushed them ahead of Penn State for seventh place. At Big Tens they also placed last in four out of five relay competitions. After the season ended Ben Miller the Northwestern swimmer closest to scoring at NCAAs opted not to take a fifth year. However the biggest news coming out of the team was the departure of arguably the most internationally well-known athlete on campus: reigning Olympic bronze medalist Federico Burdisso who abruptly entered the transfer portal and left the program midway through his senior season. In addition Katie Robinson the team’s head coach for the last three seasons left Evanston to take a job as Stanford’s associate head coach. In her place will be Rachel-Stratton Mills who used to be an associate head coach for a Bob Bowman-led (former head coach of Michael Phelps) Arizona State team. Despite their misfortunes the Wildcats can still be considered a rising team. Even after almost finishing last in the Big Ten the team’s class of 2027 is arguably the best domestic swim recruiting class in the conference.  2022-23 Season Reflection While Jasmine Nocentini stole the show on the women’s side the men’s side of NU S&D was relatively quiet. The first few meets played out in expected fashion—a win against mid-major UIC a bad loss against a ranked Michigan squad and a third-place finish behind Purdue and Louisville at the Purdue Invitational Nobody posted any eye-popping times but there was nothing to be concerned with either. Well until the Burdisso news dropped. Burdisso the first active Northwestern student to win an Olympic medal in over 50 years appeared in the transfer portal around December 2022 according to SwimSwam.com. He told SwimSwam that he “couldn’t remain in a program that was falling apart and had no leadership.”  “I would like to keep my options open. I am no longer part of Northwestern and will not be racing for them at Big Tens NCAAs or any other meet for that matter” Burdisso said. “I just want to shine some light on the issue and hopefully the athletic department will make the changes the team needs.” Meanwhile a representative from the Northwestern athletic department issued this statement regarding Burdisso: “Federico Burdisso is no longer a competitive member of the Wildcats swimming and diving team but maintains the full support of the department in the final stretch of his pursuit of a Northwestern degree. Our staff remains focused on our student-athletes who continue to invest each day in the foundation of a culture built on respect inclusion and excellence.” At the time Burdisso said he was unsure of whether he’d compete in college again (he has one more year of eligibility). As of September 2023 he is not listed on any NCAA roster. Two months later the Wildcats competed at Big Tens where they scored 618 points—41 points ahead of last-place finishers Penn State. Leading the team in individual points were Tyler Lu (42 points) Ben Miller (39) Marcus Mok (37) and Tonahauc Zinn (34). Miller and Kevin Houseman recorded the Wildcats’ highest finishes of the meet with Miller placing fourth in the 200-yard butterfly (1:41.43) and Houseman getting the same result in the 100 breaststroke (51.90). The ‘Cats qualified two swimmers Miller and Houseman for the 2023 NCAA Championships. Houseman finished 28th in the 100 breast (52.23) while Miller finished 18th in the 200 fly (1:42.35) and 40th in the 100 fly (46.98) just missing scoring in the former event. Key Additions/Athletes To Watch Considering that two-time defending Big Ten Champions Indiana will get Tunisia’s Ahmed Hafnaoui a literal World Champion and Olympic gold medalist on its roster this season (in addition to other top international recruits and divers) it’s safe to say that they have hands-down the best recruiting class in the conference. However when it comes to domestic recruiting classes in the United States Northwestern comes on top. The additions of Cade Duncan Diego Nosack and Aaron Baltaytis to the Wildcats’ squad are big ones as all three swimmers have times that are faster than any other returning swimmer on their team. In addition all three swimmers were mentioned in SwimSwam’s class of 2023 rankings with Duncan being ranked No. 18 Nosack being named an “honorable mention” and Baltaytis being named a “best of the rest” recruit. Notably no other Big Ten team had three or more recruits mentioned on this list (Indiana was the only other school with a top 20 recruit) which only accounts for U.S.-based swimmers. Duncan who specializes in sprint freestyle holds personal best times in the 50 free (19.59) 100 free (42.85) and 200 free (1:36.36) that are faster than any other swimmer at Northwestern as well as a 100 fly time (47.15) faster than everyone but Baltaytis. In fact he’s closing in on Olympic gold medalist Matt Grevers’ (who is arguably the greatest Northwestern swimmer of all time) team record times of 19.35 and 42.33 from 2005 and 2007 respectively. Also in the 100 free Duncan is ranked third amongst all incoming freshmen in the United States.  While Duncan is closing in on team records Nosack won’t even need to see improvement to take down a team record. His best time of 3:44.56 in the 400 individual medley is faster than NCAA Champion Mike Alexanderov’s 3:45.57 team record time of 3:45.57 while his 200 fly (1:44.61) and 200 IM (1:45.56) times are faster than anyone on the Northwestern roster except for Zinn’s. Baltaytis is a versatile swimmer who can help contribute to the team in butterfly backstroke and freestyle. His best times in the 100 fly (46.81) and 100 back (46.78) make him the fastest swimmer on the team in both events but he’ll likely be swimming butterfly on relays to fill the void that Miller left after he opted not to take a fifth year. Baltaytis also has decent times in the 50 (20.26) and 100 free (43.93) with his 100 free time being faster than any other swimmer on the team except for Duncan. Another interesting freshman prospect is Stuart Seymour who would be one of the team’s top swimmers in the 100 back (47.77) 200 back (1:45.92) and 100 fly (47.62). Although he’s not as fast as fellow sprinter classmates Baltaytis and Duncan he will provide the team with much-needed backstroke and butterfly depth that it didn’t really have last year. Incoming recruits might provide prowess in backstroke freestyle butterfly and IM but what they don’t have is a breaststroker. There’s no need to worry about that as Houseman is coming back for a fifth year. Houseman a member of the 2021-22 U.S. National Team was a 2022 second-team All-American in the 100 breaststroke back. He’s also the only swimmer on Northwestern’s roster who has ever scored points at NCAAs finishing 10th in the 100 breast in 2022. In 2023 he was a second off his best and finished 18th in the same event but his personal best of 51.23 from 2022 Big Tens would have been 11th. His experience on the big stage will be vital for a team dominated by younger swimmers and it would be a big boost if he returned to NCAA scoring territory. With three-time 100-breast Big Ten and NCAA Champion Max McHugh of Minnesota graduating it’s fair to say the title race at 2024 Big Tens will be wide-open and Houseman has a shot at winning. While Indiana junior Josh Matheny who is coming off of a massive streak of momentum from making the 2023 U.S. World Championships team is the prohibitive favorite it’s worth noting that Houseman’s personal best is just 0.24 seconds slower than Matheny’s meaning that he very well has a shot at upsetting the Hoosier. This is significant as the Northwestern men have not won a Big Ten championship race since 2015. Lu last season’s leading scorer at Big Tens comes into his junior season in an interesting situation. He’s still by far the team’s best backstroker and one of a handful of returning swimmers capable of finishing among the top eight in the Big Ten with his personal best of 1:41.79 from 2022 being just over a second off the 2023 NCAA invite time of 1:40.62 (that being said his 2022-23 season-best was 1:42.83). He should also remain the team’s backstroker on medley relays with Baltaytis swimming butterfly but there’s a chance that he could be replaced by Seymour if the freshman beats his best 100 back time (47.33).  Zinn will also continue to be a big contributor on a conference level. Zinn who had a successful freshman campaign last season from setting personal best times in all his primary events remains the team’s top swimmer in the 200 fly (1:44.46) as well as the second-fastest swimmer in the 200 IM (1:45.59) and 400 IM (3:49.29).  What’s Next? “New” will be the word defining the Northwestern men’s swimming and diving team this upcoming season. Most of the team’s top swimmers are freshmen inexperienced with the NCAA season format and they will be led by a new head coaching staff. This makes the Wildcats’ 2023-24 season trajectory an unpredictable one—especially considering how erratic the development of male college-aged swimmers can be. This season it will not be the results that matter but the improvements. Just hitting personal best times this season would be a great start. It is rare for a school that finished seventh in the Big Ten to have the best domestic recruiting class in the conference (with only the two-time defending champions gaining better recruits internationally) so the Wildcats must take advantage of this opportunity. That being said if Northwestern’s freshmen develop the Wildcats could be in for a much better season than last. Sprinters like Baltaytis Duncan and Seymour will be a big boost to NU relays—if the Wildcats can put together relay times that qualify for NCAAs (which did not happen last season) swimmers will be able to gain NCAA Championships experience even without making it individually.  Houseman is one swimmer who should be expected to qualify for NCAAs individually and maybe even score but the freshmen could get there with big drops in time (which are very common in a swimmer’s freshman season).  NU is capable of a fifth-place finish—two spots better than last season. Even if none of the freshmen improve top names like Duncan Nosack Baltaytis and Seymour should all be capable of scoring at least 40-50 points (and this doesn’t even include how much they will help Northwestern relays) which should account for the 167-point gap that fifth-place Minnesota had over the Wildcats.  This season will be an experimental one for the men’s team but Northwestern is graced with lots of potential.  Both the Northwestern men and women begin their season on Oct. 13 in an away meet against Cincinnati. Mark your calendars!

Share this story Northwestern volleyball notched its first conference win of the season on Sunday coming back from down two sets to stun No. 17 Purdue on the road. Yet while the victory may have seemed shocking on paper it was the culmination of a weekend which saw signs of the ‘Cats growing in confidence and grit. Two days prior Welsh-Ryan Arena witnessed Shane Davis’ side lose in heartbreaking fashion to Michigan State after battling back from the brink in both the fourth and fifth sets. With Northwestern now 7-7 on the season and 1-3 in Big Ten play the team has plenty of time to turn its season around. If it does these past two games may well prove to be a major turning point. Michigan State squeezes by Northwestern in thriller In front of a crowd of 1378 supporters that included an initially packed student section the Wildcats fell to unranked Michigan State in five sets. The biggest story of the volleyball season thus far has been the setting of all-time program attendance records on two separate occasions. Although Friday night saw attendance reach only just over a quarter of that history-making mark the fans present at Welsh-Ryan were able to create a boisterous atmosphere even as the match stretched late into the evening. The contest was nail-bitingly competitive throughout with neither team claiming a set by more than five points. It was NU who got off to a fast start never looking back after Michigan State’s last lead at 2-1 and eventually taking the first set 25-21. In the second set the two sides were deadlocked at 16-16 before MSU junior Julia Bishop went on an ultimately decisive six-point serving run. Bishop who utilizes an unorthodox serving technique which involves standing several feet behind the baseline and keeping her feet planted on the ground caused problems for Northwestern’s returners all night.  The third set was even closer than the previous two with Northwestern earning itself a set point at 24-23. With their backs against the wall however the Spartans stayed aggressive. Junior Grace Kelly delivered a vicious cross-court kill down set point and then closed out the set with an ace. In the fourth set it was Michigan State who found themselves in an advantageous position late on seeking to close out the match as the score sat at 23-21. This time it was the ‘Cats who thrived under pressure first turning a return into an immediate kill by sophomore Averie Hernandez to earn a side out.  The Spartans appeared to set up double match point when Aliyah Moore blocked Julia Sangiacomo’s kill attempt but a video review initiated by ‘Cats coach Shane Davis revealed that the MSU sophomore transfer had touched the net thus tying the set at 23-23. Two points later Sangiacomo was not to be denied as her kill sealed the set and extended the match.  Michigan State came flying out of the blocks in the first-to-15 final set and it looked as though it had built up an unassailable 13-7 lead before the home side even had time to regroup from its fourth set heroics. In fact the ‘Cats had one more fight in them as they pulled off a remarkable string of six points many of which were long rallies. Having tied the game maintaining their run proved a task too steep — Ellee Stinson’s set sailed over the net and wide on match point and Northwestern sunk to 0-3 in conference play. Hernandez led the way with 15 kills for the ‘Cats who left Welsh-Ryan Arena empty-handed despite a performance full of heart.  Sangiacomo shines as Northwestern stuns No. 17 Purdue Two days after the MSU contest graduate transfer Julia Sangiacomo posted a career-best performance as the unranked Wildcats came back from the jaws of defeat to upset No. 17 Purdue. Sangiacomo a California native who spent the first four years of her college volleyball career at Santa Clara University finished with 33 kills. That mark not only surpassed her previous career-high of 27 but was also the most kills by a Big Ten player in any conference or non-conference game since Paige Jones recorded 37 for Michigan against Indiana in March 2021. It was also the second-highest single-match kill total in program history. While Sangiacomo’s dominance was the game’s defining feature it was another team effort from Northwestern that allowed it to methodically plug away at Purdue’s two-set lead and ultimately triumph. Unlike in the Michigan State game neither of the first two sets were particularly competitive — the Boilermakers took both 25-17 and 25-15. The ‘Cats started the third strong leading the way for the vast majority of the set until Purdue leveled the score at 22-22. Though the hosts never held a match point they were two points away on three separate occasions late in the third set and failed to convert. With the game on the line Hernandez came up clutch with back-to-back kills to clinch a 27-25 victory.  With the momentum on its side Northwestern kicked on in the fourth set while their opponents folded altogether. A five-point streak to start the set was a sign of things to come and the ‘Cats prevailed 25-11. In the early stages of the fifth it looked as though the Boilermakers had regained their footing. After finding itself facing an 11-8 deficit Northwestern called a timeout turning the set and match on its head. Sangiacomo took over from that point on recording four kills in the final eight points to complete the Cats’ improbable comeback.  The final point of the match was initially awarded to Purdue after Hernandez’ spike sailed long but upon further review the ball was adjudicated to have grazed the fingers of junior Lourdés Myers as she attempted a block. When the final decision was announced Northwestern’s entire team mobbed the court in celebration. It was a momentous victory both in the context of the match and the season as a whole and one that should give the ‘Cats enormous confidence as they move forward. Big Ten play continues for them this Friday in Ann Arbor as they take on Michigan before a Saturday rematch with Michigan State will test the extent of the team’s newfound belief. With 16 conference games remaining anything is still on the table for Northwestern volleyball.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Week Four yielded good injury news for some former ‘Cats. Greg Newsome II (elbow) returned to the Browns’ secondary against the Ravens while Peter Skoronski (appendectomy) is getting closer to returning to practice for the Titans.  There were plenty of once-Wildcats who saw action for their teams this week. With that being said let’s take a look at our NU alumni’s accomplishments on the field. Rashawn Slater: Los Angeles Chargers OT Slater and the Chargers’ offense were a little spotty in their divisional clash against Las Vegas. While they escaped with a 24-17 win the third-year tackle allowed four pressures after giving up just three all season. Slater still hasn’t missed a snap or given up a sack this season but it was an uncharacteristic performance for the typically consistent lineman. He was a limited participant in Thursday’s practice with an ankle injury so that could be the reason for his rough game.  The 2021 first-round pick will get a chance to recover during the Chargers’ upcoming bye week. Los Angeles will need Slater at full health when they host the Cowboys in what should be a shootout. Week Five matchup: Bye Greg Newsome II: Cleveland Browns CB Newsome II returned to the Browns’ lineup after missing last week with an elbow injury. His presence wasn’t enough to reinforce the defense as Cleveland was shredded by Lamar Jackson in a 28-3 loss. With Deshaun Watson out rookie quarterback Dorian-Thompson Robinson barely completed half of his passes and threw three interceptions. The Browns are still the NFL’s best defense in terms of yards allowed but they’ve picked off opposing quarterbacks just once this season. Newsome can help take Cleveland to a new level by making more impact plays. He had an encouraging statline on Sunday with a pass deflection and a tackle for loss. Newsome and the Browns will spend this week watching film and bracing for a tough opponent in the 49ers on Oct. 15. Week Five matchup: Bye Dean Lowry: Minnesota Vikings DE Lowry’s role is continuing to decrease as he saw the field for just 31% of the Vikings’ defensive snaps in a 21-13 victory against the Panthers. He managed to get on the stat sheet this week: the eight-year veteran assisted on two tackles (one of them for a negative gain) and deflected a pass.  Still Pro Football Focus shows that Lowry and Jaquelin Roy — his presumptive replacement — struggled mightily against Carolina’s offensive line: #Vikings Worst PFF GradesOffense:Jordan Addison - 45.5Kirk Cousins - 53.3Ezra Cleveland - 54.6Johnny Mundt - 56.7K.J. Osborn - 57.9Defense:Pat Jones II - 40.3Ivan Pace Jr. - 59.4Dean Lowry - 59.8Jaquelin Roy - 60.3Byron Murphy Jr. - 60.5 It’s getting more and more clear that the Vikings simply missed on Lowry who they signed to a two-year $8.5 million contract this offseason in hopes of bolstering their pass rush. Minnesota will hold out hope for Lowry to contribute against a solid Chiefs offense on Sunday. Week Five matchup: vs. Kansas City Chiefs (Sunday 3:25 p.m. CT) Anthony Walker Jr.: Cleveland Browns LB The Browns didn’t get the result they wanted against Baltimore but Walker Jr. had his best individual performance of the season. He played a season-high 41 defensive snaps and recorded nine tackles (six solo) as he patrolled the middle of the field. As one of Cleveland’s five captains Walker is a leader on the team who exemplifies sheer effort every time he suits up. He is looking more confident by the week as he continues to work back from a season-ending quad injury last year. Walker and his teammates will use their bye week as an opportunity to rest and recharge before facing the Niners. Week Five matchup: Bye Cameron Mitchell: Cleveland Browns CB Mitchell returned to his special teams duties after admirably filling in for Newsome last week. He didn’t record any stats in five defensive snaps. If last week’s result proves anything it’s that Mitchell can hold his own in the slot. For now he will continue to back up Newsome and jump in if injuries arise in the secondary.   Week Five matchup: Bye Ben Skowronek: Los Angeles Rams WR After contributing in some capacity every week Skowronek was completely blanked in the Rams’ 29-23 overtime win over the Colts. He played his normal amount of snaps on offense (27%) and special teams (67%) but was unable to make a difference for Los Angeles. Skowronek has almost completely disappeared in Sean McVay’s scheme but the Rams will need all hands on deck when they host the Eagles this weekend. Week Five matchup: vs. Philadelphia Eagles (Sunday 3:05 p.m. CT) Blake Hance: Jacksonville Jaguars OG Hance saw the field for 10 offensive snaps after playing just one over the first three weeks of the season. He featured in the Jaguars’ jumbo packages on the way to a 23-7 win against the Falcons in London. Sixteen-year veteran Calais Campbell manhandled Hance at times showing why he isn’t one of Jacksonville’s starting guards.  After going undrafted in 2019 Hance is on his seventh team. He and the Jaguars will look to notch a season-defining win against the Bills in front of the London fans in Week Five. Week Five matchup: at Buffalo Bills (Sunday 8:30 a.m. CT) ‘Cats that didn’t play this week (or record any stats): Evan Hull (Indianapolis Colts torn meniscus) Peter Skoronski (Tennessee Titans appendectomy) Earnest Brown IV (Los Angeles Rams) Adetomiwa Adebawore (Indianapolis Colts) Tyler Lancaster (Denver Broncos practice squad) Ifeadi Odenigbo (New York Jets injured reserve) Godwin Igwebuike (Pittsburgh Steelers) Joe Gaziano (Atlanta Falcons) Trevor Siemian (New York Jets) \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story I can’t remember a single time last year when I didn’t dread watching Northwestern play football on a Saturday. As the days got colder the season got more and more bleak and every weekend left my heart feeling heavy. Now? Pure unadulterated excitement. Although it feels absolutely foreign it’s exactly the sensation I’ve been looking for.  NU’s first half (and even the beginning of the third quarter) against the Nittany Lions last week was one of the best showings I’ve seen from this team all season. The offense was able to snatch 13 points from Manny Diaz’s defense something not even Iowa could do — and the Hawkeyes were ranked No. 24 in the country at the time. As for the Wildcats’ defense they’ve tended to be more of a problem area so far. Until Penn State they were having a lot of trouble stopping their opponents’ run game; at Duke Northwestern allowed a hefty 268 rushing yards with an average of 6.7 yards on the play. Last week there was vast improvement — I’ll let these pictures do the talking. pic.twitter.com/Mam251yciH Rewind the clock another week to the most unforgettable Saturday yet (for good reason finally) against the Golden Gophers. There’s video evidence somewhere of me screaming as Charlie Mangieri caught that last pass from Ben Bryant before all of a sudden I’m sprinting onto the field with the most loyal of fans. For the first time since last men’s basketball season I felt genuine hope while sitting in the student section. Northwestern can win against Howard. I believe it has the talent and capability; so long as they put everything together the ‘Cats’ victory is imminent. Now I can’t say I’ve followed the Bison as closely this year as NU’s other Big Ten opponents but I see in Northwestern a lot of promise.  Looking back at the UTEP game the Wildcats went for 391 total yards five touchdowns and the defense added three interceptions. Each touchdown was scored by a different person — some names on that list include Jack Lausch Thomas Gordon and Joseph Himon II. On a more melancholic note the last time NU played an FCS school was when the ‘Cats fell to the likes of Southern Illinois in September of last year. To this day I try to forget that game. Ryan Hilinski went 27-for-43 but ended the game with two interceptions and the ‘Cats fell just a touchdown short of the win. This game was the precursor to the poor performance the team demonstrated during that dreaded conference slate. Luckily the circumstances are different this time; unlike the 2022 squad this year’s guys have already proved their skill against UTEP Minnesota and even Penn State. I’d love to see some players shine versus Howard that we might not have heard as much about this year. I’m thinking of Cam Johnson who’s averaged about 51 yards a game; I think the transfer from Arizona State has a lot left to show. Defensively I think Devin Turner has really prospered so far. The sophomore has 16 solo tackles on the season and I think this Saturday offers the chance to be a breakout weekend for him. If the ‘Cats are doing well enough I’d even want to see playing time for Brendan Sullivan. I do think he has work to do but there’s so much room for him to develop into a great quarterback. If we’re looking further into the future the matchups I’m really looking at are against Nebraska Purdue and the regular season finale against rival Illinois. The Wildcats share a two-win three-loss record with each of these teams and they have a better conference record than Illinois and Nebraska who have yet to win a Big Ten matchup.  I can admit it: my preseason projections were wrong. I wildly underestimated the way this team would play in conference games. Rutgers might have been a low point sure but the ‘Cats have been climbing up the ladder from there. I thought at a certain point that one win would have been a miracle but now four or five wins seems to be a reasonable expectation.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Exactly 89 days have passed since July 7 when former Northwestern football head coach Pat Fitzgerald was given a two-week suspension following an investigation by Maggie Hickey of ArentFox Schiff. In that span of nearly three months the school fired Fitzgerald due to accusations of hazing and racism; relieved former head baseball coach Jim Foster of his duties after reports surfaced of an abusive culture and hired Ben Greenspan to lead the program; has seen lawsuits filed against it by athletes in almost every sport; and has attempted to turn the page to its 2023 fall seasons. At the helm of such institutional decisions and all Wildcat teams is athletic director Derrick Gragg who became the subject of scrutiny and denouncement — even publicly from members of NU athletic teams. With Northwestern’s homecoming this week and nearly halfway through the 2023 football season Gragg sat down exclusively with Inside NU’s Bradley Locker and David Gold to reflect on his decisions and conversations this summer searches for head coaches in several sports previous reports about his own professional interests and Northwestern’s foreseeable athletic future. This article marks the fourth interview with Gragg since the firing of Fitzgerald and first with student media. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. Inside NU: How would you assess the general student sentiment around athletics with everybody back on campus three weeks into the school year so far? Derrick Gragg: Well first of all after a very distressing and challenging summer it’s been so great to have everybody back on campus. I’ve been getting the same remarks from professors on campus that I’m in contact with — we had a board meeting a couple of weeks ago. I want to credit our student-athletes for their collective resilience because they’ve been through a lot. But I think student interest in our events is up. We appreciate that and we appreciate the students. I want to thank the students the way they rallied around the student-athletes. Record attendance at volleyball games record student attendance at women’s soccer. We had 700-plus students at a women’s soccer game last week and I think our highest attendance before that had been about 150. So we recognize that and we want to continue to recognize that. We actually did a pregame event for all the students and faculty that people partook of while they were here. So we want to continue to do things like that to bring students…  Just to comment on [the ticket system] too: I want to credit [Associate AD for Marketing and Fan Engagement] Daniel Nunes and our marketing team because they’ve been working a lot to come up with different creative ways to meet the ticket demand from the students so that’s a great problem to have. Every system is not perfect as you know. So we’ll continue to tweak the system as we go along because we want to make sure that we reward the most passionate dedicated students first. We don’t want our system crashing like it did last year. So we’re trying to avoid that. And then we want to provide much more exposure to some of our other great sport programs that some students just aren’t accustomed to attending. And that’s why we put the system in place and that’s what’s [driven] the attendance in some of our other sport programs. It’s working good so far. We know we have some complaints. We’ll continue to monitor those. We’ll continue to take feedback and we’ll continue to tweak it as we go along. INU: Was there ever any consideration to expanding the student section in Welsh-Ryan Arena including the second tier right above what’s been the traditional student section? Gragg: We talked a lot about that. We did expand the student section but at some point you still have to make sure you take care of your patrons your season ticket-holders those who we’re counting on to help with our revenue generation too. So I think we’re still going to look at expanding it a bit more for this season as well. We’re going to try to do everything we can because there’s huge demand. We don’t want to turn anybody away and that’s another thing that we’re trying to do as we continue to implement this system. INU: Have you noticed a shift in donors or alumni sentiment toward athletics since what’s happened over this summer? Gragg: We’ve had great donor support. We always have. We’ve been able to rely on the alumni the families and the donors here for many many years. I think that that’s going to continue. We just finished the Combe Family Tennis [Center] indoor facility and that was based on great donation from a lot of our alumni donors. So we haven’t seen a drop-off as it relates to that. Everybody knows how committed the Ryan Family is to the institution and to the Ryan Field project. Right now we’re hoping to continue that. We also completed our field hockey turf project; we completed Blomquist [Recreation Center] which was closed down all summer. We’re moving ahead with some of those things. We’re also excited about being able to renovate the softball facility and we have great donor interest in that right now too. That’s been introduced to the board in this past meeting and we look forward to moving ahead with that project as well. INU: Would that be an expansion of seats? What would that renovation look like? Gragg: Some expansion of seats and just the remodeling of the entire complex. That’s a great championship program and we believe in ensuring that our student-athletes be able to compete in the best facilities possible. That’s what we’re driving toward with that project. INU: Is there any rough timetable for that yet? Gragg: No not yet. But obviously we want to be able to complete it as soon as we possibly can. INU: Speaking of the Ryan family were there conversations with the Ryans about the decisions made this summer before those were made in order to make sure that donors and everyone were aligned with the decisions the University was making? Gragg: Obviously we have a lot of communication with the Ryan family. I meet or talk to someone within the family mainly Pat Jr. probably every week or 10 days. So we keep in close contact. We’re also on a committee together that oversees the stadium project so we’re in regular communication. They remain very committed to the university and the project. INU: What’s your relationship been like with members of the football team some of whom openly criticized the decisions you made on social media and were public with that criticism? Gragg: I’ve said this before: any leader in a position like this has to understand scrutiny and criticism are going to come whether it’s from inside or outside the organization. What I ask is that people at least respect the decision-making processes. A lot of discussions go on when decisions are made like this.  Regardless of the criticism I’m a former student-athlete. This is my 30th year doing this. I’ve spent my entire adult life almost every day on a campus since 1988 when I went to Vanderbilt and played football. So I understand it and I empathize with them because there was a coaching change made going into my senior year. It was far less scrutiny than this; social media didn’t exist back then obviously. This is far more public and it’s unorthodox because of the timing of it. In a regular change cycle with coaches it would happen late-November December. But this happened by and large just a couple of weeks after some of these student-athletes were just coming here to start practice. I empathize with them and that’s why we’re being sensitive to that. We’re trying to be as responsive as we can and we’ll continue to do so. With people on the outside of the organization the factions or the different opinions...the one thing we want everybody to do is to rally around the student-athletes because they deserve it. Right now they’re competing very well. We expect and look to get back to 3-3 this week. We’ll be off a week and then we go into the last six games with a fighting chance with all of our goals right ahead of us. That’s what we’re looking to do. INU: You promoted a coach who had never coached at the FBS level in David Braun. What have you seen from him from when he stepped on campus in January to becoming an interim head coach in July to now? Gragg: First and foremost he’s a competitor. I won’t get into what he says in the locker room but he’s usually spot-on with what he says postgame with what he says pregame. He has really rallied the team to stick together under very adverse circumstances. He’s also done a great job of keeping the staff together. What we’re looking at is student-athletes between 18 and 22 years old. And all of a sudden their lives have changed drastically. For him to be able to manage that there’s a lot of emotion there. You have to deal with the parents and keep the team on track to continue down this road of success that I think we’re on. It’s really been very positive. He came from a program that produced national championships; he was [FootballScoop’s] Coordinator of the Year on that level. So he’s not accustomed to losing and I think he’s responded very well. INU: Have you talked to members of the athletic department President Michael Schill or Braun himself about removing that interim tag and what would the head coaching search look like? Gragg: We’re right at the initial stages of it. I’ve talked to David Braun about it but I won’t share too much publicly about the search right now. INU: You also made the decision to hire Ben Greenspan as the baseball head coach. What did that process look like especially so late in the hiring cycle to get a standout candidate? Gragg: We talked to the current players and we talked to alumni. I wanted to talk to some of the younger alumni in particular about what their thoughts were. We decided at the end of that that it’d be best to forge ahead with a search. We got tremendous response right off the bat. We talked to some of the best head coaches and assistant coaches in America. We used DHR International as the search firm to assist us with that process. Ben Greenspan comes highly recommended. Very accomplished. He’s a Big Ten guy through and through. He was the captain of the baseball team when he was at Indiana. He was on the coaching staff that took the team to the [College] World Series. He was at Michigan and he’s been at Arizona State so great deal of experience. The student-athletes have responded to him very well. I also want to point out that we hired Rachel Stratton-Mills as our director of swimming and diving. She’s one of only a handful of women that’s ever been placed in a position like that with a combined program. She comes to us from Arizona State and was one of the top assistant coaches in America. As everyone knows great programs like this are built on the backs and shoulders of great coaches and I think those two fit in very well with the great staff that we have here now. INU: Some of the players and recent alumni seemed like they understood that assistant coach Brian Anderson was going to be the head coach moving forward. Can you walk us through why you decided not to promote Anderson to full-time coach and if you feel there was adequate communication with the players and others associated with the program? Gragg: Obviously with who we chose and looking at the entire pool including Brian Anderson we wanted to make sure that we got the most experienced person as possible so we really feel like we got that. [Greenspan] is a great fit. Again he’s a Big Ten guy. He has 15 years of experience. As it relates to what’s communicated to student-athletes or other people when you do these searches you have to keep confidentiality at the forefront so you don’t want to share a lot of things. It would be great to be able to. Years ago there used to be more searches that maybe included one or two student-athletes but because of the advent of social media and all the ways information spreads that’s been fairly limited as we moved along. I think we had a great process and search firms helped with that too. INU: You mentioned search firms. Will a search firm be used as well for the head football head coaching search? Gragg: We will have a search firm for that. Again I don’t want to talk a whole lot about the football coaching search. INU: Jim O’Donnell of the Daily Herald reported that you had been instructed not to hire a search firm. Is that correct? Gragg: That’s incorrect. We have enlisted a search firm to help us and assist us with the football search. INU: The previous baseball head coach Jim Foster was technically relieved of his duties and placed on indefinite suspension. Are you able to comment on whether or not he has technically been fired yet?  Gragg: No I’m not able to comment on anything regarding the past baseball coach. INU: 670 The Score reported that boosters were more involved in hiring Coach Foster than the athletic department had alluded to originally. Is it true that these boosters had a bigger say in hiring Jim Foster? Gragg: No that’s incorrect. Any time you hire a head coach most prudent athletic directors seek guidance and advice from alumni former players and that was the same thing that we did with Ben Greenspan. At the end of the day the athletic director makes the call on who gets hired. INU: Speaking broadly about the baseball team the turnover that’s happened and not a lot of success in the last few years. What would you say your relationship has been like with the members of that organization? Gragg: That’s a great question. Let me ask you. What do you think? What are they saying? INU: Players were definitely unhappy with the lack of communication at least in the chance that we had to speak to them. One player said that the department was “functioning right now with the sole purpose of keeping mouths shut” so a strong comment there. Gragg: I think when you’re making decisions and trying to move programs ahead — we haven’t been to but one NCAA Tournament in baseball and that was in 1957. So we wanted to make sure getting a second chance at that we got it right. We didn’t want to spread a lot of information out there that would get out there and basically make candidates afraid of being involved in the search process. I think Coach Greenspan is doing a great job of communicating. He has a lot of touches with those guys and he’s doing what he needs to do as the head baseball coach. I think they’ll rally around him. INU: The day Jim Foster was relieved of his duties the transfer portal closed at midnight for baseball players. Did that looming deadline change your decision? Maybe speed up the process more than you had originally intended to? Gragg: No that wasn’t taken into effect. Once you make changes with coaches there’s another 30-day window that opens up. INU: Another sport that had hazing scandals this offseason was volleyball. You made the decision to give head coach Shane Davis an extension in Dec. 2021. University spokesperson Jon Yates confirmed to us and the public that Davis was suspended in March of that season for a hazing incident. Were you aware of that suspension when you granted him an extension? Gragg: I’m not going to comment on anything regarding Coach Davis. The volleyball team is off to a good start. They just beat a ranked team. We want to make sure that we keep that going and help support our student-athletes. INU: What is the plan going forward for football assistants that were retained through the 2023 season? Gragg: I think everybody on staff that’s the staff who want to be here employed. The decisions regarding employment will be made after the season. INU: In a more macro sense now that three months have elapsed since the start of July would you say you regret anything you handled this summer or any decision that you made? Gragg: The situation became so litigious so quickly. I wish in looking back that we would have been able to get more information out publicly. That’s probably the one thing. But what we did was we focused a lot internally on trying to make sure that we had all the systems in place in everything we needed to move forward with our student-athletes. That’s what we focused mostly on and I’m glad we did that. But I wish maybe in the beginning we could have gotten more information out. INU: In retrospect would you have liked for the full Hickey investigation to have been released to the public? Gragg: I can’t comment on the report. I don’t want to go down that road. INU: There are other ongoing investigations in the athletic department with football associate head coach Matt MacPherson and Loretta Lynch. Are you able to share any updates or timeframes for those? Gragg: Loretta Lynch and her team from [Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison] met with our entire head coaching staff all our head coaches and our leadership team a couple of weeks ago. I think that went very well. She laid out the timetable. These are reviews — these aren’t investigations. I would stress that and so we welcome that. We’ll be looking a lot at reporting systems looking a lot at culture. I think it’s a great opportunity for our coaches and everybody else who’s involved with it to talk about the way that they’ve built success here. We have a very close-knit group of coaches. A lot of them have been here for 10 15 20 years. They’re very tight and are willing to support us as we move forward. We’re looking forward to having more dialogue with that team. INU: In the midst of athletic controversy did you ever personally worry about your job security as athletic director of Northwestern? Gragg: I think when you’re in this position I wouldn’t say worried about it. You always know that when decisions are made on this level you have to be prepared for scrutiny criticism backlash or the fallout. I’ve been involved in many situations during the course of my 30-year career but I have a compliance background. I believe in doing things the right way. The one thing that I can say is with that background I learned a long time ago to act with integrity do the right thing receive information report it to the right authorities. That’s what we’ve done in all these cases so I stand by that. INU: What were your conversations like with President Schill during the summer about your job status or your plan of action? Gragg: I wouldn’t get into any of the conversations that President Schill and I had. Those are private conversations but he’s been very supportive. INU: There’s little question that despite the scandals of the summer Pat Fitzgerald is one of the most decorated players and coaches in Northwestern Athletics history. What is the school’s plan moving forward to recognize Fitzgerald if at all? Gragg: We haven’t had a lot of discussion regarding that topic. I wouldn’t want to touch on that in this article. INU: The Daily Herald reported that you have shown interest in Washington’s vacant AD position. Is there any validity to that? Gragg: No that’s incorrect. I haven’t been contacted by whoever the search firm is who’s handling that. I’m sure a search firm is handling it. I haven’t reached out. I also think that they said that my contract was two-and-a-half years. That’s also incorrect. INU: Would you like to share how long your contract is? Gragg: No but that’s incorrect. INU: Northwestern’s deal with Under Armour has been in place for 12 seasons. What’s the status of the school’s partnership with the brand? Are you able to disclose any conversations you’ve had with Under Armour or any other outfitters? Gragg: Obviously we’ve had a great partnership with Under Armour. We appreciate the partnership that we’ve had. It’s a long-term partnership that will be reviewed in the upcoming year on both sides. We’ve been very pleased with having them as a partner. INU: This summer the Big Ten will expand from 14 to 18 schools. Are you concerned at all regarding travel for non-football athletes who may have to venture across the country multiple times per week? Gragg: That’s been a big topic of conversation as you can imagine. One of the main things is to transition into the new Big Ten. Right now we’re working a lot on scheduling models. We have a joint group meeting the week after next starting with next Sunday where all those things will be discussed. Obviously we want to make sure that we always ensure that our student-athletes are safe and that their well-being is first and foremost. Working on models to make sure that we support them and keep maintaining our academic excellence in particular because everybody knows that that’s one of our foundations here. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1

Share this story Although Northwestern basketball is striving to maintain its mojo and rhythm from an enchanting 2022-23 season its jerseys won’t exactly carry over. On Thursday evening the school announced modifications to its base jerseys (white home and purple away) for both the men’s and women’s program. Notably the Under Armour logo has shifted from the left chest to atop the jersey; the “Northwestern” script is now slightly arched instead of linear; striping extends from the base to the sleeves; and the same style of piping now wraps around the shorts. pic.twitter.com/R2uoPkWZbL ""New    threads just dropped   pic.twitter.com/9eK5CiptpZ"" “We want to make sure our Northwestern brand is still the brand” assistant equipment manager Jeren McGhee said about the slight updates. “We would hate for our jerseys to represent somebody else or get mistaken for another team. We just try to make it a tweak; little changes here and there.” The men’s team will retain its gray and gothic jerseys which also feature minimal changes; more specifically the logo and piping is different on the gray while the gothic will have additional striping. Moreover McGhee confirmed to Inside NU that the men’s squad will continue donning its all-white “Chicago’s Own” jerseys that debuted last year and quickly became fan favorites. McGhee said fans can expect to see them “a couple of times” throughout 2023-24. The last alterations made to Northwestern’s jerseys came in 2019 when striping was removed from the base of the jersey. Those uniforms had been in effect through last season. The team circulates new uniforms every four years with Under Armour as part of its partnership. As for team reaction early reads appear very positive. “The guys love them” McGhee said. “We always say ‘You look good you play good.’ The new jerseys that we have we hope the guys can play well [in] and get us back to the NCAA Tournament.” The men’s ‘Cats will debut their new garb when they take on McKendree on Nov. 1 in an exhibition followed by a home clash with Binghamton on Nov. 6. As for the women’s team the debut of such nascent garb comes Nov. 2 against Lewis and Nov. 9 vs. UIC in actual gameplay. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story It’s Week Two of the Wildcats’ 2006 season. After blowing out Miami (Ohio) NU is slated to play its first FCS opponent in program history — the New Hampshire Wildcats. This will be Northwestern’s first home game since losing head coach Randy Walker to a heart attack in June so the team has a bigger reason driving it this Saturday.  Very little goes right for the ‘Cats. New Hampshire takes less than five minutes to establish an early 13-0 lead. NU fires back with two touchdowns of its own but it’s not enough to keep pace with New Hampshire’s blistering no-huddle offense. The Wildcats of the Northeast steal the win at Ryan Field 34-17. This begins Northwestern’s complicated relationship with its FCS adversaries. This article is not about reliving some of the embarrassing losses the ‘Cats have suffered over the years. Instead I’ll sort through the logos of all 11 FCS teams that NU has faced taking into consideration both aesthetics and the history behind the mascot. With that being said let’s get to ranking! 11. Northeastern Huskies Before Northeastern ended its football program in 2009 the Huskies sported some of the most boring uniforms I’ve ever seen — and their logo was no different. They donned a red-and-black “N” on their helmets neglecting to get creative with their canine mascot. There was so much potential but the bland serif typeface couldn’t help a team that dissolved just two years after the ‘Cats blew them out in a 27-0 victory. 10. Indiana State Sycamores When most people think of the Sycamores they envision a young Larry Bird lighting up the Missouri Valley Conference. A powder blue jersey with pinstripe shorts just oozes late-1970s charm. But Indiana State’s modern football team has no such character. The team’s logo consists of “Sycamores” laid over a silhouette of the state leaving much to be desired. I need to see more imagery that pays homage to the beautiful tree. NU hewed the Sycamores in a sound 24-6 decision in 2021. 9. New Hampshire Wildcats New Hampshire’s rendition of the best mascot in college football (shoutout to Willie) definitely gets points in the ferocity department. Nonetheless the muted blue-and-gray color scheme is reminiscent of a high school team. According to UNH’s website a wildcat is  “small and aggressive — like New Hampshire.” No one does a Wildcat like Northwestern except when northeastern rivals bested the purple-and-white in 2006’s 34-17 clash. 8. Eastern Illinois Panthers No one can deny that the Panthers’ logo looks menacing but another blue-and-white palette is nothing to write home about. The side profile is very similar to Penn State’s Nittany Lion shield so I have to penalize them for a lack of originality. The panther is a pretty derivative mascot but just seven schools were using it when Eastern Illinois adopted it in 1930. Nowadays 29 institutions across the country sport the big cat in their athletic branding. NU bested the Panthers in 2011 and again in 2015 for a combined score of 83-21. 7. Illinois State Redbirds This bird is angry — it looks ready to charge like Brian Dawkins in his prime. You rarely find this kind of emotion in a logo especially in the NFL. This is how to make a small bird look intimidating (ahem Arizona Cardinals). The Redbirds had their wings clipped in a 37-3 loss to the ‘Cats in 2010 but got their revenge in a 9-7 victory in 2016. 6. South Dakota Coyotes It’s pronounced KY-ohts the University of South Dakota will have you know. On each helmet the school’s initials are nestled in a red coyote paw with its claws out. The vermillion and white logo is certainly fitting as the coyote is South Dakota’s state animal. I think the school could use more than the paw to show its state pride but it’s a solid emblem that reminds me of the San Francisco 49ers’ throwback uniforms. The Wildcats bit the Coyotes in a 38-7 rout in 2012. 5. Maine Black Bears First Maine’s mascot is named Bananas which is absolutely wonderful. Legend has it that the local police chief loaned a bear cub named Jeff to the university in 1914. When Jeff stood on his head at a football rally the crowd went “bananas.” That’s just great stuff. Maine’s logo is half-cast in shadow and mid-roar contrasting with a typical black bear’s lack of aggression. The university could stand to freshen up the font behind the bear which looks slightly outdated. Back in 2013 Maine made the ‘Cats (ranked No. 18 at the time) work for a 35-21 win. 4. Towson Tigers Once known as the Knights student John Schuerholz pushed for Towson to become the Tigers in 1962. Sixty-one years later the Tigers prowl the CAA and Schuerholz is enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame as a front office executive. Towson’s logo takes me back to the mid-2000s before minimalism wreaked havoc upon graphic design. The bottoms of the “T” and “N” end in a sharp point like a tiger’s teeth and the motion lines coming off the cat itself look great. NU took the Battle of the Cats in a 47-14 blowout in 2009. 3. Western Illinois Leathernecks Both the name “Leathernecks” and bulldog logo are rooted in the U.S. Marine Corps. In 1927  head coach Ray Hanson gained permission to use the two symbols as homage to his service in World War I. Oh and he was also the athletic director and coach of the baseball and basketball teams — Hanson had a lot of influence. The bulldog’s three-quarter profile stares deep into your soul while bearing its teeth. Plus the combination of purple and yellow is a refreshing look. The Wildcats soundly beat the Leathernecks in a 24-7 result in 2014.  2. Howard Bison The current Bison logo has only been in use since 2015 when Howard differentiated itself from the Buffalo Bills. The HBCU’s transition from a charging side profile to a head-on look worked in its favor — the university now has a unique emblem to call its own. The ominous logo consists of an eye-pleasing combination of navy storm blue and white. It’s an excellent silhouette for a team looking to make headway in the MEAC. The Bison will square off against the ‘Cats on Saturday during homecoming weekend. 1. Southern Illinois Salukis Southern Illinois features one of the most unique FCS mascots and its logo is a perfect blend of style and realism. As one of the world’s fastest dogs the saluki meshes with a football team that wants to get out and run. Plus the history behind the mascot’s selection is rich — Southern Illinois is known as Little Egypt for its fertile land. The saluki is the royal dog of Egypt and is just one example of honoring the region’s history. Who can’t say no to a good dog? The Salukis let the ‘Cats out of the bag in a 33-7 loss in 2008 but they shocked the purple-and-white last season in a 31-24 upset. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story On Monday Northwestern lacrosse officially announced via Instagram the addition of attacker Mary Schumar to the Wildcats’ roster for the 2024 season. Schumar spent the last four seasons playing for Marquette University and comes to Evanston for her fifth year of eligibility which was given to all NCAA spring sport athletes who competed during the 2020 season shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic. A post shared by Northwestern Lacrosse (@nu_lax) Schumar a 2023 Inside Lacrosse and USA Lacrosse All-American Honorable Mention led the NCAA in both assists (69) and assists per game (3.63) during the 2023 season. She set a Marquette program record for most career assists (115) with nearly half of those coming from her senior season. In addition she also scored 20 goals and started all 19 games for the Golden Eagles. Last season Schumar was part of a Marquette team that finished 15-4 overall and made its first-ever NCAA Tournament appearance. “Mary is a tireless worker and tremendous playmaker. She makes connections on and off the field with ease” Northwestern head coach Kelly Amonte-Hiller said of Schumar. “In 2023 Mary led her Marquette team to the best season in the history of the program. We are thrilled to welcome her into the Lake Show.” Given how well Northwestern utilized its fifth-year transfers Hailey Rhatigan and Molly Laliberty last season this begs the question — what kind of role will Schumar have on the upcoming season’s Wildcats team? For Marquette last season Schumar served as the team’s assist machine. She had three times as many assists as anyone else on her squad and was the only player on the Golden Eagles’ roster to tally more assists than goals. In fact her role as a feeder was put on display during Marquette’s match against Northwestern last February where she recorded eight assists (her second-highest single-game total of the season) — a higher number than any of her teammates recorded in goals that game. From the video you can see that Schumar (No. 14) is often positioned behind the net which is where she dishes out a good portion of her assists. Schumar’s role as Marquette’s primary assist-maker is an interesting one to pick apart considering that Northwestern has a nationally prominent version of its own: Erin Coykendall whose return for a fifth year was confirmed by Amonte-Hiller on The Player and The Journalist podcast. Coykendall ranked fifth in the nation last season with 50 assists and notably nearly 40% of those assists (19 of 50) were for Izzy Scane the Wildcats’ top goal-scorer. That being said while Schumar and Coykendall both led their respective teams in assists last season they are very different players. Though Schumar had considerably more assists than goals Coykendall’s goal-to-assist ratio was very much even as she recorded 58 goals last season. In addition Coykendall did not dominate the team’s assist numbers — she only accounted for 28% of her team’s assists compared to Schumar’s 45%. If Schumar ends up on Northwestern’s starting roster how she will contribute to the team could be somewhat similar to what Rhatigan’s role was last year. Even though Northwestern already had a prolific goal creator in Scane before Rhatigan came along Rhatigan’s addition to the roster did not take away from Scane’s goal-scoring opportunities. The Tewaaraton winner ended up scoring a career-high number of goals last season while Rhatigan made the Wildcat attack even better with 62 goals of her own. Similarly Schumar could give that same boost to the Wildcats with her passing ability. Now Northwestern will not just have one major opportunity-creator in Coykendall but two with the addition of Schumar. It’s also worth noting that Schumar isn’t the only Northwestern grad transfer with the potential to impact the starting lineup as midfielder Linsdey Frank from Richmond (who also plays field hockey) will also join the roster this upcoming season. Though Northwestern lacrosse doesn’t play in official competition until next spring we will be able to take our first look at the 2024 squad in less than two weeks as the Wildcats take on both the Team USA and Canada U-20 squads at the USA Lacrosse Fall Classic on Oct. 14.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Nearly three months since the initial two-week suspension Northwestern is still dealing with the fallout of the hazing scandal that rocked the university. Former Northwestern football head coach Pat Fitzgerald filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the university in Cook County Court on Wednesday morning Fitzgerald’s attorney Dan Webb announced at a press conference. Fitzgerald who had over $42 million left on his contract at the time of his termination was fired for cause on July 10. In the initial filing Fitzgerald and his legal team claim that Northwestern breached its contract with the former head coach and defamed his character. Fitzgerald is seeking over $130 million in damages. “Mr. Fitzgerald has been subjected to unfair arbitrary and disgraceful conduct by both the university and its president” Webb said in a statement. “Despite no new evidence of hazing and despite a thorough factual investigation by Northwestern finding that Mr. Fitzgerald had no knowledge of any hazing conduct the defendants unlawfully terminated his employment and destroyed his good name and reputation. “The defendants’ actions have exacted terrible measurable costs to Mr. Fitzgerald and his family. This lawsuit seeks to bring some measure of justice for our client and to hopefully dissuade the defendants from inflicting such harm on others.” Fitzgerald was first suspended two weeks after a report produced by ArentFox Schiff’s Maggie Hickey concluded that “the investigation team did not discover sufficient evidence to believe that coaching staff knew about the ongoing hazing conduct.  “They determined however that there had been significant opportunities to discover and report the hazing conduct.”  However after reports from The Daily Northwestern Inside NU and other publications detailed sexual hazing inside the football program NU president Michael Schill reversed the initial suspension and terminated Fitzgerald. “The hazing we investigated was widespread and clearly not a secret within the program providing Coach Fitzgerald with the opportunity to learn what was happening” Schill wrote in a letter to the Northwestern community on July 10. “As much as Coach Fitzgerald has meant to our institution and our student-athletes we have an obligation — in fact a responsibility — to live by our values even when it means making difficult and painful decisions such as this one. We must move forward.” In response to the lawsuit NU spokesperson Jon Yates issued a statement on behalf of the University. He emphasized that Fitzgerald’s position as head coach made him “responsible for the conduct of the program” and that the accounts of several student-athletes showed “beyond question that hazing — which included nudity and sexualized acts — took place on Fitzgerald’s watch.” “The safety of our students remains our highest priority and we deeply regret that any student-athletes experienced hazing” Yates concluded. “We remain confident that the University acted appropriately in terminating Fitzgerald and we will vigorously defend our position in court.” ""Just received a statement from Northwesterns spokesman Jon Yates in response to Pat Fitzgeralds wrongful termination lawsuit.Yates says “We remain confident that the University acted appropriately in terminating Fitzgerald and we will vigorously defend our position in court.” pic.twitter.com/2vWtluITtO"" Fitzgerald spent the past 17 years at the helm of the Wildcats leading the program to two Big Ten West championships and 10 bowl appearances.

Share this story The field hockey world has been warned. No. 2 Northwestern (12-1 5-0 B1G) smothered No. 3 Iowa (10-2 2-2 B1G) in a 2-0 victory Friday afternoon. The Wildcats outshot the Hawkeyes 14-5 and won the penalty corner battle 10-1. Ilse Tromp opened the scoring early in the third quarter with a beautiful goal off of Northwestern’s sixth penalty corner of the day. Lauren Wadas the defending Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week added a goal in the fourth quarter on a solo breakaway. As for Iowa goalkeeper Mia Magnotta tallied 9 saves but couldn’t fully hold up against a relentless Wildcat attack. Dionne van Aalsum the nation’s leading scorer was held without a shot in 51 minutes. The Wildcats drew their first penalty corner just under two minutes into the game but the Hawkeye defense managed to block the shot by Ilse Tromp and quickly took the ball the other way. On Northwestern’s next breakaway freshman phenom Olivia Bent-Cole took a hard fall and came up limping but remained in the game.  The Hawkeyes’ first true threat came with just over nine minutes to play in the first quarter but Sofie Stribos’ pass dribbled harmlessly across the face of the goal and Northwestern was able to stifle the threat. About four minutes later Alia Marshall fired a shot at Hawkeye goalkeeper Mia Magnotta but Magnotta deflected it away. Marshall was able to collect the rebound and try again but once again Magnotta was able to stymie the midfielder’s scoring attempt. With just two minutes to play in the opening frame Bent-Cole showcased her speed to get past the defense and run a break. With the defense drawn to her she was able to find Chloe Relford on a quick pass but Relford couldn’t capitalize on the opportunity. Her shot was saved by Magnotta and the top-three squads went into the quarter break knotted in a scoreless tie. The second quarter was also dominated by the Wildcats. Despite sitting at second in the country in goals per game heading in Iowa totaled just one shot in the first 51 minutes. A big reason for that was Northwestern defensive pressure in the attacking zone and midfield with the ‘Cats constantly swooping in and forcing turnovers.  Just over halfway through the quarter Bent-Cole forced yet another turnover this one from inside the shooting circle. She shook her defender and got a good look but the shot was wide left. Less than a minute later Northwestern garnered two penalty corners in an 11-second span. Unfortunately for the Wildcats both attempts by Lauren Wadas were saved by Magnotta who upped her save count to five.  With two minutes to play in the first half Northwestern earned its fifth penalty corner of the afternoon. Lane Herbert failed to control the ball well enough to get a good shot but NU managed to get the ball back within 30 seconds anyway. Iowa took it back over and managed to push forth one final attack in the first half but a loose ball in the shooting circle bounced harmlessly over the goal (thanks to Annabel Skubisz) and the teams went to halftime with goose eggs on the scoreboard. The first 30 minutes were almost completely dominated by the Wildcats. Iowa totaled just one shot in the first half and it wasn’t even on goal. Northwestern had seven five of which were on goal. All five were saved by Magnotta who was one of the only reasons the Wildcats failed to break through in the first half. The clearest example of domination: Northwestern had five corners in the first half; Iowa had none. Yet despite the domination the ‘Cats failed to open the scoring in the first half-hour.  It was on the sixth penalty corner that the Wildcats finally broke through. Tromp who had a shot blocked in the first half got a beautiful setup from Lauren Hunter and blasted the ball straight into the back of the net. Northwestern led 1-0 just 80 seconds into the second half. The goal Tromp’s third of the season was the first breakthrough of over 30 minutes of Northwestern domination.  After a green card on Iowa’s Jacey Wittel eight minutes into the half Northwestern would earn its eighth penalty corner of the game a minute later. Magnotta was able to get her leg in front of the shot by Herbert but the constant pressure by the Wildcats would not let up. With two minutes to play in the third quarter Bent-Cole once again broke free but Magnotta stood tall and denied yet another Wildcat attack. The shot was Northwestern’s eighth of the game on the goal and marked Magnotta’s seventh save. But despite her brilliance (and a green card on Wadas) Northwestern took a 1-0 lead into the final 15 minutes thanks to Tromp’s goal. The dominance continued in the final frame. Wadas sliced through half the Iowa defense going right then went across her body towards the left side of the goal. Magnotta was helpless to stop it and No. 2 had doubled the lead with her second goal of the season just over three-and-a-half minutes into the fourth quarter. Over seven minutes into the fourth quarter Iowa earned its first penalty corner of the game. The Hawkeyes put up two shots — their first and second on goal of the day — but both were gobbled up by Skubisz including a beautiful kick save on the second attempt.  The Wildcats of course could not let this threat to their dominance stand. In a 16-second span two minutes later the ‘Cats totaled two penalty corners with Wadas nearly adding a second goal to her daily total. Iowa continued their scoring efforts but consecutive shots with over three minutes to go were denied by Skubisz. A minute later Iowa finally got on the board though not without controversy. Northwestern initiated a video review and the goal was disallowed after video replay showed the ball redirected off of Iowa forward Rachel Herbine. The shutout remained alive much to the dismay of the home team and its supporters.  With under 90 seconds to go Greta Hinke received a green card meaning Northwestern would be a player down to close the game. It didn’t matter. Iowa probably would have needed about two extra players to match up with the Wildcats Friday. An offense that puts up over four goals per game was held scoreless and the end result was a Wildcat win streak that hit 12. The streak is the longest for Northwestern’s field hockey program since 1990.  The Wildcats will return to action next Sunday Oct. 15 when they take on Ohio at Lakeside Field.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Welcome back to the film room everybody. After an improbable comeback against the Golden Gophers the Wildcats faced a much taller task in No. 6 Penn Sate. While Northwestern went toe-to-toe with the Nittany Lions in the first half PSU pulled away in the final 30 minutes departing Evanston with a 41-13 victory. Northwestern’s offense could not get anything going all day accumulating a mere 175 total yards. The Nittany Lions’ D-line got after the quarterback last Saturday racking up 48 pressures. For Northwestern QB Ben Bryant it was a game where it was difficult to stay upright. In fact the veteran ended up leaving the game early after getting destroyed on a blindside sack. It was a game where NU’s offensive line was overmatched the ‘Cats’ signal-caller could not find a rhythm during the game.  The Numbers In his abbreviated appearance Bryant finished 14-for-25 for 122 yards and added a rushing touchdown as well. After averaging nearly eight yards per attempt against Minnesota Bryant fell back to under five yards per attempt against Penn State. For his efforts No. 2 earned a 50.5 PFF passing grade — his second-lowest grade of the season. According to PFF the sixth-year had zero big-time throws but also had zero turnover-worthy plays. Bryant felt the heat on Saturday being pressured on over 50% of his dropbacks and getting sacked five times. After having nearly three seconds to get rid of the ball against the Gophers the veteran had 2.68 seconds to throw this past weekend. When under duress the ‘Cats’ gunslinger completed just 25% of his passes and only for 2.5 yards per attempt. The sixth-year only attempted five passes more than 10 yards down the field hooking up with his target just once. Here is a breakdown of every throw from Bryant against PSU. The stats were not great for No. 2 and the ‘Cats against the Nittany Lions and the tape displayed a similar conclusion so let’s dive into the film. The Good When protected Bryant was efficient in delivering the football; however he was protected few and far between. With that let’s take a look at what NU’s starter did well. Bryant did not have a truly impressive throw the entire game mostly settling for screens and check down but I was encouraged by the sixth year’s use of the RPOs. This is a simple RPO backside slant but an absolute seed from Bryant. Penn State plays a seven-man box with man coverage on the outside. The key to an RPO is the linebackers and in this scenario the linebackers come downhill in run support and vacate the middle of the field. Bryant reads the backers and rifles a ball to Cam Johnson on the slant. Johnson has a defender draped all over him but the throw from the Cincinnati transfer puts it only where Johnson could get it.  This is the same exact concept as the previous play. The Nittany Lions’ linebackers once again played downhill in run support vacating the middle of the field and Johnson replaced them. This is not a difficult read and Bryant flicks the ball to No. 14 who does the rest. Penn State made it incredibly difficult to get anything going on offense so capitalizing on these opportunities was crucial for the Wildcats. While simple Bryant made the right decision each time. The ‘Cats’ signal-caller was running for his life on Saturday. Yet for a mobile quarterback Bryant showed off his wheels against the No. 6 Nittany Lions. I think I’ve said this more in the past two weeks than in two years but this is an excellent play call from Mike Bajakian and an even better job by NU’s quarterback. On this zone read Penn State brings a safety blitz who becomes the read key. Because the safety decides to hit Cam Porter Bryant pulls the ball and takes off. With no one around No. 2 scampers for the first down. Now I would like for him to avoid a massive hit at the end of the play but Bryant has surprised me with his ability to use his legs. It is not a big part of his game at all but he does just enough to make opposing defenses respect him as a running threat. The Bad There was not that much bad from a pure quarterback standpoint as Bryant was getting clobbered on each play. The ‘Cats’ starter found himself either throwing the ball away or throwing into tight coverage.  Bryant saw the grass throughout Saturday’s contest. Most of it was not his fault but the ‘Cats’ quarterback sped up his processing due to the constant pressure. This was the only play from Bryant on Saturday that made me let out a “what are you doing” in the press box. In a boot play call Bryant has plenty of space to continue to roll to his right to the open field; instead he spins backward right into the pressure and has to throw the ball away. The veteran needs to work to the open space and if no one is available take off and run. However because of the pressure he faced all day he bailed quickly and threw it away. It’s hard to play quarterback when you are constantly getting pummeled into the turf but NU needs its veteran QB to remain poised as the bullets fly around him. Final thoughts Truthfully there is so little to take away from Bryant’s play against No.6 Penn State. Because of the pressure throughout the game NU was limited to screens and check downs in the passing game. It felt like Bryant just never had a chance to scan the field and demonstrate his ability like he did against Minnesota. Outside of two drives one aided by an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty the ‘Cats were going backward instead of forward. Heading into Howard tomorrow it remains to be seen if Bryant will play. David Braun said he should be able to play but there has been no confirmation from Northwestern. If the sixth-year can go I expect he and the Wildcats’ offense will get back on track against the Bison.     \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Just yesterday the Big Ten released a football schedule for the next five seasons. With Washington and Oregon joining the conference which now tallies 18 teams the Big Ten debuted its “Flex Protect XVII” model which combines protected opponents and rotating matches to fill each season’s nine-game conference slate. Any protected rivalry game will be played each season and every other team in the conference will be played at least twice (one home one road) in a five-year period and no team shall be played more than three times in that window.  Northwestern vs. Illinois is among the 12 protected matchups but the battle for the Land of Lincoln Trophy is one of the few things that will stay the same. The division format is no more as the new system will be an 18-team melee with only the top two teams earning a chance to play for the Big Ten Championship. After years of the East Division clobbering the West this key change could open up room for a potential Ohio State vs. Michigan championship largely recognized as one of the fiercest rivalries in any sport.  Although possible that matchup will be difficult to achieve with four new teams joining the conference each of which has been ranked in the top 25 at some point this season. Currently the new-look Big Ten would have a whopping six teams in the AP top nine: Michigan (No. 2) Ohio State (No. 4) Penn State (No. 6) Washington (No. 7) Oregon (No. 8) and USC (No. 9). Starting in 2024 the Big Ten could very well be the best conference in college football.   The #B1G Announces      Future Football Schedule Format➕ https://t.co/hfPUYhaiqX pic.twitter.com/JZqcS2Fn0Q In 2024 Northwestern’s schedule has been noticeably altered from the previous model that was released prior to the conference’s expansion into the pacific northwest. The ‘Cats still get Indiana and Illinois at home but now play Wisconsin and Ohio State for the other two matchups in Evanston rather than Nebraska and USC. Overall mark that down as a downgrade especially under the assumption that Caleb Williams will be NFL-bound after this season. On the road Purdue is the only matchup that stuck from the previous edition. Now instead of traveling to Los Angeles for a UCLA matchup the team’s West Coast trip will be to Seattle to face a tougher opponent in Washington. Instead of Minnesota Penn State and Ohio State (who the team still plays now at home) the Wildcats face off against Maryland Michigan and Iowa. All in all I think Northwestern’s schedule definitely increased in difficulty but that is to be expected when two more powerhouses join the conference.   The #B1G Announces      Future Football Schedule Format➕ https://t.co/hfPUYhaiqX pic.twitter.com/ycxNCdE4dY In 2025 Northwestern faces a juggernaut of a schedule. Purdue at home remains the same but instead of Ohio State Maryland Rutgers and Wisconsin it will be Michigan Minnesota Oregon and UCLA coming to town. I’ll rule that as a wash to be generous. On the road the Illinois matchup is a constant but the other three matchups swap out Iowa Michigan State and Michigan (who the team still plays) for Nebraska Penn State and USC. Much like 2024 this schedule also increased in rigor and wins might be especially hard to come by if the team is playing in an off-site location as Ryan Field gets renovated.

The 2027 lineup stands out to me as the tamest of the bunch but still features tough matchups at home against Ohio State and Washington. If approved the new Ryan Field is projected to debut in 2026 when the team hosts four conference matchups. The team has also already scheduled Colorado and South Dakota State in the non-conference slate for 2026 leaving plenty of potential matchups for the venue’s debut.

Share this story In precisely one month Northwestern men’s basketball will look to do something never accomplished before in its lengthy program history: earn consecutive berths to the NCAA Tournament. In fact the Wildcats haven’t finished with a winning record in back-to-back years since 2017 the season of the school’s only other March Madness appearance. For the vast majority of the last few years expectations had bottomed out surrounding the ‘Cats with the team consistently picked to finish in the bottom half of the Big Ten. That’s starkly changed in advance of 2023-24 however. Fifth-year point guard Boo Buie was voted a preseason First-Team All-American by ESPN’s Dick Vitale while NCAA.com’s Andy Katz slotted Northwestern the 24th-best team in his post-NBA Draft withdrawal deadline power rankings. There are few who are more intimately aware of the perception surrounding NU men’s basketball than Chris Collins the team’s head coach since 2013-14. Having reached unprecedented zeniths yet experienced true doldrums Collins recognizes how outside attitude shifts can’t affect his team’s preparation. “It’s easy to have motivation when people tell you you’re bad or they pick you last or second-to-last” Collins said at the Chicagoland Media Tipoff Luncheon Wednesday. “But now when you come into a year and some of your players are being recognized and the program’s being more recognized and getting more respect you can’t soften up. You have to stay true to those habits.” The Wildcats’ 22-12 record including a second-place finish in the Big Ten and trip to the Round of 32 in Sacramento California captivated audiences around the country. Stunning wins over No. 1 Purdue Indiana Iowa Illinois and many more left fans of the purple and white nearly euphoric after six years of frustration and futility. Although the ‘Cats return four of their top six players minutes-wise from that magical campaign Collins emphasized not resting his laurels on last season. “I think our older guys have done a great job of understanding that every team is new” Collins said. “You have to start over. We really made that point coming into the summer. We can’t just fast forward to get back to March. We’ve got to re-establish our culture our habits.” Six years ago Collins transformed from a Mike Krzyzewski understudy to a bonafide up-and-coming star at head coach when he took NU dancing for the first time ever. But the ensuing season was rife with disappointment: Northwestern finished 15-17 and 6-12 in Big Ten play in 2017-18. Collins — who signed a three-year extension in May — reflected on his own growth and how he’s adapted since that season. “Looking back I think I didn’t do as good a job kind of moving on toward the next thing” Collins said. “Certainly there were other things involved as well but it doesn’t take much to lose that edge or lose that hunger.” One of those “other things” tough to ignore was the remodeling of Welsh-Ryan Arena which began in March after Northwestern’s inaugural postseason trip; consequently the ‘Cats played home games at Allstate Arena in Rosemont 14 miles and 35 minutes away from their typical venue. This time around though Collins and his team can remain in its usual abode — where fans lined up hours in advance of tip and were still turned away. “I hope they’re going to be great” Collins said about home crowds. “What it became in the conference season was awesome. I think we showed it can be a really tough place to play and a fun night for students to come out. “I’m hoping from our first game of the year that we can have that same kind of energy and the students will stick with us. No offense to the other people who come but the students are the lifeblood of the home games. I hope we can pack those student sections every night.” Northwestern’s roster did experience some turnover of its own with the departures of mainstays Chase Audige and Robbie Beran plus other impact players such as Tydus Verhoeven and Julian Roper II leaving. Consequently Collins added three high-upside players in the transfer portal in guard Ryan Langborg (Princeton) guard Justin Mullins (Denver) and forward Blake Preston (Liberty). “We felt like they all presented a need in our roster” Collins remarked. “All three are going to have big roles. We’re excited about all of them.” More specifically the head coach touted Mullins’ “length and athleticism” Langborg’s “ability to put the ball in the hole” while still making plays and Preston mirroring Verhoeven’s role of “being an older guy who played defense and brought toughness and dirty work.” Another player that Collins and a multitude of national pundits is eager to watch is junior guard Brooks Barnhizer. Subsequent to a season including nine games with 10+ points 168 rebounds and a 41% field goal percentage many are projecting Barnhizer to transform from well-kept secret into full-fledged star. “Now as he takes the floor he’s carrying himself like an elite player” Collins noted. “He’s such a unique guy; you can literally play him all over. I think he’s excited about the opportunity. That’s what college is about: you figure out your role when you’re young and you get better. Now he knows he’s going to be thrust into a key role where he’s going to be counted on every night.” On top of general roster and rotational consistency Northwestern will return its entire 2022-23 coaching staff which incorporated Big Ten Assistant Coach of the Year Chris Lowery. The team’s head coach expressed how “fortunate” he was to have the same expertise around him. “It’s huge for camaraderie; it’s huge for chemistry” Collins said about his coaching cohesion. “I think we all know how to lean on each other. Everybody brings different skillsets to the table; I think it meshes really well. When you see a together staff that is all moving in the same direction with the same message the players [follow] suit.” On Nov. 6 the Wildcats begin a season with 31 opportunities on the docket to prove their mettle in another vaunted Big Ten conference. Although the glamor of last year’s March Madness run won’t be forgotten any time soon for people following Northwestern those inside the program have already reset — with eyes toward a future that could be even more promising. “We turned the page” Collins said. “We can talk about it at the reunions when that [2022-23] team comes back. Right now it’s about moving forward; it’s about staying tough. Continuing to be hungry. We know how good the Big Ten is; we know what’s in front of us. I think our guys are excited to get going and kind of re-establish what this group can be — and be a new team.” \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Both the men’s and women’s golf teams thrived last weekend highlighted by exceptional final rounds. The men finished tied for second at the Fighting Irish Classic and the women’s team placed solo second in the Windy City Collegiate Classic.  Men’s Golf Coming off a sixth-place finish at the Windon Memorial Classic and a top-five result at the Gopher Invitational Northwestern entered the Fighting Irish Classic with a solid start to the season. It continued that success as it tied for second place in the 14-team tournament. However most notably sophomore Ethan Tseng won the individual event shooting 8-under par. In addition to Tseng’s great performance sophomore Daniel Svärd had an outstanding three rounds finishing in solo fourth at 4-under. Tseng started the event slowly carding a 2-over par 72 in round one. In round two Tseng vaulted up the leaderboard with a 2-under 68 highlighted by an eagle at the par-5 17th. Heading into the final round Tseng was four back of his teammate Svärd and Purdue’s Herman Sekne the winner of the Windon Memorial Classic. Tseng started off the final round strong holing out for eagle on the par-4 3rd hole. After a run of birdies on holes 12-14 he was tied for the lead. Following a birdie at the 17th Tseng took a one-shot lead over Tennessee’s Caleb Surratt. Closing out with a par on the 18th he shot an 8-under par 62. Not only tying a Northwestern 18-hole record 62 Tseng was also able to come out on top for his first collegiate win. Svärd secured a top-four finish highlighted by a terrific 3-under first round. The reigning Big Ten Freshman of the Year had a stretch of seven birdies in a span of 10 holes during day one. Svärd shot 1-under 69 in the second round to take a share of the lead. After a birdie at the 17th in Round Three Svärd ended the day at even-par and in an excellent position: solo fourth place. Graduate student James Imai junior Cameron Adam first-year Archie Finnie and first-year Niall Shiels-Donegan also competed. Imai and Finnie finished tied for 32nd Adam tied for 36th and Shiels-Donegan was 77th. As a team the Wildcats shot a 3-over par first round. The leader of the pack after 18 holes was Svärd shooting 4-under. However after round one they were in ninth place. In round two the ‘Cats compiled a 2-under par day led by Tseng contributing 2-under.  Going into the final round Northwestern was in third place five shots behind Indiana. The ‘Cats started the round off strong as they were a combined 7-under par through five holes. The back nine proved to be more difficult and they finished 4-under for the day and 3-under for the tournament. Tennessee took control of the final round and shot 10-under as a team to win the event. The Wildcats finished tied for second with Indiana and the team will be back in action on Oct. 13-15 to play in the Golf Club of Georgia Collegiate Invitational. Women’s Golf After a disappointing tie for 12th place finish in the Branch Law Firm/Dick McGuire Invitational the ‘Cats hosted the Windy City Collegiate Classic at the Glen View Club. The tournament hosted a stacked field with five of the top eight teams in the country participating. The Wildcats had an excellent week finishing second in the 15-team tournament. Northwestern was led by junior Lauryn Nguyen who after a terrific three rounds won the individual event at 11-under par. Nguyen shot 6-under par in round one after a superb 4-under three-hole stretch from the seventh through the ninth. After 18 holes Nguyen was tied for second two shots behind Texas’ Farah O’Keefe. Nguyen continued her quality play with a 2-under par 70 in the second round and was tied with O’Keefe going into the final day. After making four pars to start her day Nguyen holed out from the fairway on the fifth hole for eagle. She went on to finish the day at 3-under par winning her first collegiate tournament by two strokes over O’Keefe and Meghan Royal from UCLA.  Senior Jennifer Cai had a solid tournament tying for 20th at 4-under par in large part due to a solid 3-under par first round. First-year Ashley Yun finished in a tie for 27th place after a strong final round that included a stretch of three birdies in four holes. Senior Jieni Li sophomores Dianna Lee and Jiayi Wang and first-year Sarah Thornton also participated in the event. Lee finished tied for 34th at 2-under par Li tied for 49th at 2-over par while Wang and Thornton tied for 74th and 80th respectively. The team began the tournament with a 9-under par 279 led by Nguyen who shot 6-under par. The ‘Cats were in a tie for second place with Georgia after round one; however they were seven strokes behind UCLA. The Bruins shot a blistering 16-under par to take a commanding lead in the tournament. The Wildcats had a solid second round as they shot 6-under par as a team. They were led by Lee who shot a bogey free 5-under par. Northwestern went into the final round in solo second place nine shots behind UCLA.  In need of a great day to catch the Bruins the ‘Cats shot 8-under par to finish at 23-under. While they weren’t able to catch UCLA at 32-under the team was able to secure solo second place in their second tournament of the season. Northwestern returns next week on Oct. 9 and 10 to play in the Illini Invitational.

Share this story Northwestern (3-3 1-2 B1G) took down Howard (2-3) 23-20 on Saturday to move to a .500 record on the season but it wasn’t without some last-minute excitement.  Northwestern the heavy favorite got out to a 16-0 lead in the first half but the game was just a field goal away from being tied with minutes left in the game. Brendan Sullivan slotted in for Ben Bryant who was sidelined against Penn State went 13-for-18 over 131 yards and rushed for a touchdown himself. Cam Porter played a major role in the win rushing for 78 yards. Cam Johnson and Bryce Kirtz also tallied 55 and 41 receiving yards respectively. Quinton Williams led the way for Howard going 18-for-30 over 169 yards. Eden James also contributed 177 rushing yards and Richie Ilarraza snagged 65 yards on the day. Sullivan may have been a bit of a surprise in the QB slot but he wasted no time getting the ‘Cats on the board in NU’s opening drive. Northwestern easily got two first downs to cross midfield with charges from Porter and passes to Johnson and Kirtz. The sequence set up Sullivan’s 35-yard touchdown less than five minutes into the game.  The Wildcats’ defense quickly halted the Bison’s first possession but the offense was unable to capitalize. Hunter Renner then booted a punt that left Howard to take over from its own 3-yard line.  Pinning the Bison proved worthwhile for the ‘Cats. On third down Xander Mueller pounced on Williams in the end zone. Intentional grounding was called on Williams resulting in a safety and a 9-0 ‘Cats’ lead.  Following a kick and re-kick from the Bison Porter opened up the drive with a 5-yard gain but the ‘Cats were forced to punt after Sullivan rushed for a loss and was taken down by Clayton Perrin on the next two opportunities. The Bison were finally able to move the chains for the first time but once again were forced into punting. On two subsequent attempts Porter got NU a first down. An incomplete pass and another sack on Sullivan seemed like a punt fest would begin but an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty from Howard moved Northwestern across the 50-yard line. A false start put the ‘Cats back but a 23-yard pass to Kirtz powered them right back forward to regain positioning at the end of the first quarter. On third and long Sullivan was sacked again forcing NU to punt. Howard seemed to start gaining momentum achieving two straight first downs and making it to the Northwestern 49-yard line — its first-time past midfield but ultimately the Bison found themselves punting again. Northwestern found similar luck on its next drive.  Howard put up more of a fight the next time around. On two sequences the Bison moved 46 yards before turning it over on downs. That was the closest they had been to the end zone all day.  Beginning on their own 23-yard line NU picked up the pace to convert on downs for the first time in the second quarter. A combination of 35 rushing yards from Porter and passes to Johnson and Joseph Himon II accelerated the ‘Cats to the opposing 14-yard line. Sullivan ran the ball for five yards and sent a short pass to Charlie Mangieri to set up a Northwestern first-and-goal with 34 seconds left in the half. A short pass to Kirtz put the Purple and White on the board once more to close out the half 16-0.  Over the course of a long drive the Bison entered striking distance halfway through the third quarter.  On third-and-seven at the Northwestern 8-yard line Williams passed to Ilarraza who ran toward the end zone. The original touchdown call was erased putting the Bison on the 2-yard line.  Northwestern was called for disconcerting signals before Howard could try again. Howard substituted Williams for Ja’Shawn Scroggins who ended the nearly eight-minute drive with a touchdown.   The Wildcats put Porter to work on their next drive with him running the ball on five of eight plays. After an impressive catch by Johnson was wiped out by a penalty NU was pushed back to the 35-yard line. Johnson was able to avenge the mishap with a 35-yard touchdown pass from Sullivan to extend the lead 23-7. Howard was able to make it to the Northwestern 9-yard line to start the fourth quarter but was unable to score — largely thanks to back-to-back sacks from Richie Hagarty and Mueller. Northwestern found itself in very a similar situation later in the fourth quarter as it was unable to convert on a fourth down attempt that ended with Sullivan being sacked. Despite being on the opposite end of the field the Bison just needed one play to punch it in with James scoring on a 64-yard run to make it 23-13 with less than six minutes to play.  And with that came the energy and motivation for a last-minute push from the Bison.  After a three-and-out from NU Howard regained possession on its own 37-yard line. A combination of passes from Williams and rushes from James moved the Bison down the field to the 1-yard line where Hunter Jarret ran it in for a score.  At 23-20 the ‘Cats were able to fend off the Bison to preserve their lead and win their third game of the season.

Share this story After a 41-13 home loss to No. 6 Penn State last week Northwestern bounced back to defend its home field with a 23-20 victory over Howard. The ‘Cats started strong and took a 16-0 lead into halftime which was just enough of a cushion to hold off a late-game surge by the Bison. Stock Up:  Brendan Sullivan’s legs Northwestern started off the game with a 6-play 75-yard touchdown drive and Sullivan accounted for 64 total yards on that drive with 42 of them coming on the ground. He completed his first two passes for first downs and then scrambled for seven yards before scoring a 35-yard TD to get the ‘Cats on the board early. The next two drives were rough as Northwestern had two consecutive three-and-outs but Sullivan’s ability to stay mobile saved Northwestern important yardage in multiple situations where the offensive line allowed pressure to get through. During the opening drive of the second half Sullivan used his legs to get a crucial first down on a 3rd-and-2 run. Later in that same drive Sullivan sensed incoming pressure pointed to Cam Johnson to take his route up the field and as Sullivan scrambled out of the pocket he hit Johnson in stride with a 35-yard touchdown pass that put the ‘Cats up 23-7 and acted as the final nail in the coffin. Sullivan’s scrambles accounted for a lot of the ‘Cats offense once it was all said and done. Northwestern’s run defense Howard tried to get its offense going on the ground but Northwestern wasn’t having any of it. The Bison were forced to throw on their first six third downs but only converted two of them and one of them turned into a safety as well. The run defense put Howard behind the chains and even when Howard had an opportunity to run it on a 4th-and-2 Northwestern came up with a stop as well.  Even when Howard generated a scoring drive Howard scored as a result of 57 passing yards on nine attempts. Northwestern’s run defense gave up just 16 yards on eight carries on that opening drive of the second half as the defensive line held strong. Howard did catch Northwestern by surprise on a 64-yard touchdown run late in the fourth quarter but ignoring that one explosive play Howard tallied 119 rushing yards on 35 carries (a low average of 3.4 yards per carry). Cam Porter Porter was dealt a bad hand with how the offensive line was playing throughout the day but he continued to get positive yardage on the ground despite some shady blocking. Porter had 12 carries for 58 yards (a healthy 4.8 yards per carry) in the first half despite having many short caries that were blown up in the backfield for a loss or no-gain by free rushers for Howard. In the second half Porter only got six carries as Northwestern gave more carries to Anthony Tyus III and Joseph Himon and the game seemed already out of hand. Honorable mentions: Rod Heard II Special Teams Bryce Kirtz Xander Mueller Cam Johnson Stock Down: Offensive communication Several times in this game (especially early on) there were clear miscommunications between Sullivan and Porter that proved to be costly for the Wildcats. Sullivan fumbled early on as he appeared to try to pull the ball out on a read option play and Northwestern got put behind the chains and eventually was forced to punt. Sullivan was also sacked on a broken play where he expected Porter to be on his left side for a handoff while Porter was actually on his right.  There were also a few other unsuccessful option plays throughout the game that were influenced by bad reads from Sullivan. Sullivan also held the ball too long on an RPO leading to the negation of an incredible one-handed catch by Cam Johnson because the offensive line crept too far downfield. Everything seemed a bit out of sorts compared to when Ben Bryant has been under center this season.  The Offensive Line Northwestern had the worst rushing offense in the Big Ten heading into the week in terms of yards per game. This week the ‘Cats had an opportunity to establish the ground game against an opponent that is weak compared to the run defenses Northwestern will face in the Big Ten. The ‘Cats still struggled to win in the trenches however as Howard tallied three sacks and four tackles for loss in the first half alone.  Without some great individual plays by Sullivan and Porter things would look even worse on the stat sheet for Northwestern’s line. Of course Northwestern put points on the board comfortably but the ‘Cats would have run up the score even more than they actually did if Sullivan had better protection and Porter had easier holes to run through.

Share this story Northwestern looks to get back on track against a non-FBS team on homecoming when the Wildcats welcome in the Howard Bison. Our staff writers are confident in the Wildcats to even their record and reach .500 entering the team’s bye week. Iggy Dowling: Northwestern 34 Howard 10 If Ben Bryant can’t go it might be a little closer but Northwestern should be able to move the ball easily against the Bison considering how the ‘Cats fared against UTEP. Bradley Locker: Northwestern 31 Howard 12 Northwestern has already exorcised its demons against non-FBS teams and that continues against the Bison. As long as the Wildcats can avoid turnovers — which they’ve done well through five games totaling only five — they should have a considerable talent advantage in the line scrimmage in both directions. A cleaner pocket for Ben Bryant/Brendan Sullivan should translate to offensive rhythm and even a strong day for Cam Porter while I expect Northwestern’s defensive line to post better pressure and sack numbers against Howard’s OL. David Gold: Northwestern 45 Howard 21 For the first time since 2020 the Wildcats will break the 40-point mark against the Bisons. After getting demolished by the Nittany Lions last week I believe that NU’s O-line will come out with a vengeance and against inferior talent move Howard off the line of scrimmage. Expect Cam Porter to have his first 100-yard rushing performance since 2020 making it an easy day for whoever is under center for the ‘Cats. Howard’s offense should be able to get some points on the board but I think Northwestern will cruise to a homecoming victory. Ethan Segall: Northwestern 38 Howard 14 On alumni weekend Northwestern should enjoy one of its greatest home-field advantages of the season. Ryan Field should be packed with alumni eager to see a win in the historical venue the Wildcats may bid adieu after this season. If the offense is able to avoid turning the ball over they should be able to control the flow of the game. I fully expect the ‘Cats to move to .500 going into the bye week on the back of a strong performance from Cam Porter and the run game. Natalie Wells: Northwestern 27 Howard 13 I see the ‘Cats getting back to .500 with a convincing victory over the Bison. NU dominated FBS bottom-feeder UTEP in Week Two so they shouldn’t have too much of an issue against a 2-2 FCS team. Whoever starts at quarterback should fare well against a Howard defense with just four sacks on the season. Look for the purple-and-white to get right on homecoming weekend. Ascher Levin: Northwestern 35 Howard 7 Following a loss against Penn State I’m still encouraged about the team. Northwestern was tied with sixth-ranked Penn State going into halftime and the game was closer than the final score indicated. This week the Wildcats are taking on Howard an FCS team. Northwestern has the opportunity to build confidence by improving its running game and run defense. The Wildcats didn’t have much of a run game versus Penn State only gaining 45 yards on 32 carries. While Howard has played its opponents close all year it hasn’t played any team at the level of Northwestern and the Wildcats will go 3-3 heading into their bye. Patrick Winograd: Northwestern 35 Howard 14 Northwestern shouldn’t have any trouble with Howard and I am not predicting that the ‘Cats will either. I think the Wildcats (regardless of which quarterback starts) will pick up a comfortable win against Howard to get back to .500 before a bye week and the remainder of the Big Ten slate. Ashleigh Provoost: Northwestern 35 Howard 10 The Wildcats have managed to give me enough confidence in these past five weeks to make me think the team will have a comfortable 2-0 in the non-conference season this year. Yes last year’s non-conference play didn’t exactly bode well but the ‘Cats have proved themselves. I don’t think they should encounter too much of a challenge this week. Noah Poser: Northwestern 38 Howard 10 Howard has played one FBS team this season. It was Eastern Michigan. The Bison put up a fight in that game but ultimately lost 33-23. They also lost to Hampton a fellow FCS team. Like with UTEP a few weeks ago Northwestern is easily the best opponent Howard has played this season. It’s also homecoming and alumni weekend for the Wildcats so the home crowd should be more active than usual. The Bison have a good quarterback in senior Quinton Williams but it won’t be enough to save them. Northwestern wins big. Adam Beck: Northwestern 30 Howard 23 This game is going to be a lot closer than anybody in purple would like. Howard’s offense has weapons and more importantly a solid rushing attack — something Northwestern’s had no answers for all season long. The Bison will grab an early 10-3 lead but the ‘Cats will claw back with Ben Bryant tossing two touchdowns and Cam Porter rushing for another.

Share this story Somehow even after a 28-point loss to Penn State it feels as if Northwestern has some momentum heading into its homecoming matchup against Howard. The Wildcats have already doubled their win total from last year — in convincing fashion against UTEP and in tenacious fashion against Minnesota — and despite last week’s final score the ‘Cats can say they competed neck-in-neck with a playoff contender (albeit for only two quarters). Nearing the season’s halfway point a win over Howard would push Northwestern’s record back to the .500 mark and here’s the best part: Northwestern is a heavy favorite. ESPN Analytics has given the ‘Cats a 98% chance of emerging victorious on Saturday putting David Braun and his squad in a position they haven’t been in too often this year.  In the final matchup of a three-game home stand Northwestern looks to seize the unlikely momentum and win a very winnable game. Here’s what the ‘Cats have to do to win on Saturday and what they would have to do to lose.  Tight Pass Coverage There were quite a few factors that kept last week’s Penn State game so close at halftime. Some of it was grit some of it was pure luck but a lot of it was the impressive showing from Northwestern’s defense — especially the secondary. Drew Allar one of the top QBs in the Big 10 was held to a mere 50% completion rating by the end of the first half. For the duration of that first half Northwestern DBs were keeping him locked up —  his reads were taking longer than usual and oftentimes he struggled to find an open man. While much of that fell apart after the half Northwestern showed what it was capable of on defense against top-tier competition. This may remind some fans of the DB unit’s play last year when the Wildcat secondary was ranked top 50 in the nation. A similar play from the secondary tomorrow would put Northwestern in a great position to win on Saturday.  Let the playmakers make plays As this season has progressed we have seen different playmakers emerge for Northwestern’s offense. Against Minnesota it was Bryce Kirtz with a monster game putting up over 200 yards receiving with two touchdowns. Last week it was Cam Johnson who amassed season highs in receptions with six and yards with 81. When Northwestern has had success on offense this year it has been getting its best athletes in open space and letting them go to work. Michigan transfer A.J. Henning arguably the best athlete on the team has yet to have his breakout game as a Wildcat — maybe he can be the star against Howard.  Take advantage of Howard’s mistakes The very first play of last week’s Penn State game shows the significance of pouncing on opportunities when they are presented. On the opening kickoff the ‘Cats forced a fumble setting up a score and skewing the momentum in their favor for the entirety of the first half. Those are the types of plays that define football games and luckily for Northwestern Howard is a team that has given its opponents plenty of opportunities. In its opening week matchup Howard’s performance was riddled with avoidable mistakes that gave Eastern Michigan chances to seize control of the game. A punt snap flew into the back of the endzone for a safety and the Bison surrendered not one but two kick return TDs during the game. They found themselves in a deep hole early — one that would prove to be insurmountable. If the Bison make similar mistakes in Saturday’s affair the Wildcats need to strike.  Quinton Williams Coming off of his most efficient game this year Howard’s veteran quarterback Quinton Williams has been very reliable for the Bison all year. He was second-team All-MEAC in 2022 and in 2023 Howard has been able to trust him with the football. He’s only thrown one interception but he has also been able to flaunt his prowess with the deep ball. He won’t be a game-breaker but he certainly has the experience and talent to keep his squad in the game.  Lackluster run defense Northwestern’s run defense ranks in the bottom 30 of all FBS schools and has allowed a total of 524 yards in the three games the Wildcats have lost. Howard has a deep running back room — led by Jarrett Hunter and Ian Wheeler — that has explosive potential. In their win over Morehouse State the Bison rushed for nearly 400 yards. They probably won’t run for nearly 400 yards against Northwestern but if the ‘Cats don’t tighten up their ground defense they may have to pay the price.  Not taking Howard seriously While usually accustomed to playing the role of the underdog Northwestern sits on the other side this week as a heavy favorite to beat Howard. Many teams claim to prepare similarly regardless of opponent but Northwestern is going from being a 26.5-point underdog against Penn State to having a 98% chance to beat Howard. It is safe to say that the mental approach between the two is vastly different. Northwestern cannot underestimate Howard — a team with some talent and experience that would love to knock off a power five opponent.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story If you weren’t paying attention you should. Flying high on an 11-game winning streak a No. 2 Northwestern team headed into Iowa City last Friday to face its biggest test of the season. A 10-1 third-ranked Iowa team that led the country in goals per game and held the nation’s No. 1 spot for the season’s first four weeks awaited the Wildcats. Northwestern didn’t just pass that midterm it aced it with flying colors. NU’s 2-0 win looked much more dominant than the score indicated. With that here’s three takeaways from the victory and three reasons to be incredibly excited about the team’s prospects come November. Northwestern’s press up front is stifling Iowa averaged 10 shots on goal heading into this game. Mind you the Hawkeyes had already played four ranked teams on the road one of which included defending champion and current No. 1 North Carolina. Iowa managed just four shots on target once the final whistle blew and every single one came in the final nine minutes. It put up just one total in the first 51 which Annabel Skubisz didn’t even have to save because it was wide. This is the best offense in the country and Northwestern embarrassed it for the vast majority of this game. Looking at the shot total you’d figure that NU’s defense made that happen with a Herculean performance. While the backs played well that wasn’t the root of the shutout because Iowa rarely even approached the circle. It was Northwestern’s ferocious press from its forwards that constantly kept the ball in the Hawkeyes’ half. Sequences like these set the tone early: When Iowa was trying to establish some early first-half rhythm with short passes to get something going offensively NU didn’t let that happen. Olivia Bent-Cole and Peyton Halsey immediately kept Iowa’s Milly Short from getting some time to relax as they denied two of her three visible passing lanes on that first touch. Short had to telegraph that first pass which Chloe Relford quickly recognized. Relford’s immediate pressure led to a rushed sequence of passing and trying to find lanes and from there Wildcat defenders prevented any clear paths into the opposing half from opening. Lindsey Frank’s coverage forced All-American Esme Gibson right into Lauren Wadas who finally blew up the Iowa possession. It’s not flashy but it prevented the Hawkeyes from generating significant momentum on the other end. Northwestern dominated possession the entire game. Because of that Iowa had to attempt longer passes in the second half once the ‘Cats got on the board to try and make something happen.  Yet even when Tracey Fuchs’ team took the lead it didn’t stop pressing up. Bent-Cole constantly showcased her speed to force Iowa into sloppy passing sequences that led to quick turnovers. That in turn created more corners and scoring opportunities. It’s been Northwestern’s bread and butter all fall and no one’s really beat it yet. Even in NU’s lone loss against No. 5 Louisville which came in August it outshot the Cardinals 21-3. The forwards and midfielders are thriving both offensively and defensively in the attacking half which is a great sign given they’ve faced stellar competition already. Even when it isn’t at full strength Northwestern is deep enough to beat elite teams Sophomore back Maja Zivojnovic didn’t play against Iowa. She had become an unstoppable force on penalty corners putting up an absurd five goals and 17 shots on goal in her last three contests. Because of that it seemed like NU would be at a major disadvantage on scoring opportunities especially against a lethal offense like Iowa’s. The ‘Cats felt it early on. They drew five corners in the first half alone but couldn’t get on the board in the first 30 minutes. Even though Northwestern hadn’t allowed a single shot on goal it couldn’t capitalize on its dominance without Zivojnovic. It then came out of the break drew a corner in 60 seconds and responded with this: Beautiful no notes   pic.twitter.com/hGoXG7xbv6 Ilse Tromp a first-year starter who had already showcased her corner-scoring prowess against Michigan State the week prior made the game-changing play. Just when it was starting to feel like NU was feeling the loss of its second-year center back Tromp cashed in the go-ahead goal past Mia Magnotta.  It’s already clear that Fuchs’ first-years and sophomores are immensely talented. But for Tromp to step up like this against a national contender when NU was missing one of its best players in a key situation is stellar. It suggests that even when the ‘Cats are at relatively full strength in the postseason the first-years and sophomores can come up with some big moments. Northwestern is as deep a team as any in the nation and as well-rounded as any that Fuchs has coached in recent memory. By the way did I mention that Northwestern is on a 12-game winning streak has beaten six ranked opponents and is on the verge of a No. 1 ranking all without its 2022 First Team All-American who’s training for the Olympics and still has eligibility? Northwestern is the team to beat in the Big Ten... ...and that’s saying a lot. Five of the nation’s top 10 teams come from the conference. Two more are in the top 20. This win propelled NU to 5-0 in Big Ten play and it’s already beaten No. 7 Ohio State and No. 15 Michigan in addition to the Hawkeyes. The Buckeyes were the only team to score against the ‘Cats. The other four opponents? Northwestern outscored them 14-0.  That’s what separates the Wildcats from the only undefeated team in the country: No. 6 Rutgers. In each of their three conference wins the Scarlet Knights won by a single goal and two of those games went to at least double overtime. Granted those came against No. 9 Maryland and No. 16 Penn State but the ‘Cats have also played top competition.  Again Northwestern dominated Iowa. It put up seven more shots on goal and took nine more corners. This was a convincing victory against a top-three team in the nation. Rutgers doesn’t have that on its resume yet which is what made last Friday’s tilt feel like a battle for the national No. 1 spot. After it plays Ohio on Sunday NU ends its regular season with a gauntlet. Fuchs and Co. face the Nittany Lions the Scarlet Knights and the Terps in a span of seven days. That’s undoubtedly tough but Northwestern now controls its own destiny. If it can win all three of those games it can emerge with its first outright Big Ten regular season title since 1994.  Achieving that wouldn’t make or break the season; the 2021 NCAA title team finished fifth and the 2022 national runner-ups came third. But going undefeated in the nation’s best conference — capping off what would be a 16-game two-month win streak at that point — would just about guarantee that the 2023 iteration would be bound for a third straight NCAA Championship appearance. Now that the ‘Cats have handled the best opponent on their regular season with ease on the road it’s not at all ridiculous to call that a real possibility. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Today three teams in the Big Ten will have the privilege of walking away with some very special honors. Numerous teams garnered consideration for these honors but only a select few were able to come out as winners. So without further ado I present to you the winners: The award for “Winner of Big Ten East: Round One” goes to… Ohio State The Buckeyes staked an early claim as the top team in the Big Ten with a 37-17 home victory over Maryland this weekend. The Terrapins raced out to a 10-0 lead and eventually held a 17-10 advantage early in the third quarter but it was all Buckeyes after that. Ohio State finished the game scoring 27 unanswered points thanks in large part to the combination of quarterback Kyle McCord and wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. who connected eight times for 163 yards and a touchdown. The win was not only big for Ohio State but for the entirety of the Big Ten East. Four teams in the division came into the weekend with a perfect record and the winner of this matchup would put the rest of the league on notice. The Buckeyes accomplished that and more despite playing without one of their star players in running back TreVeyon Henderson. While Ohio State travels to West Lafayette to play Purdue next week and Maryland returns home to take on Illinois it isn’t until Oct. 21 that Big Ten East: Round Two takes place when Penn State travels to Columbus to play Ohio State. The award for “Winner of The Little Brown Jug” goes to… Michigan The Wolverines proved why they were the overwhelming favorite when they traveled to Minneapolis and walloped Minnesota 52-10 Saturday night. The night started poorly for the Golden Gophers when Michigan cornerback Will Johnson took an Athan Kaliakmanis pass the opposite way for a 36-yard pick-six to give the Wolverines the early lead. The night ended just as poorly for the Golden Gophers when Kaliakmanis presented Michigan safety Keon Sabb with an early (or late) birthday gift in the form of a 28-yard pick-six to make it 45-10. Minnesota was bad which was expected. On offense they were missing star running back Darius Taylor and without him it was always going to be an uphill battle on that side of the ball. This is especially true since this Michigan defense is ELITE. The offense has gotten a lot of attention this year due to the exceptional play of quarterback J.J. McCarthy running back Blake Corum and wide receiver Roman Wilson but as has been true for the majority of head coach Jim Harbaugh’s tenure in Ann Arbor the defense is what makes this team go. Ask Kaliakmanis... he’ll have nightmares of Jackson Sabb and co. throughout their upcoming bye week. If it’s any comfort to Kaliakmanis Indiana quarterback Tayven Jackson might be in the same boat as he has to face this Wolverine defense next weekend. The award for “Winner of the Charlie Jones Legacy Game” goes to… Iowa In a brand new rivalry game that I may or may not have just created Iowa took down Purdue at home on Saturday in a barn-burner 20-14. Despite playing with a backup quarterback in Deacon Hill who went 6-for-21 passing Iowa won this game behind an opportunistic defense and a sharp rushing attack. Shocker. The Hawkeyes once again proved they belong among the favorites in the Big Ten West alongside Wisconsin. Speaking of Wisconsin these two teams play next weekend in Madison and you can give the Big Ten West title to whoever wins.  The Hawkeyes also proved this weekend that they don’t need a good offense when playing bad teams thanks to their dominant defense. Speaking of bad teams Purdue is bad. Like likely-to-fail-to-make-a-bowl-game-bad. And while Hill struggled for Iowa Purdue quarterback Hudson Card also struggled continuing his up-and-down play this season. That said his offensive line allowing him to be sacked six times probably didn’t help the cause Saturday. Luckily for the Boilermakers they return home for their next game as they look to iron out some of these issues. Unluckily for the Boilermakers they’ll have to do it against aforementioned “potential top team in the Big Ten” Ohio State.

Share this story Too little too late was the story of the week for the Wildcats. Two losses and a draw kept Northwestern at only one Big Ten win with only four regular season games to go. A 0-0 result against Illinois on Sep. 28 was followed by two failed comebacks against Nebraska (3-2) and at Wisconsin (2-1). In a season that started with such high expectations fans are left to wonder where things went wrong. The usually dynamic offense has gone stagnant managing just six goals in six Big Ten games while getting shut-out thrice. The brick wall of a backline has let up eight goals with six of those coming in first halves. It seems as though Northwestern has perpetually been on the back foot not registering a shot in the first half twice. This has forced the ‘Cats to attempt miraculous comebacks really putting their “Cardiac” nickname to the test. It seemed like they would get it done against Nebraska when two Emma Phillips set-piece goals brought the score even at 2-2 in the 84th minute. A ferocious push for a winner left the ‘Cats vulnerable however. One minute after Phillips equalized Nebraska scored on the counter attack breaking Northwestern hearts in the process. Three days later in Madison the Wildcats needed another comeback. After getting out-shot 6-0 and falling behind 2-0 in the first half they roared back. Ella Hase scored her seventh of the season in the 48th minute to make it 2-1. Northwestern kept shooting and a red card by the Wisconsin goalie in the 83rd minute made it feel like the tie was possible. The Badgers knew how to park the bus though and the ‘Cats found nothing before the full-time whistle blew. There have certainly been times where it has felt like Lady Luck has not assumed her seat on the ‘Cats bench. Against Illinois Northwestern managed 18 shots but not one found the back of the net. There have been shots off the post or just wide but a lack of luck cannot necessarily explain away these losses. Northwestern’s next opportunity to right the ship will come in Iowa City on Oct. 12. If the ‘Cats can’t take care of business there they’ll have a much harder time finding a win against their next opponent. Rowan Lapi and No. 4 Penn State will be coming to Evanston on Oct. 15. Northwestern will need to bring their A-game or else what might have been one of the most anticipated matchups of the season could turn ugly. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Exhale.  The first half of the season is in the books as Northwestern approaches a much-needed bye week. At the halfway point the ‘Cats sit at 3-3 (1-2 B1G) and are right in the middle of a crowded Big Ten West field. The bye week allows a chance for rest and relaxation (for both players and fans) but it also affords the team an opportunity for some self-reflection ahead of the remaining conference slate. That internal diagnosis should begin with NU’s most recent game a 23-20 victory against the Howard Bison. In the postgame presser Coach Braun told the media “there’s no such thing as a bad win.” And while I agree with that sentiment Northwestern has a lot to clean up after an FCS team exposed a few blemishes on the ‘Cats’ canvas. Here are five things we learned from Northwestern’s narrow victory over Howard: The team struggles to put together four consecutive quarters of “complementary football” Stop me if you’ve heard this story before. The 2023 Northwestern Wildcats had one incredibly strong half of football and one half of head-scratching gameplay that makes one wonder about the whole operation.  On Saturday the ‘Cats were poised and collected early on cruising to a 16-0 halftime lead as both the offense and defense held up their ends of the bargain. Yet in the second half the momentum warped as Howard outscored the home team 20-7 and made a nail-biter out of a contest that should’ve been put to bed by the end of the third. It’s just more of the same for NU who seemingly has one strong half and one weak half in every contest. In the games against Rutgers UTEP and Minnesota the ‘Cats looked sluggish out of the gate before turning things around in the second half. Against Penn State and Howard the team played inspired in the early frame but eventually ran out of gas. The team has shown spurts of brilliance but until this infuriating in-game inconsistency is remedied it’s hard to imagine many more wins on the schedule. Solid Sullivan I thought Brendan Sullivan performed admirably on Saturday afternoon especially under the circumstances. Ben Bryant’s absence was reportedly a game-time decision thrusting Sullivan into QB1 duties and he did everything Northwestern needed to eke out the win. The stats are unspectacular but Sullivan went 13-of-18 for 131 yards and two touchdowns in the air adding another 38 yards on the ground (which was actually 66 yards if you take out the sack-adjusted yardage a college football stat-keeping quirk that drives me insane). Sullivan kept the ball out of harm’s way picking and choosing his spots and not forcing anything that wasn’t there. Without Bryant or A.J. Henning Mike Bajakian smartly drew up a conservative game plan for Saturday that prioritized clock management and mistake-free football. Even if the total scoring output wasn’t maximized I thought Sullivan ran Bajakian’s offense well given the constraints. Mark Saturday down as another successful adventure for Mike and Sully (the extra time in the bye week is really allowing me to get creative with these — a Monsters Inc. reference in an article has to be an Inside NU first). The offensive line woes continue Oh man does this team miss Peter Skoronski or what? The offensive line play has been a consistent concern for the team through six weeks both in the run and pass game. Saturday provided an opportunity for the group to get some mojo back against an FCS foe. Instead the Bison continued the trend sacking Brendan Sullivan four times on the afternoon. Howard came into Saturday with four sacks on the season across its four games. They doubled that total at Ryan Field. In the run game the ‘Cats were stuffed twice on downs that were two or less yards away from the sticks. With the likes of Iowa and Wisconsin still on the remaining slate these vulnerabilities will only become more obvious and exploitable. Analytics? Not so much There is something to be said about coaching to the flow of the game. “Analytics” too often fail to account for momentum personnel or other confounding variables that make a decision more complicated than “the math nerds say to go for it.”  That said two David Braun decisions stood out as debatable at best to downright dangerous at worst. After scoring a touchdown to go up 22-7 Braun trotted out Jack Olsen to make the extra point to go up 16. A two-point try could have made the game a three-possession contest and had Howard converted its two-point attempt after a touchdown midway through the fourth this decision would have loomed large. Even more curious was the decision to go for it on a fourth-and-three on Howard’s 25 while Northwestern held a 23-7 lead and a field goal would have made it a three-score game. Sullivan was sacked as Northwestern turned the ball over on downs. Braun mentioned postgame that the wind played a factor in the decision but a 42-yard field goal should have been within Olsen’s range gusting winds or not. A.J. Henning’s absence was felt Outside of Sullivan’s touchdown pass to Cam Johnson which was a scramble drill on a long-developing play Northwestern’s offense struggled to test the defense vertically within the structure of Bajakian’s offense. Without speedster A.J. Henning the offense feels far more condensed and predictable. With the Michigan transfer in the lineup the geometry of the defense changes with the threat of his quickness. Without him the bag of trick plays and ways to space the defense is much shallower. Henning was missed in the return game as well. On the afternoon. Northwestern only returned one punt for one yard and other than a nice kickoff return from Anthony Tyus III the ‘Cats totaled just 19 yards on their other three returns combined. Luckily for Northwestern Coach Braun said he expects Henning to return to the lineup after the bye week for Northwestern’s matchup with Nebraska. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Basketball season is now less than a month away which means that it’s time to kick off our preseason content for the men’s and women’s teams. To start off members of our staff ranked each of the games on both teams’ schedules by difficulty with 1 being the toughest matchup. Here’s what the composite looked like for the women’s squad. A table with each individual’s rankings is at the bottom so as not to spoil the fun. Note: Northwestern’s second game of the four-team Ball Dawgs Classic in late November — which will take place against either Stanford or Belmont depending on how the ‘Cats fare against Florida State in the first game — was not included here. 28. vs. Bradley (Average: 27.3) The Braves went 4-28 in 2022-23 so this is pretty self-explanatory. It’s Northwestern’s last game at home before Big Ten play kicks into full gear so this should definitely be a feel-good game. 27. vs. Loyola Chicago (Average: 26.7) Loyola has never made the NCAA Tournament and it has never beaten NU in the nine matchups between these two schools. 26. vs. Southeast Missouri State (Average: 25.8) The Redhawks had a decent year in 2022-23 and return most of their core. They’ll get Northwestern a few days after one of its toughest road tests of the season (more on that later). 25. vs. Omaha (Average: 25.5) Four members of its end-of-season starting five will be back.  24. vs. UIC (Average: 24.5) The Flames faced off against the ‘Cats last December and it was a dogfight. NU pulled out a 66-62 victory on the road. While Northwestern should take a step forward from 2022-23 UIC is still one of the better non-conference opponents on the slate. 23. at Minnesota (Average: 21.8) The easiest Big Ten game comes against the Golden Gophers who went just 4-14 in conference play last year. Northwestern handily beat Minnesota at home by 14 in the teams’ lone matchup last season. The game is on the road and Dawn Plitzuweit’s team is even younger than NU’s but this should definitely be a game the ‘Cats can win. T-21. at Temple vs. Georgetown (Average: 21.5) Both teams struggled in conference play but neither was awful. The game against the Owls which is set for Dec. 21 should be a fun and potentially competitive holiday homecoming for Joe McKeown who’s from Philadelphia. 20. vs. Wisconsin (Average: 20.2) This was Northwestern’s other Big Ten win last year and it was in Madison. The Badgers are going to lose Julie Pospisilova their leading scorer and a two-time All-Big Ten Honorable Mention. Avery LaBarbera won’t be there either. Northwestern has a strong shot to win at home. 19. vs. Penn State (Average: 18.5) Like Minnesota PSU also went 4-14 in conference play in 2022-23. However the Nittany Lions also beat the ‘Cats by 10 in State College. They’ll return star guard Makenna Marisa who averaged 17.5 points per game last season and was named to the Preseason All-Big Ten Team a few weeks ago. Beating Penn State is certainly a possibility especially given that Northwestern’s younger players could take some leaps in production but this game being the 19th-hardest says a lot about how strong the Big Ten is. 18. at Wisconsin (Average: 18.3) 17. at DePaul (Average: 16.8) DePaul came to Evanston last December and beat the ‘Cats by 18. Two of its top three scorers will be back. However the Blue Demons could take a big hit with the loss of two-time All-American Aneesah Morrow who transferred to defending champion LSU. Regardless this is a solid team outside of Morrow and going a few miles down the road could make this game a little tougher. 16. vs. Rutgers (Average: 16.3) If you didn’t watch Kaylene Smikle tear up Northwestern’s defense (and offense!) twice last year you need to go watch her play basketball this winter. The Wildcats still have three more seasons of dealing with the star guard who averaged around 18 points and two steals a game on a 36.9% three-point clip as a first-year. Smikle could very well earn an All-Big Ten First Team nod as soon as this March. 15. at Penn State (Average: 15.2) 14. vs. Purdue (Average: 13.8) Caitlyn Harper and Abbey Ellis are back for their sixth and fifth years respectively. Both played big roles in Purdue’s two wins over NU last year. Turnovers plagued the Wildcats in an 11-point home loss and the Boilermakers lit it up offensively en route to a 15-point win when the two teams played at Mackey Arena. 13. at Rutgers (Average: 12.8) 12. at Nebraska (Average: 12) Had the Huskers not born the brunt of the Big Ten gauntlet — playing Iowa Michigan and Maryland twice — there’s a very real chance they could have gone dancing last year. Star guard and leading scorer Jaz Shelley is using her fifth year of eligibility. With her and Alexis Markowski —  both of whom were named to the Preseason All-Big Ten Team — in the fold Nebraska could be in a really good spot. Going to Lincoln will certainly be a tough task. 11. at Michigan State (Average: 11.5) MSU controlled the game throughout its win in Evanston last year. It will lose a decent number of seniors but this was one of the best offenses in the nation last year; the Spartans averaged 78.2 points a contest. East Lansing is also one of the tougher places to play. 10. vs. Illinois (Average: 10.3) Northwestern actually played the Illini close in both games last year almost pulling off a massive comeback in Champaign. But Illinois’ entire starting lineup is returning and this is a team that finished fifth in the Big Ten. Makira Cook is a name to watch; after leading the way with 18.3 points and 1.2 steals per game last year she could be a sleeper All-American pick if her team can somehow jump into the top echelon of the conference with Iowa and Indiana. 9. vs. Michigan (Average: 9.2) Laila Phelia is back and was named as a unanimous All-Big Ten Preseason honoree by the coaches. She should be terrific. The Wolverines are losing a decent amount of talent (particularly WNBA-bound Leigha Brown) which gives NU a sneaky-decent chance to pull off an upset at Welsh-Ryan Arena as it did in 2021-22. Regardless this is still a team that finished as the No. 18 squad in the country and probably could have advanced farther than the Round of 32 had it not run into LSU. It still has an elite player leading the way. This is a very good team. 8. at Illinois (Average: 8) 7. vs. Florida State in Las Vegas (Average: 6.8) FSU’s top three scorers are returning. Its best player was a first-year Ta’Niya Latson who enjoyed one of the greatest freshman seasons in the history of women’s college basketball. Latson averaged 21.5 points per game was an All-ACC First Teamer and was named the National Freshman of the Year by most major outlets.  She’ll also have forward Mikayla Timpson who averaged an eye-popping 2.1 blocks and 1.1 steals a contest to form one of the nation’s most dynamic duos. The Athletic named the ‘Noles as its No. 16-ranked team. Assuming Latson improves even more Florida State is an ACC title contender. Plus with an opportunity to play Stanford potentially on the line in a tournament setting there’s almost no chance Northwestern will be a trap game for FSU. 6. vs. Ohio State (Average: 6) It’s pretty insane to think that Northwestern’s schedule isn’t as difficult as it could be but that’s not a ridiculous statement to make because it will only face off against four of the top five opponents on this list once. The Big Ten is just so talented at the top and OSU is no exception. The Buckeyes put up points like nobody’s business and their press overwhelmed Northwestern in their two 30-point wins over McKeown and Co.  ""Ohio State had a whopping six (!!) scorers who averaged double figures in 2022-23 and five of them are coming back. Cotie McMahon should spearhead that offensive output. Like the next five teams OSU could make a serious run at the Final Four. An upset over the Buckeyes on Jan. 5 which will be Northwesterns first home Big Ten game with students back on campus after break would be a season-defining victory."" 5. at Maryland (Average: 5.2) ""The Terps might be a little worse than Ohio State but theyre still an elite team. Plus Northwestern has gone 1-13 against Maryland and the XFINITY Center has been a house of horrors. Not only has NU never won in College Park its only lost by fewer than 10 points on the road just once. There are different players on both sides obviously but it would be remarkable if the Cats managed to beat a team that advanced to the Elite Eight and hasnt lost at home since Dec. 4 2022."" 4. vs. Indiana (Average: 3.7) More on the Hoosiers later... 3. at Notre Dame (Average: 3.5) ""I mean... its Notre Dame in South Bend. Sonia Citron and Olivia Miles are both back and both could make All-American teams. Miles already has. The Irish have improved each year since head coach Niele Ivey took over for Muffet McGraw in 2020 and that shouldnt change this season. If that wasnt discouraging enough Ivey is also bringing in three of the 24 players in the Class of 2023 that ESPN rated as five-star recruits. Hannah Hidalgo (No. 5) Cassandre Prosper (No. 16) and Emma Risch (No. 20) should add to an already loaded core."" ""ND crushed Northwestern at Welsh-Ryan in a 34-point blowout last November so hopefully its not that rough this time around."" 2. vs. Iowa (Average: 1.8) Please do yourself a favor and go watch one of the greatest players in the history of college basketball put on a show at Welsh-Ryan on Jan. 31.  1. at Indiana (Average: 1.3) ""Unanimous All-American Mackenzie Holmes is back as is virtually her entire supporting cast sans Grace Berger. Theres no reason to think that the Hoosiers cant replicate their incredible 2022-23 season in which they peaked at No. 2 and went 16-2 in Big Ten play. They lost a grand total of one game in Bloomington which happened to come at the worst possible time against Miami in the Round of 32 to prematurely end their season. Indiana routinely draws incredible crowds and last years success should make Assembly Hall the toughest environment Northwestern will face this upcoming season.""

Share this story It’s moved by fairly quickly but we’ve officially reached the halfway point of Northwestern football’s 2023 campaign. Although just six games in it’s safe to say the season has been nothing short of a rollercoaster. At three wins and three losses the Wildcats can still see themselves contending for a top spot in the Big Ten West division and maybe then a spot in the Big Ten Championship. NU (3-3 1-2 B1G) trails just Wisconsin (4-1 2-0) and Iowa (5-1 2-1) in the West division. But to have a real shot at reaching Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis for the third time in six years there is plenty of work to be done.  Ben Bryant deserves to be QB1 It’s obvious that Northwestern’s offense isn’t unstoppable but amid the offensive struggles the spotlight has been placed on quarterback Ben Bryant the sixth-year transfer from Cincinnati. Although the offense has struggled the run game and offensive line protection pose bigger issues than the passing game. Northwestern’s backfield production is one of the worst in the Big Ten this season.  According to the Big Ten Network the ‘Cats are averaging 103 yards per game (14th in the conference) and 3.1 yards per attempt (14th) despite having 198 rushing attempts this year (7th) — good for nearly 49% of their total offensive plays this season. Meanwhile Bryant hasn’t been exceptional but he’s been solid. Bryant is ninth in the Big Ten in passing yards eight in passing touchdowns and seventh in completions. He may not be NU’s saving grace but he should continue to get opportunities to prove himself as a starter. “Interim Head Coach” David Braun is here to stay After a treacherous period for Northwestern football this summer where 17-year head coach Pat Fitzgerald was fired amid the team’s hazing scandal it looked like Northwestern might actually do worse than their 1-11 record in 2022. Nothing was expected of newly promoted head coach David Braun; in fact practically every major sports news outlet including Fox Sports Athlon Sports CBS Sports 247 Sports and Bleacher Report predicted  Northwestern would finish at the bottom of its division. Few predicted the ‘Cats would even amass three wins. But after a strong start his stay looks more than just temporary. The squad needed a culture change and it seems like Braun’s given them one.  The Wildcats are nowhere near perfect talent-wise but they definitely seem to be playing with heart under Braun evidenced by their dominance over UTEP impressive comeback versus Minnesota and the hard-fought game against a top-ten team in Penn State.  Bryce Kirtz is the X-Factor The storyline for senior Bryce Kirtz is similar to the team’s: little was expected but expectations have been thoroughly exceeded thus far. The wide receiver who is in his fourth season at NU hadn’t reached 20 catches or more than 212 yards in any of his first three seasons. With a crowded receiving room around him – including talented receivers like senior Cam Johnson Michigan transfer AJ Henning and tight end Charlie Mangieri – a breakout season was unlikely. Nonetheless Kirtz has been magnificent. He’s already broken his season-high in receptions (24) and he’s currently in the top five in the entire conference in receiving yards per game (65.4) and top 10 in total receiving yards (327) among all ball-catchers. At this pace Kirtz could be Northwestern’s most valuable player by the season’s end. Takeaways win games While this phrase seems fairly obvious in football it has proven extremely important to Northwestern’s games so far. In games where the Wildcat offense does not turn the ball over they are 3-0; in the games that they have 0-3. Even further forcing turnovers has been of the utmost importance because the winner of the turnover battle has also been the winner of every Northwestern game this season save for the overtime victory against Minnesota. Keeping care of the ball on offense and playing aggressively on defense seems like it will be the difference in whether or not NU plays a bowl game. The season isn’t over! Of course being 6-0 is a little nicer than being 3-3. But one of the biggest perks of having a .500 record is having a brand-new slate. Northwestern finds itself in a great position all things considered. Earning its way into a bowl game or even the Big Ten West is not out of the realm of possibility – two things deemed all but impossible at the beginning of the season. The Wildcats face a difficult second-half slate with tough matchups against formidable opponents like Maryland Iowa and Wisconsin. Northwestern might have to pull some magic to achieve the bowl status it desires but anything can happen.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story We’ve got some new NU alumni in the fold! Week Five saw many of our regular contributors take a rest on their bye but other former ‘Cats stepped up in unexpected places. Let’s take a look at what they achieved in the NFL this weekend.  Peter Skoronski: Tennessee Titans OG Skoronski’s return to Tennessee’s O-Line after a three-week absence was much welcomed by his teammates. The rookie guard picked up where he left off in the season opener protecting Ryan Tannehill without a penalty or sack allowed in the Titans’ 23-16 loss to the Colts. Skoronski had a difficult matchup in All-Pro defensive tackle DeForest Buckner but he held his own.  If Skoronski is able to stay healthy for the rest of the season he should be a strong contender for All-Rookie honors. His presence immediately bolsters Tennessee’s entire line in both the pass and run. Skoronski and the Titans will look to rebound against the Ravens in London.  Week Six matchup: vs. Baltimore Ravens (Sunday 8:30 a.m. CT) Dean Lowry: Minnesota Vikings DE Lowry’s one contribution in the Vikings’ 27-20 loss came in the third quarter when he helped bring down Isiah Pacheco to force a Chiefs’ fourth down. His stop didn’t end up mattering; Harrison Smith was called for pass interference gifting Kansas City a first-and-10 on a drive that ended in a touchdown. It’s the same story for Lowry and the 1-4 Vikings week in and week out. They shoot themselves in the foot with porous defense and undisciplined offense which has led to a league-worst turnover differential of minus nine. If Minnesota can’t right the ship against the Bears they might think about becoming sellers at the Oct. 31 trade deadline. Week Six matchup: at Chicago Bears (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Ben Skowronek: Los Angeles Rams WR Skowronek saw just one target in the Rams’ 23-14 loss to the Eagles. He was buried even further down Los Angeles’ depth chart with the return of star receiver Cooper Kupp. Nonetheless Skowronek was able to contribute on special teams recording a solo tackle.  The third-year receiver’s offensive playing time will likely remain paltry. Skowronek will stay ready in the event of an injury to a Rams receiver and continue to put in work on special times. Los Angeles faces the 1-4 Cardinals at home on Sunday afternoon. Week Six matchup: vs. Arizona Cardinals (Sunday 3:25 p.m. CT) Adetomiwa Adebawore: Indianapolis Colts DE A new addition to this week’s column Adebawore was active for the second straight week. The fourth-round rookie didn’t see any defensive action in the Colts’ 23-16 win but he came in for six snaps on special teams. Perhaps Adebawore will get a chance in Indianapolis’ pass rush rotation in the near future. Adebawore starred for NU’s defense last season putting up five sacks and nine tackles for loss. His output earned him a third team All-Big Ten selection and Indianapolis took a chance on his upside with the 110th selection in April. Adebawore only improved in his four years in the purple-and-white and he will look to do the same as his first NFL season progresses. Week Six matchup: at Jacksonville Jaguars (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Earnest Brown IV: Los Angeles Rams DE Brown IV was active for the first time since the Rams’ season opener on Sept. 10. Los Angeles fell to Philadelphia in a 23-14 loss but Brown managed to contribute in his eight defensive snaps. His PFF grade of 81.3 was the second-highest out of all Rams defenders as he helped stuff the run.  The Rams lost starting defensive lineman Bobby Brown III to a Grade 3 MCL sprain on Sunday which could lead to more snaps for Brown IV. Drafted in the fifth round in 2021 Brown never put up gaudy sack numbers for NU but he notched 8.5 tackles for loss as a senior. He will look to capitalize on a potentially expanded role against the Cardinals and get after quarterback Joshua Dobbs. Week Six matchup: vs. Arizona Cardinals (Sunday 3:25 p.m. CT) Blake Hance: Jacksonville Jaguars OG Hance saw some more offensive action in the Jaguars’ impressive 25-20 against the Bills. The undrafted lineman briefly filled in for left tackle Cam Robinson who missed three snaps with an elbow injury. During that time Hance helped clear a path for running back Travis Etienne as he galloped into the end zone to seal a Jacksonville win with three minutes remaining. Hance has been an unexpected contributor in spot situations for the Jaguars. He’ll look to keep that momentum going at home against the Colts. Week Six matchup: vs. Indianapolis Colts (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) ‘Cats that didn’t play this week (or record any stats): Rashawn Slater (Los Angeles Chargers bye week) Greg Newsome II/Anthony Walker Jr./Cameron Mitchell (Cleveland Browns bye week) Evan Hull (Indianapolis Colts torn meniscus) Tyler Lancaster (Denver Broncos practice squad) Ifeadi Odenigbo (New York Jets injured reserve) Godwin Igwebuike (Pittsburgh Steelers) Joe Gaziano (Atlanta Falcons) Trevor Siemian (New York Jets practice squad)  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story It’s okay to be excited. Really. The expectation for this season was not to be on top of the conference so before we get into the fact that yes the fourth quarter came a little too close to a disappointing loss enjoy having an even record. Enjoy that it was worth watching through the fourth quarter. Enjoy that the past few weeks have had positive takeaways: being able to hang with Penn State for a half being able to launch a second-half comeback against Minnesota being able to actually win. Most importantly enjoy the fact that this is a bye week and a recharge is what the Wildcats need.  Northwestern was the favorite headed into the game and that seemed apparent as Brendan Sullivan led the ‘Cats to a touchdown on the opening drive. For the most part Northwestern didn’t have trouble putting up points but at the same time the second half was vastly different than the first.  It was 16-0 NU through the first two quarters but Howard went on a 20-7 run in the final two periods. The ‘Cats struggled to keep up their momentum and play with dominance in each quarter. A game that seemed like it would be a blowout came a little too close to being blown up by a last-minute surge from the Bison.  Granted it was Sullivan filling in for an injured Ben Bryant. Granted the offensive line has been holding the Wildcats back — Sullivan was sacked three times.  But even so a football team that had no expectations at the start of the season deserves a little bit more than scrutiny at this point. Northwestern football is far from perfect but it’s not as if the ‘Cats aren’t contending. At .500 and third in the Big Ten West why not rally around a win? Why not get excited to watch some key members of the offense? Why not take this bye week with grace? On Saturday Cam Johnson and Bryce Kirtz picked up 55 and 41 yards through the air respectively. Kirtz is a player who lacked touches in his first three seasons in Evanston and now he’s amassed 327 yards a career-high. Maybe the ‘Cats are still waiting for an explosive performance from Cam Porter but he was the go-to for Sullivan against Howard in the first half with 12 carries for 58 yards. He’s solid and he deserves support.  In the big picture it’s worth being excited for this second half of the season. That’s a rare occurrence for Northwestern football. Given that this bye week allows Bryant and A.J. Henning some time to get healthy and hopefully return for a slate of Big Ten matchups Braun and Co. have to feel good about what lies ahead. And what lies ahead could spell a .500 record for the next half of the season.  Iowa Wisconsin and Maryland will be difficult — no question there. But against Nebraska Purdue and Illinois — wins are attainable. Both the Huskers and the ‘Cats have the same exact record but Nebraska didn’t beat Minnesota.  Who knows how the rest of the season will go but for a team that had virtually zero expectations it’s difficult to be disappointed by what the ‘Cats have done so far.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Olsen @InvrrtedFB  Oct 11, 2023, 11:54am CDT      / new",Men’s soccer: No. 12 Northwestern stretches unbeaten start to 12 games, If the ‘Cats held on to that 2-0 lead at Wisconsin they’d have 12 (instead of 10) points in the Big Ten and this number gimmick would have a third dimension but alas. Share this story The introductions — and headlines for that matter — for these updates have become rather formulaic.  I include the ‘Cats’ current spot in the United Soccer Coaches (USC) Top 25 (still No. 12) and how many games they’ve played without a loss (now 12) before spending a couple hundred words exploring the “validity” of those figures. So guess what I’m going to do this week?  Yep you guessed it (or maybe you didn’t): the same exact thing. For the first time this season and probably in my three years of covering this team as well I looked at the NCAA RPI rankings. You can only imagine what went through my head when I saw No. 42 next to Northwestern one of just seven outfits in the country to have maintained a zero in the loss column. Even as someone who has been quick to criticize this team and put many of its achievements this year down to luck 42nd still feels low. It feels even lower considering the ‘Cats extinguished the flames of UIC ranked 34th by a margin of four goals to one. On the other hand without knowing what goes into the RPI formula it’s hard to comment on its output. However there is also a reason RPI was replaced with NET for determining the tournament field in men’s basketball but a more pertinent observation would be this: It’s just difficult to get a good read on where NU is truly at. Maybe a showdown with Michigan State No. 18 in RPI and No. 19 in the USC Top 25 next week will prove to be enlightening on that front. Northwestern 0 Green Bay 0 Tuesday Oct. 3 (Evanston Ill.) Well this was an interesting game. In what was Northwestern’s most dominant performance of the season in my opinion it failed to come away with all three points which makes perfect sense given how things have gone this season. As has been the case all year and throughout Payne’s tenure everything starts with the press and it was once again effective (4-2-3-1/4-1-4-1 vs. Green Bay 4-2-4 IP).  However it wasn’t perfect. There was a disconnect between how the back line responded to jumps from the wingers particularly Justin Weiss on the left. Especially when both sides were shifted toward NU’s right touchline Weiss was engaging the Phoenix RCB upon reception. Problem is if the RB could be found he had acres of space to work with and could manipulate the chaos created by the Wildcat block having to shift across the pitch. The below clip illustrates this well with Green Bay not taking full advantage. pic.twitter.com/qTqzuitVUw I mentioned a disconnect and that’s Fritz Volmar at LB not jumping to the Phoenix RB as soon as the RCB receives. Volmar is initially pinned deep as the back line is man-to-man (4v4) with Green Bay’s forwards meaning he can’t vacate that area without leaving a spare man that is also easily accessible. However if as he goes forward his fellow defenders shift across to leave the LW free it would take a remarkable cross-field pass for that numerical superiority to be punished. Now for once the quality of Northwestern’s IP play (3-2-5 vs. Green Bay 4-2-3-1 block) matched its OOP play. While the inclination to go after every transition was still apparent there was far less verticality from settled play. The ‘Cats seemed to be looking for optimal circumstances to “exit” deeper phases and move up the pitch as opposed to the usual mentality of playing forward whenever it’s an option even if it’s not a good one. Take this sequence for example. NU’s 3+2 strings 10 passes together to draw Green Bay’s midfield forward. Once that happens a sharp around-the-corner pass from Collin McCamy to a dropping Volmar exploiting the 2v1 with the latter and Weiss against the defending FB ignites a faux transition for Northwestern with favorable conditions both numerically and dynamically. pic.twitter.com/FuUonScb3t That WCB —> ball-side DM —> width-holder pattern wasn’t limited to the left side with Bryant Mayer Rom Brown and Brandon Clagette getting involved down the right minutes later. Although in this instance the second pass was a ball for Clagette to run onto and not to feet like Volmar received. pic.twitter.com/wJHC54hKR7 This next clip might be my favorite of not just the night but of the season. I have never seen this team produce such pure soccer. First there’s the methodical buildup leading to incremental progression. Nigel Prince — who has been the ever-present anchor of the Northwestern defense this year — carrying forward at 0:20 and his subsequent torso deception to create a lane to a lateral movement from Brown is just exactly what you want to see. Then there’s the brilliant last-line abandonments from first Ugo Achara Jr. and then Weiss after NU enters the attacking half the second of which leads to multiple crossing opportunities from the left. pic.twitter.com/0HiVzsDbbc Unfortunately the at times brilliant adverts for possession soccer would be overshadowed by two inconvenient matters. Northwestern failing to hit the back of the net was the first and the second was well what’s about to follow. Somehow the VAR “incident” regarding a Luis Díaz goal for Liverpool against Tottenham might not have been the biggest gaffe I’ve seen involving this sport and a video review in the past few weeks. To start here’s the on-field situation we’re concerned with. It’s the 79th minute the score is still deadlocked at 0-0 and Weiss gets brought down near the edge of the 18-yard box after playing a nice one-two with Achara Jr.  pic.twitter.com/giuA6tgg2y The referee calls a foul but by rule can then go to the monitor to check whether it was inside the box so to presumably be safe gives a free kick. The replay in the above clip shows the foul occurred in the box and after the game Payne said their overhead camera also makes that extremely clear. Unfortunately the replay monitor shut down right at the moment the referee went over to look and would not turn back on. Since the rules dictate referees can only look at the broadcast feed he couldn’t use the angle the NU bench had and was forced to stick with his call on the field. As frustrating as this sequence events was putting the result all on this moment would be disingenuous. First of all had the penalty been given someone still would’ve had to step up and slot it away and secondly the ‘Cats had quite a few other missed opportunities. Northwestern 2 (Achara Jr. 79’ Van Deventer 87’) Rutgers 0 Sunday Oct. 8 (Evanston Ill.) Although it posed much more of a challenge to Northwestern than Green Bay Rutgers left Martin Stadium with a worse result. The main reason behind this was its defensive structure. The base shape was a 4-1-4-1 but against NU’s 3-2-5 with Volmar going forward from LB the RW would drop while the LW moved into a LST-like position. This  5-1-2-2 featuring tight man-marking on the double pivot of McCamy and Brown unsettled the ‘Cats a bit when they had the ball — although they still had solutions to this press. Jackson Weyman getting involved and making passes was one of these strategies. After an attempted Rutgers press which Prince was able to escape the GK has time to find Ibrahim Obeid in space with a clipped ball. The RB was then able to drive forward exploiting the lack of wide coverage in the Rutgers midfield but his eventual cross let him down. pic.twitter.com/xlmopU5nab There were also moments where Northwestern could’ve done more. Reese Mayer at LCB is forced to carry forward down the left flank here and ultimately hits a ball over the top which on its face might not appear to be terrible. pic.twitter.com/3LkkoKnDh9 If you pause the above clip at 0:18 which is right before Mayer sends the ball forward you should see the issue. Jason Gajadhar is running forward anticipating that type of pass instead of dropping into the massive gap formed by NU’s double pivot splitting and pulling its markers apart. If the sophomore midfielder receives in that area there’s ample opportunity to circulate play to the right and take advantage of the space on that side. To be clear this isn’t any individual player’s fault. This is the result of trained and reinforced behaviors in practices and the movements and passes that are encouraged in those settings are what will you’ll see during games. Expecting anything to the contrary is just insanity so I’m being critical of how the players are being trained not the players themselves. Lastly when the Scarlet Knight RW who usually dropped off jumped to Mayer it created a 3v2 in NU’s favor and that McCamy one-touch pass allowed the ‘Cats to access an unmarked Volmar. What follows in this clip is much less pleasing. pic.twitter.com/gNg0hPitAt In the first half Rutgers might’ve just edged the affair but in the second it was all Northwestern. The New Jersey-based side held on for as long as it could but after getting a man sent off in the 76th minute its resistance to increasing Wildcat pressure crumbled. It took just over two minutes for the ‘Cats to breach the 10-man Scarlet Knight defense. The lead-up to the opener wasn’t anything fancy but it’s a nice turn and carry from Jayvin Van Deventer to create the opportunity and Weiss’ does well in the box to find Achara Jr. for a tap-in. pic.twitter.com/FnCn5gOl1w Despite being a man up for the five minutes following the opener you would be forgiven for thinking the team with the numerical advantage was Rutgers. The ‘Cats immediately dropped off ceding territory and possession to protect the lead which Payne was less than content with on the touchline. Ultimately that reaction to having a one-goal lead with 10 minutes to go while suboptimal proved to be inconsequential. I’ll just end off by leaving the video of in Payne’s words “one of the most if not the most skilled players in the team” to explain why. Jayvin Van Deventer.

Share this story 1. Michigan (6-0 3-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 1 Last Result: 52-10 win at Minnesota Next: vs. Indiana Another week another Wolverines blowout. J.J. McCarthy and company dismantled a Minnesota team that had come into the week near the top of the Big Ten West standings featuring two rushing touchdowns from their quarterback as well as another connection from McCarthy to receiver Colston Loveland. The Big Ten’s most unstoppable force will return home and face perhaps the conference’s most moveable object in the Indiana Hoosiers next weekend which should provide even more opportunities for Michigan’s defense to strut its stuff. 2. Penn State (5-0 3-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 3 Last Result: 41-13 win at Northwestern Next: vs. UMass Penn State got the week off allowing it to bask in the glory of its 28-point win over Northwestern on the road and prepare for a non-conference matchup against the UMass Minutemen. Despite playing one less game than most teams in the Big Ten Penn State’s versatile offense still ranks 3rd in total points (1st in points per game) as well as the having the third most rushing attempts — the latter a testament to the strength of Nick Singleton Kaytron Allen and even Trey Potts. 3. Ohio State (5-0 2-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 2 Last Result: 37-17 win vs. Maryland Next: at Purdue After a lackadaisical first half against Maryland the Buckeyes went back into the locker room during the break and something clicked. The offense snapped off for three touchdowns two originating out of the right arm of Kyle McCord and one ran in by Chip Trayanum. A game that Maryland once led 10-0 finished as a 20-point Ohio State blowout further cementing Ohio State’s passing game as one of the best and most efficient in the conference. 4. Maryland (5-1 2-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 4 Last Result: 37-17 loss at Ohio State Next: vs. Illinois For a little bit it looked like the Terps might shove Ohio State to the side and force the press to rank them alongside their undefeated peers. Instead Maryland was handed its first loss of the season after scoring just seven points in the second half. Nevertheless Maryland is still in the midst of one of its strongest seasons in recent memory thanks to not only quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa’s efforts but also a defensive unit that is one of the Big Ten’s very best at defending the pass. 5. Iowa (5-1 2-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 5 Last Result: 20-14 win vs. Purdue Next: at Wisconsin The Iowa Hawkeyes might not have had a receiver catch a pass all day nor did offensive coordinator Brian Ferentz hop back on pace for his contractual points obligation but they still managed to find a way to win. Granted Iowa was playing a 2-3 Purdue team that has been one of the conference’s worst at defending the run but running backs Kaleb Johnson and Leshon Williams showed out racking up 134 and 74 yards respectively and taking 30 carries between them. The Hawketes has options which they’ll need to exploit playing a much tougher team in Wisconsin next week. 6. Wisconsin (4-1 2-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 6 Last Result: 24-13 win vs. Rutgers Next: vs. Iowa The Badgers cooled off a scalding hot Rutgers team this last week with a decisive victory that was diminished a bit by garbage-time points and they got contributions from everywhere in the process. Quarterback Tanner Mordecai didn’t play his best game but he was picked up as always by star running back Kaytron Allen as well as a key pick-six by Ricardo Hallman on the defensive end. Wisconsin will have to clean things up a bit when playing a tougher team next week but the pieces are there. 7. Nebraska (3-3 1-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 8 Last Result: 20-7 win at Illinois Next: vs. Northwestern After a horrid first couple of games the Cornhuskers have turned things around with a combination of strong play and weak competition the latter epitomized by their two-score win over a flailing Illinois team last week. Head coach Matt Rhule has helped to cultivate a ground game that racks up more yards per contest than every team in the conference besides Wisconsin. It was put on display in Champaign with two touchdown runs from two different backs which were the deciding factor the game. The ‘Huskers face a team that’s a bit closer to their level in Northwestern in two weeks; another chance to showcase their new identity. 8. Rutgers (4-2 1-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 7 Last Result: 24-13 loss at Wisconsin Next: vs. Michigan State Rutgers picked up its second loss of the season at the hands of a surging Wisconsin team on the road looking more like the team many expected them to be than the team we’ve seen over the first five weeks of the season. The cracks in the Scarlet Knights’ offense showed through while facing a better run defense than their non-conference opponents but a 14-point second quarter allowed by their defense ultimately set them back in last week’s matchup. They’ll have an opportune chance to reset against a scuffling Michigan State team next time out. 9. Minnesota (3-3 1-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 9 Last Result: 52-10 loss vs. Michigan Next: at Iowa Losing by over 40 points to Michigan at home probably halted any momentum they had left but aside from a Week 11 matchup in Columbus the Golden Gophers are out of the woods on really tough opponents. Even so this week’s loss has bumped them down to 11th on the Big Ten points allowed per game leaderboard accentuated by a passing defense that ranks third-worst in the conference with 235.3 yards allowed per game in the air. 10. Northwestern (3-3 1-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 10 Last Result: 23-20 win vs. Howard Next: at Nebraska The ‘Cats’ game against Howard was closer than it should have been but nevertheless Northwestern is entering the halfway point in the college football season with a .500 record. Sure its -32 point differential suggests NU as more of a 2-4 team but it’s alright to applaud the effort this squad has put forth so far. Still there’s reason to believe that a decline is coming. Only one of the ‘Cats’ three wins has been against a conference opponent and they rank in the bottom three of the conference in points allowed per game rushing yards per game and rushing yards allowed per game. They do force opponents to run the ball more thanks to an above average pass defense but that might change as they encounter some tougher Big Ten opponents. 11. Purdue (2-4 1-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 11 Last Result: 20-14 loss at Iowa Next: vs. Ohio State Last week’s matchup against Iowa was one that the Boilermakers should have won especially considering that they limited Iowa quarterback Deacon Hill to just 110 passing yards on a 6-for-21 clip. Ultimately Purdue was held to just two scores by a middling Iowa defensive unit as the Boilermakers’ usually solid passing game behind quarterback Hudson Card was not enough to push them across the finish line with the victory in hand. Not the result they were looking for as they prepare to host Ohio State next week. 12. Michigan State (2-3 0-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 13 Last Result: 26-16 loss at Iowa Next: at Rutgers Michigan State had the luxury of a bye week to rebound from a 10-point loss in Iowa City and the Spartans were able to watch as some of the teams around them in this ranking got worse. Sure Michigan State’s offense ranks average to below average in most categories but it at least managed to get the ball far enough down the field to chip away at an Iowa defense that has confounded the likes of Purdue and would probably terrorize Illinois. The Spartans haven’t gotten better but the field around them is teetering. 13. Illinois (2-4 0-3 B1G) Last Ranking: 12 Last Result: 20-7 loss vs. Nebraska Next: at Maryland This season has quickly turned into a disaster for the Fighting Illini who managed just one passing touchdown against one of the Big Ten’s worst pass defenses. To his credit quarterback Luke Altmyer managed 29 completions for 289 yards but couldn’t get things done in the red zone. Running the ball became an issue for Illinois. Nebraska boasts the best run defense in the conference aside from Penn State and the Illini couldn’t come up with other options for short gains. Maybe they’ll fare better against a more middle-of-the-pack run defense in Maryland next week. 14. Indiana (2-3 0-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 14 Last Result: 44-17 loss at Maryland Next: at Michigan A 2-3 overall record usually isn’t basement material in the Big Ten but Indiana has gotten slaughtered by both of its conference opponents mustering only three points against Ohio State in Week One and getting blown out in College Park heading into its bye week. Despite a solid secondary and the offense’s ability to air out the football the Hoosiers have put their ineptitude on display when it comes to running the football and defending against the run. It’s hurt them even when playing against less run-heavy teams because opponents know they can exploit this area of Indiana’s game. An upcoming contest in the Big House might bring out the worst of these shortcomings. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Northwestern men’s basketball starts its quest for consecutive March Madness appearances in only 26 days. With Big Ten Basketball Media Days concluding yesterday from Minneapolis the anticipation is palpable. In advance of NU’s season opener against Binghamton on Nov. 6 our staffers ranked all of the Wildcats’ 30 matchups in terms of winnability from 30 (the easiest) to 1 (most difficult). Take a look at the cumulative results and feel free to chime in below! Note: The ‘Cats’ matchup against either Mississippi State or Washington State in the Basketball Hall of Fame Tip-off Tournament was excluded because the opponent is not yet known. No. 30: vs. Binghamton (Average: 29.63) Northwestern’s first official game back in Welsh-Ryan Arena should be a get-right one. The Bearcats of the America East Conference went 13-18 a season ago and lost their top scorer in Jacob Falko. No. 29: vs. Western Michigan (28.75) The Broncos finished just 8-23 last year earning a spot of No. 323 in KenPom rankings. The Wildcats should hold a significant edge over WMU. No. 28: vs. Jackson State (28.38) Northwestern’s only game on Peacock may not be a close affair. In 2022-23 the Tigers went 14-19 finishing No. 304 in KenPom. No. 27: vs. Chicago State (26.88) The Wildcats started their 2022-23 campaign with an 85-54 drubbing over an intriguing Chicago State team. Northwestern should be able to get the best of the Cougars yet again this year. No. 26: vs. Northern Illinois (25.38) The Huskies are another team that Northwestern handled in early November of last year. NIU is looking to improve its 13-19 record from last year. No. 25: vs. Detroit Mercy (25.25) The Titans concluded 2022-23 at 14-19 but actually netted a top-200 slot in KenPom. However Detroit Mercy departs its top two scorers from last year in Antoine Davis and Gerald Liddell so some adjusting may be in store. No. 24: vs. Minnesota (23.63) A conference matchup this early may seem premature but NU has won its last two games against the Gophers. On top of that UMN loses impressive forward Jamison Battle — not a ton of promise exists up north right now on the heels of a last-place finish in the Big Ten. No. 23: vs. Rhode Island (23.50) Northwestern’s first neutral-site game comes against the Rams in Uncasville Connecticut. Rhode Island is hoping for a much better campaign following a 9-22 finish which put the team second-to-last in the Atlantic 10. No. 22: at DePaul (21.63) NU defended its home city against the Blue Demons last year. This time around they’ll make the short trek downtown to Wintrust Arena to battle with Tony Stubblefield’s squad which is seeking its first winning season since 2018-19. No. 21: at Minnesota (21.13) Playing the Gophers in Minneapolis will definitely prove tougher for the ‘Cats who haven’t won in Minnesota since 2021. No. 20: vs. Nebraska (20.38) The Wildcats have won seven straight against their Big Ten West rivals. Last year in Lincoln Ty Berry exploded for 26 points on six threes; which ‘Cat may feast against the Huskers this year? No. 19: vs. Penn State (17.88) Penn State proved a painstaking opponent for Northwestern last year beating NU twice — including in overtime of the Big Ten Tournament. With no Micah Shrewsberry Jalen Pickett Seth Lundy and a roster overhaul though Happy Valley may prove a land of transition this year. No. 18: at Nebraska (17) Northwestern has claimed its last two games in Pinnacle Bank Arena so Chris Collins & Co. may feel right at home out in Lincoln. No. 17: vs. Dayton (16.75) This one has been circled for quite a while. Northwestern’s second game of the year should prove a worthwhile test against the Flyers who went 22-12 last year — good for 79th in KenPom. Junior forward and First Team All-A10 selection DaRon Holmes II will have to be atop the pecking order for NU’s defense. No. 16: vs. Michigan (15.88) UM went 2-0 against the ‘Cats last year but will be sans Hunter Dickinson Jett Howard and Kobe Bufkin. The Wolverines were projected to finish 11th in the Big Ten per the conference’s preseason poll. No. 15: at Penn State (14.63) This will mark Northwestern’s first game in the Bryce Jordan Center since 2021. NU hasn’t won in State College since Dec. 2016. No. 14: vs. Arizona State (14.25) Don’t sleep on this matchup between the Wildcats and Sun Devils out in Phoenix. Both teams ended 2022-23 ranked in the top 55 of KenPom and having made the Second Round of the NCAA Tournament. No. 13: vs. Ohio State (13.75) Uncertainty surrounded Chris Holtmann’s job status subsequent to a 16-19 campaign but OSU got hot in March reaching the final round of the Big Ten Tournament. The Buckeyes having added Battle from Minnesota look to rebound. No. 12: vs. Iowa (13.5) Northwestern pulled off one of its more memorable performances in the new Welsh-Ryan Arena when it dismantled Iowa 80-60. The Hawkeyes depart Kris Murray Filip Rebraca and Connor McCaffery but should still be competitive. No. 11: vs. Illinois (10.13) Northwestern defeated the Illini at home for the first time last year since Jan. 2019. The bigger question may be if the ‘Cats don their “Chicago’s Own” jerseys yet again for good luck. No. 10: vs. Maryland (9.5) The Terrapins are shaping up to be one of the more formidable teams in the Big Ten. Both Jahmir Young and Julian Reese were projected First Team All-Big Ten nominees. No. 9: at Wisconsin (9) Northwestern escaped with a low-scoring win against the Badgers in Madison last year. UW  No. 8: at Rutgers (8.88) The Wildcats’ last game of the 2022-23 regular season was a dramatic win in the RAC to secure the No. 2 seed in the Big Ten. Will the Wildcats be able to make it two straight on the road against Steve Pikiell Cliff Omoruyi and the Scarlet Knights? No. 7: vs. Michigan State (6.38) Following a Sweet 16 appearance last year and the return of multiple cogs the Spartans are considered one of the better teams in the Big Ten entering this season. MSU ranked second in the preseason conference poll and even garnered four first-place votes. No. 6: at Indiana (5.63) Northwestern was just one of two teams to down the Hoosiers in Assembly Hall last year. The Wildcats will make the trip east to Bloomington yet again against an IU team departing stalwarts in Trayce Jackson-Davis and Jalen Hood-Schifino. No. 5: vs. Purdue (5.5) You can bet that there will be no better place to be than Evanston on Dec. 1 when Northwestern opens its conference slate on a Friday night against the vaunted Boilermakers. We all know what happened the last time Zach Edey and Matt Painter made the trip to WRA after all. No. 4: at Illinois (5) Boo Buie scored a career-best 35 points (in the No. 4 jersey no less) the last time NU ventured to Champaign. Another spirited matchup should be in the works on the second day of January. No. 3: at Maryland (3) UMD went an astonishing 16-1 in the Xfinity Center a season ago. One of those 16 wins was a 75-59 dismantling of Northwestern; the ‘Cats will look to avenge that result in one of their toughest games of the year. No. 2: at Michigan State (2.25) One of the more improbable stats for the Wildcats is that they’ve won their last two games in the Breslin Center. On top of that Northwestern has won three of its last four games against Tom Izzo. Could more magic be in store in East Lansing in early March? No. 1: at Purdue (1.38) At long last the hardest game on NU’s schedule comes in Mackey Arena where the Boilermakers have lost just four (!) games in the last three seasons. Taking down Purdue at home is certainly impressive but to enter West Lafayette is as ghoulish task as possible for any team.

Share this story At long last Northwestern will play basketball in less than a month. To celebrate we’ll continue our preseason coverage of Wildcat women’s basketball by looking at the team’s projected reserves for the year ahead. The sophomore from Pennsylvania has a family history steeped in all types of athletics. Her grandfather Bob played for the Cincinnati Bengals and later called the Super Bowl for NBC; her second cousin Mike played running back for the Wildcats from 2009-13 and both her parents played basketball at Robert Morris University. After a junior year in the Pennsylvania prep leagues in which she averaged 13.2 points and 7.6 rebounds per game Trumpy tore her ACL in October of 2021 during her volleyball season. That volleyball team won multiple PIAA titles and the basketball team made it to both the MPC title game and the PIAA tournament during Trumpy’s senior season. Standing at 6-foot-5 Trumpy combines size with a great knowledge of the game honed by serving as a de facto assistant for her high school team while recovering from the injury. She didn’t receive any action last year but with Courtney Shaw’s departure there’s a chance for Trumpy to make an impact.  One of three international players on the 2023-24 roster Goodchild hails from Sydney Australia. She has nearly half a decade of international play under her belt including tournaments like the U15 Oceania tournament the U16 Asia tournament and the U17 World Cup. Goodchild earned a scholarship to the Australian Institute of Sport and also was on the Bendigo Spirit which won the U20 national championship of South Wales. Goodchild had other Power Five offers but chose Northwestern and became a fairly common rotational player. In 15 games last season Goodchild scored 30 points and grabbed five rebounds. She was excellent from the free throw line sinking seven of her eight attempts but shot just 5-of-19 from behind the arc. The lack of rebounding (just five total last season) and ball control (11 turnovers to just one assist) prevented her from receiving more playing time but with another offseason under her belt Goodchild could see those minutes take a big jump. The first-year is no stranger to tough competition thanks to a decorated four-year career in Olney Maryland near Washington D.C. During her junior year Mutombo averaged 10 points and eight rebounds per game to help lead Good Counsel to a 10-2 record and a top 5 spot in the DC area. During her senior year Mutombo was WCAC honorable mention and also reached the GUAA finals with her AAU team in 2022. After dealing with tough competition and establishing herself as one of the best Mutombo will have a chance to do it again in the Big Ten. At 6-foot-3 she’s tied with Caileigh Walsh in height and behind only Mercy Ademusayo and Trumpy on this Wildcats squad. That height could be key in Big Ten play.  ""One of three first-years to join the Wildcats this year Harter much like Mutombo made a name for herself in east coast basketball. Playing for Souderton High School in Pennsylvania Harter reached back-to-back SOL titles and PIAA Class 6A playoff tournaments. Aside from team success theres also plenty of individual success to like. In her senior season Harter was named first-team all-region after averaging 16.1 points 6.6 rebounds and 2.6 assists per game. She closed out her high school career with 1211 total points finishing third all time in Souderton history."" Recruiting really picked up after Harter’s success on the AAU circuit (her team reached a GUAA Elite 8) but Northwestern beat out programs like Providence Harvard and Loyola Maryland. Harter’s versatility and defensive acumen should be key for the Wildcats over her career and if she’s able to continue improving her long-range shooting Harter has a chance to move up in the rotation quickly.     \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story You know how in movies that involve some sort of high-speed pursuit (whether in a race or in a police chase of some sort) the villain will always look back and be shocked to see the protagonist still in their rearview mirror? Then they’ll make a face and slam the steering wheel or something and hit the gas even harder? This Wildcats team is that movie protagonist. The ‘Cats may not win every single chase but they will be in it until the very end. Since September began if you ignore the sweeps at the hands of top-15 teams Northwestern volleyball is 7-4 (meaning that even including the sweeps the Wildcats have a winning record since September). Of those four losses two have come in the fifth set and in the other two Northwestern’s opponents won a total of one set by more than three points. The schedule ahead isn’t easy with ranked opponents like Minnesota and Nebraska looming but these Wildcats have proven that they can make any match a battle. Wildcats wobble late in multiple sets against Michigan Coming off of an upset win over then-No. 17 Purdue the Wildcats were flying high as they arrived in Ann Arbor. The energy level was right where it needed to be and after absorbing a few runs from the Wolverines Northwestern knotted the first set at 10 apiece. The ‘Cats then slowly began to pull away thanks to Averie Hernandez and Ellee Stinson stretching the lead to 20-15. Unfortunately it was at that precise moment when the gas tank hit empty. Michigan closed the set on a 10-3 run to take the opening frame 25-23. The refueling process took a good chunk of the second set. The Wildcats went down 6-2 early before quickly working their way back into the game and earning a 10-9 lead. Northwestern would once again slowly but surely push its way into a semi-comfortable lead going up 22-19 thanks in part to some Leilani Dodson defensive action. Michigan went on a late run to make things tricky but the ‘Cats stood their ground and Alexa Rousseau closed out the second set with an ace. Northwestern tied the match at one set apiece and looked to continue building on the momentum in set three. That trend though was short-lived. Maddy Chinn helped build an early 7-5 lead but the Wolverines forced a timeout after going on a 7-2 run. Gigi Navarette and Julia Sangiacomo assisted Northwestern’s push back in front at 18-17 but the Wolverines had another late run in them. A 4-0 Michigan spurt opened the lead to 22-19 and while Northwestern was able to threaten it failed to tie the set up again. Michigan took set three 25-23. The Wolverines then went for the jugular to open the fourth set. A 6-0 run to start backed the ‘Cats into a corner but they fought out of it quickly. A 5-0 Northwestern stretch followed by some strong defense from Kennedy Hill led to an 11-10 lead for the Wildcats. However the Wolverines found another gear. An 8-2 run closed the book on any hopes of a Northwestern win and while NU was able to reduce the gap to 20-17 it was too little too late. Michigan took the fourth set 25-20 and the match 3-1. There were still some bright spots for the Wildcats. Three players (Stinson Rousseau and Navarette) had double-digit digs and Sangiacomo led the match with 16 kills. However a team hitting percentage of just .117 and a paltry 42 kills meant that Northwestern couldn’t topple the Wolverines. The team would have another chance to beat a Michigan squad however and it was the same team that had stunned the purple and white at home the week prior. Road revenge in East Lansing After the tough five-set loss at home on Sept. 29 Northwestern was out to right wrongs when the team showed up to face off against Michigan State. Much like in the first matchup between these two teams it was competitive and emotional throughout. The first set alone saw a pair of lead changes and 11 ties. In the end it was the Spartans who came out on top despite Hernandez once again getting off to a hot start against them. Thanks to a late 3-0 run Michigan State took the opening set 25-22. The Wildcats wouldn’t let that stand partially thanks to Stinson. A pair of aces by Stinson (spectacular poker hand by the way) sparked a ‘Cat run that put Northwestern up 10-7 early. Thanks to a great frontline attack led by Hernandez and Rousseau the lead continued to grow all the way up to 19-13. Northwestern once again showed its ability to close better than Evanston restaurants once the clock strikes 10 winning the set 25-16. There were seven ties in the frame but they all came very early; the set wound up being a tale of domination from the ‘Cats. The third set was more of the same but Michigan State refused to go away. Sangiacomo reached her 15th kill before either team hit five points in the third set and her offensive prowess resulted in a 9-6 lead for Northwestern early. The back-and-forth action continued from there with Sangiacomo once again delivering powerful kills to give the ‘Cats a 17-13 lead and forcing a Spartan timeout. MSU would cut the deficit to two but Northwestern once again slammed the door behind Hernandez and Hill. With its back against the wall the host team came out on fire in the fourth set. Michigan State generated an 8-3 lead before Northwestern clawed back to tie things up. Sangiacomo got yet another kill to give Northwestern an 11-10 lead and Rousseau flashed her skills as well as the Wildcats built a 16-12 advantage. Yet NU was unable to close the deal in the fourth set and Michigan State tied the set at 23-23. The Spartans then took the final three points of the set to win 26-24 and force a winner-take-all fifth set. For the second time in just over a week Michigan State and Northwestern went to a decisive fifth set. And for the second time in just over a week the road team was able to pull it off. Northwestern established several narrow leads early in the set and Hernandez sparked a 3-0 run that gave the Wildcats a 9-6 advantage. Michigan State was able to claw back to 12-10 but Sangiacomo notched a kill on two of the final three points of the set (and the match). Northwestern won 15-10 and avenged its home loss by dealing one to the Spartans. Sangiacomo and Hernandez completely dominated the match. The graduate transfer put up 32 kills and 11 digs (her second double-double of the year) and Hernandez garnered more kills in this single match (17) then she did in the entirety of her freshman season (15). Rousseau also had the offense running cleaner than a bottle of Windex totaling three aces and 50 assists. The road trip to the Great Lakes State was a major success. The Wildcats once again proved their clutch mettle and offensive firepower and it’s clear that the team is gelling rapidly. The momentum from early September has carried into early October but with a 2-4 record in conference play there’s still a lot of ground to make up. The games this coming week — a home affair with Maryland and a road contest with No. 24 Minnesota — will say a lot about how competitive this team can be in the race for the Big Ten. But one thing’s for sure: the Wildcats always going to be right there in the rearview mirror.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Share this story Northwestern softball’s leader is here for the long term. Head coach Kate Drohan and NU have agreed to a multi-year extension to keep Drohan at the helm of the program Northwestern announced on Thursday morning. The extension comes after Drohan led the Wildcats to a Big Ten Championship and NCAA Super Regional appearance this spring. “I am honored to call Northwestern home” Drohan said in a statement. “The championship tradition of our program built by Sharon Drysdale our 247 letterwinners and so many stakeholders have made Northwestern an incredibly special place. Our work on the softball field is uniquely aligned with our academic mission and it brings me great joy to celebrate our championships on the field and the remarkable success of our alumni after they graduate.  “I continue to choose Northwestern because I believe there is no other place in the country that intertwines and supports our work on the softball field in the classroom and in the community at this championship level.” Since taking over the program in 2002 Drohan has racked up 745 career wins putting her inside the top five in Big Ten History. She has taken the ‘Cats to 16 NCAA Regional Tournaments seven NCAA Super Regionals and three Women’s College World Series. “Kate Drohan stands among the nation’s coaching elite consistently choosing Northwestern at every juncture of her remarkable career” NU athletic director Derrick Gragg said in a statement. “Under her leadership our softball program has consistently established itself as one of the top programs in the nation — a testament to her unwavering commitment to excellence. Coming off back-to-back Big Ten championships her team’s shared goals are clear: to continue their upward trajectory demonstrating their success is not a destination but a foundation upon which they are determined to build.” Drohan’s extension comes off the heels of Gragg telling Inside NU on Oct. 4 that the University is looking to renovate its softball stadium. No official announcement of construction has been made as of today. “On a personal level I love raising my daughter in Evanston and have so many incredible friendships with colleagues alumni and our Northwestern community that makes our work that much more meaningful” Drohan concluded in her statement. “Go ‘Cats!”  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Following a 1-11 campaign last season and a hazing scandal that has made national headlines no one expected much of anything from Northwestern football in 2023. However to our collective surprise the ‘Cats enter the bye at .500 after a string of victories against UTEP Minnesota and Howard. These early results leave Northwestern in contention for a bowl game a conversation that seemed an afterthought only a couple of weeks ago. The most straightforward path for the Wildcats to make a bowl game is to win at least three games against their remaining competition — which is comprised of only Big Ten opponents — but even reaching the five-win watermark could open the door. So let’s take a look at each of Northwestern’s remaining matchups and assess which ones give the ‘Cats the best path to bowl season. Oct. 21 at Nebraska Opponent Record: 3-3 (1-2 Conference) The ‘Cats start off the second half of their season against the one team they beat last year that being Nebraska. The Cornhuskers led by former Baylor and Carolina Panthers head coach Matt Rhule share the same record as the ‘Cats.  The Cornhuskers’ only home wins this season have come against non-Power Five schools having defeated Northern Illinois and Louisiana Tech in back-to-back weeks. They also took down Illinois on the road last week snatching a 20-7 victory in Urbana-Champaign.  These developments make Nebraska a very beatable opponent for the ‘Cats. I would be much more confident in a victory if Northwestern were the home team but since this game is being played in Lincoln the result is very much up in the air. It obviously won’t be a cake walk but if Ben Bryant and A.J. Henning return at full strength — both are expected to play after being sidelined against Howard — the ‘Cats certainly have a chance to win this game and defeat the Huskers for a second year in a row. Oct. 28 vs. Maryland Opponent Record: 5-1 (2-1 Conference) Maryland lost its first game of the season this past weekend falling to Ohio State. Indeed at times it looked like the Terps were the better team keeping the third-ranked team in the country at arm’s length.  Even with the loss the Terrapins have been nothing short of excellent so far. Taulia Tagovailoa — whose last name should ring a bell for any NFL fans reading this — has been phenomenal registering almost 1700 yards in the air with 14 touchdowns and five interceptions. As for the ‘Cats their final Big Ten East game of the season will not be easy. NU has enjoyed somewhat of a home field advantage all season long but the Terps might simply be too much to overcome. While students have been advised to dress for the annual “blackout” game it might also be worth preparing for a possible blowout. Nov. 4 vs. Iowa (Wrigley Game) Opponent Record: 5-1 (2-1 conference) For the first time since 2021 the ‘Cats return to Wrigley Field this time with Iowa as the opponent. The Hawkeyes just lost Cade McNamara for the season with a torn ACL with backup Deacon Hill taking the reins. A less favorable crowd than a normal home game combined with a fierce opponent makes this matchup another challenging one for the ‘Cats. While McNamara might be gone this Iowa team is still solid even though its offense ranks among the worst in the entire country. The ‘Cats would need an offensive spark to give them a chance but such hasn’t come easy so far this year. The Hawkeyes control their destiny in the Big Ten West and will certainly see this game as a must-win before a possible make-or-break showdown against Wisconsin. Expect a low-scoring affair but I’d give the obvious edge to Iowa here. Nov. 11 at Wisconsin Opponent Record: 4-1 (2-0 Conference) I’ll keep this one brief. The ‘Cats have a very slim chance of beating the Badgers especially in Madison. Expect Braelon Allen to rip apart this defense which has been particularly poor against the run. Tanner Mordecai also has his off days but he shouldn’t have much trouble here either. Simply put Wisconsin is a much better football team and there’s little that Northwestern can do to counteract that — especially at Camp Randall Stadium. Opportunities for victories exist in this ‘Cats schedule but this game likely won’t be one of them. Nov. 18 vs. Purdue Opponent Record: 2-4 (1-2 Conference) In the final home game of the season I actually expect the ‘Cats to pull off the win against Purdue (hopefully I’m not being too overconfident). The Boilermakers have had a litany of struggles this season and appear very beatable. Purdue’s only convincing win of the season came against Illinois which isn’t an overwhelming feat by any means. The Boilermakers also beat Virginia Tech but have fallen short against Fresno State Syracuse and Big Ten foes Wisconsin and Iowa.  As for the ‘Cats the opportunity is theirs for the taking. This offense should be able to step up against a fairly weak defense and possibly deliver the home fans a hard-earned victory to savor into next season. Only time will tell though. Nov. 25 at Illinois Opponent Record: 2-4 (0-3 Conference) Alas we’ve reached Northwestern’s showdown with the Fighting Illini. This should be the most winnable game of the bunch against a squad that looks aimless halfway through the season. Illinois’ offense has been utterly abysmal as of late averaging less than 16 points per game over their last four matchups. Don’t expect this number to improve ahead of showdowns against Maryland and Wisconsin these next two weeks.  In regards to the ‘Cats this should be a slam dunk. Nevertheless nothing is a guarantee and this game shouldn’t be taken lightly. The ‘Cats tend to struggle away from home and might find some trouble in hostile territory. I worry that this team will play down to competition as it has done in the past but hope that the resilience it has shown so far will guide NU to a victory here. I’d favor the ‘Cats in this one a month-and-a-half out but there’s still plenty of time for this prediction to change. Final Thoughts If you asked me to predict today whether or not the ‘Cats will make a bowl game I’d unfortunately answer in the negative. Regardless of these predictions this schedule is not an easy one and finding three games that I can confidently say the Wildcats can win isn’t as straightforward as one may think. If you had to ask me I would say that winning against Nebraska Purdue and Illinois is the likeliest scenario but also one that isn’t probable. Favoring or having optimism for Northwestern in these games is one thing but winning them all is another. The reality is indeed that this won’t be easy. But against all the odds so far Northwestern football has prevailed in so many more ways than we anticipated. Now we wait and see whether the ‘Cats have it in them to do it again. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Earlier this week Northwestern women’s golf traveled to Medinah Illinois for its third competition of the season — the Illini Women’s Invitational. At the invitational the Wildcats placed third overall out of 15 teams and tallied an overall score of 850 or -14 on the par 72 course. Out of those 15 teams five of them (LSU Mississippi San Jose State Georgia Houston) rank higher than Northwestern’s No. 29 ranking in Golfweek’s team collegiate rankings. This third-place finish marked Northwestern’s second top-three finish of the season with the first one being a second-place showing at the Windy City Invitational last week. The only two teams that placed ahead of the Wildcats at the Illini Invite were No. 14 LSU and No. 8 Mississippi. Northwestern ended the first round in sixth place with a 3-over-par score of 291; sophomore Dianna Lee was the only golfer to shoot under par — getting a birdie. This round was the Wildcats’ most inconsistent of the three as the best and worst scorers were separated by five strokes (compared to four strokes in the second round and two in the third round). During Round Two the Wildcats performed significantly better. They tied SMU as the best-performing team of the whole round earning an 11-under-par score of 277. That moved the team up to second place overall only behind LSU. Freshman Ashley Yun shined in the second round shooting 4-under to tie SMU’s Ellie Szeryk and Georgia’s Caterina Don as the top individual scorers of the round. Junior Lauren Nguyen had a great round as well by hitting 3-under par and both Lee and senior Jennifer Cai recorded eagles. Meanwhile senior Jieni Li posted an at-par score of 72. Northwestern continued its momentum from the second round into the third recording a 6-under-par score of 282 and tying Houston as the fifth-best-performing team of the round. Once again all of NU shot under par in round three. Lee and Nguyen netted eagles Cai and Yun earned birdies and Li matched her Round Two score with an even-par. However Mississippi had a phenomenal third round recording a score of 273 (the best score of round three) after hitting a 289 in Round Two and a 284 in Round One — allowing the Rebels to move up from fourth and beat Northwestern for second. Ole Miss ended up with an overall score of 846 besting the Wildcats by just four strokes. Individually Lee was NU’s highest finisher tying Mississippi’s Caitlyn Macnab for sixth with a score of 211. Lee was the only Northwestern golfer to hit under par in every round. Nguyen the Windy City Invite individual champion also placed in the top 10 by tying for ninth with a 212. Cai and Yun scored 215 points apiece and tied for 19th while Li had a score of 217 to tie for 27th. Sophomore Jiayi Wang who only participated in individual competition established a 220 to tie for 40th. Next week Northwestern will travel to the west coast to compete at the Stanford Intercollegiate Invitational from Oct. 20 to the 22nd. Stanford which is currently ranked No. 2 in Golfweek’s polls will be one of the toughest opponents that the Wildcats will have to face this season.

Share this story Northwestern has secured a huge initial victory in its goal of rebuilding Ryan Field — but with a major caveat. On Wednesday night the Evanston Land Use Commission voted 9-0 to recommend the overhaul of Ryan Field but did not recommend NU’s request for rezoning to allow for concerts at the stadium. The Commission struck down the rezoning proposal 7-2. “While we appreciate the commission’s support of the new stadium we are disappointed in the commission’s non-binding recommendation of the complete project without concerts” Hilary Hurd Anyaso Northwestern’s Director of Media Relations said in a statement.  “However we remain encouraged by the support of thousands of residents who support this project and we are hopeful the City Council will vote to approve the new stadium in its entirety. As the University conveyed to the commission for the project to move forward a modest number of concerts are needed. Evanston has never seen a project of this magnitude that is generational and will have lasting positive impacts on the City’s economy and broader community. There is precedent for the City Council to approve projects after a commission has recommended against and we are hopeful that will be the case with the stadium proposal.”  In order for Ryan Field to host concerts the area would have to be rezoned for commercial use. The current zoning allows the stadium to only be used for academic and athletic purposes. The votes come after a series of three commission hearings on the new Ryan Field. While the Land Use Commission makes these recommendations to the Evanston City Council the City Council does have the final say over the project and the zoning. The City Council can adopt the Commission’s recommendations adopt parts of the recommendations or ignore them entirely. Northwestern intends to begin demolition on the existing Ryan Field at the end of the 2023 football season and have its new stadium ready to go by the start of the 2026 campaign. Now that power rests in the hands of the City Council which will meet at a date to be determined in the near future.

Share this story Welcome back to the film room everybody. While the Wildcats are on their bye week that doesn’t mean that we take weeks off to break down QB play. The ‘Cats took on the Howard Bison this past weekend for homecoming and the FCS team gave NU a battle to the final whistle. Although Northwestern held on for a 23-20 victory it had multiple opportunities to bust the game wide open. Heading into the contest NU was shorthanded due to injuries. Starting QB Ben Bryant missed the game with an upper-body injury so Brendan Sullivan lined up behind center against Howard. It was Sullivan’s first start since Week 10 of 2022 when he left the game early with an injury. In his first start of the season the junior showed some flashes but struggled in other areas. The Numbers It was an efficient day for Sullivan who finished 13-for-18 for 131 yards and two touchdowns. His performance earned him a 64.2 PFF passing grade. His 7.4 yards per attempt was the highest mark in his career (in games he played four quarters). No. 6 had one PFF Big-Time Throw (a pass with excellent ball location and timing generally thrown further down the field and/or into a tighter window) but had no turnover-worthy plays. On the ground Sullivan added 58 yards and a touchdown but he did put the ball on the turf once. The ‘Cats’ QB garnered a 58.7 PFF run grade. The junior felt the heat on Saturday being pressured 12 times. Despite being under duress Sullivan only attempted four passes under pressure completing two. It was a conservative game plan from NU which only attempted six throws more than 10 yards down the field. Here is a breakdown of all of Sullivan’s tosses. To be honest the numbers do not reflect how the tape looks; in fact the two look like direct opposites. So without further ado let’s dive into the film.. The Good There were multiple moments throughout Saturday’s game where Sullivan really shined. While it wasn’t always pretty the Davison Michigan native did just enough to lead NU to victory. This is the part of Sullivan’s game that really excites Northwestern fans. He’s able to make something out of nothing and showed it multiple times against the Bison. This play was just pure athleticism. Off play action Sullivan boots to the weak side of the field and takes off downfield. It looked like a short gain but he was able to tiptoe down the sideline before cutting back inside and turning on the jets for a 35-yard touchdown. These are the plays that make Sullivan so electrifying because he can create big moments with his legs. This was NU’s first opening drive touchdown of the season and it was No. 6’s rushing ability that led to the score. This single play encapsulated my takeaways from Saturday’s game. Mike Bajakian went back to his wheelhouse and called the fake screen wheel which was a perfect play call against the Bison’s Cover Two defense. Cam Johnson is wide open instantly but Sullivan does not pull the trigger. This ball should have been out two seconds before he finally released it taking the hole shot for the easy first down. Instead the ‘Cats’ backup bailed to his right. Luckily for the Wildcats Howard never picked up Johnson who ran free down the sideline.  Where Sullivan’s athleticism shines through is his pass to Johnson. The Michigan native never sets a platform yet effortlessly flicks one 35 yards off his back foot to hit the sixth-year in stride. The junior was able to compensate for his initial mistake with a freakish type of throw.  While this play was a touchdown similar mistakes almost cost NU the game so let’s dive into the negatives of Sullivan’s performance.  The Bad Although he completed over 70% of his passes Sullivan struggled when dropping back against the Bison. The ‘Cats’ backup did not look comfortable under center and he especially faced issues with his decision-making. Watching this game back I couldn’t help but feel that Sullivan was hesitant to throw the ball. No. 6 had 3.23 seconds to get rid of the ball yet still scrambled often. This play was the turning point of the game. With a conversion on fourth down the game is over. Northwestern can run at least another minute off the clock and go up three scores. Howard brings five blitzers including the slot corner coming free; however both Bryce Kirtz and Thomas Gordon are wide open on curl routes. This should be a one-hitch and throw from Sullivan yet he does not pull the trigger and tries to bail out of the pocket but gets pulled down for a sack and a turnover on downs. This is a basic play one that any quarterback needs to make. The junior looked at the open receiver with plenty of time before the rusher got home but didn’t throw it. The more I watch it the more infuriated I get because this is such a simple concept that he needs to complete. On the next play Howard takes it 64 yards for a touchdown to cut it to an 11-point game pulling itself right back in the game. If Sullivan wants to be a B1G starter these are the plays he has to make. This is another play that made me go “What are you doing?” Howard drops seven into coverage and only rushes four which the Wildcats’ O-line picks up easily. Yet Sullivan drops his head and takes off running even though the pocket is perfectly clean. There is no reason for the ‘Cats’ gun slinger to bail; in fact he needs to stay in the pocket and step up. It became clear that Sully was working to his first read and scrambling if it wasn’t there. There is more than enough time to wait for the pass catchers to get open but No. 6 doesn’t even give his targets a chance. To play football at the Big Ten level you have to be able to sit in the pocket and deliver the ball down the field. So far Sullivan has not shown he is capable of doing that. First this is a hell of a catch by Johnson. Second Sullivan needs to get rid of this RPO quicker. The corner is playing eight yards off the ball and bailing on the snap and Kirtz is running a five-yard hitch. There is the leverage get the ball to the outside now. Both inside defenders step up in catch-man so the decision has been made for Sullivan. On an RPO the ball has to come out; otherwise the referees will always throw a flag for an ineligible man downfield. Once again it is the minute details that separate Big Ten starters from backups and Sullivan has to improve if he wants to take the reins of the ‘Cats’ offense in the future. Final Thoughts After watching Sullivan against Bison I think it is finally time for the debates surrounding the Wildcats’ quarterback room to end. Ben Bryant is the starting quarterback for Northwestern because he gives NU the best chance to win. While more athletic Sullivan still needs to develop mentally before he can start in the Big Ten.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story There is college basketball next month. The people rejoice. We now continue our preseason coverage of Wildcats basketball by taking a look at the reserves for the men’s basketball team. One of three first years on the squad this season Barkley is a 6-foot-7 forward from Morgantown West Virginia. During his junior season of high school Barkley earned OVAC First Team All-Conference honors before transferring to Putnam Science Academy. While on the Adidas 3SSB circuit in the spring and summer of 2022 Barkley averaged 13.5 points and 8.2 rebounds per game. A three-star on Rivals.com he also received offers from Akron and Northern Illinois among other schools but committed to Northwestern less than two weeks after he visited last September. Barkley’s length could be useful in the second or third rotation this year. Clayton also hails from the East Coast and played his high school basketball at Bradford Christian Academy in Haverhill Massachusetts. The three-star prospect was ranked as the third-best player in Massachusetts by 247Sports partially thanks to his 12 points and five assists per game as a junior. Clayton also saw lots of success on the AAU circuit helping his Mass Rivals team to a 15-4 record in the Adidas 3SSSB class. Clayton was the first commit of the Northwestern class of 2027 signing a letter of intent and verbally committing in August 12 of last year. Northwestern won out over Cal UMass and Stephen F. Austin as well as several other schools. Hurlburt hails from Enderlin South Dakota and basketball is in his blood. His aunt Cindy Haugejorde is still the all-time leading rebounder at the University of Iowa with 1067 rebounds over her collegiate career. His mother Sonja played basketball at the University of San Francisco and his twin brother Joe currently plays at Colorado. Hurlburt was a preferred walk-on commit after receiving offers from mostly Division III schools and mid-major Division I schools. While his brother was more heavily recruited Gus had an excellent high school career averaging 17 points and nine rebounds per game in a senior year that earned him a spot on the North Dakota All-State Second Team. Hurlburt did not see action last year but with Robbie Beran and Tydus Verhoeven departing there’s a chance for the big man to get lots of action at power forward. Smith was a deep bench player last year appearing in three games and playing in five total minutes in his freshman season. Smith played high school basketball in Pennsylvania and his basketball roots are firmly planted in the East Coast; his father Larry walked on at North Carolina and played alongside current UNC head coach Hubert Davis. Smith’s best game by far came in the win over Chicago State on Nov. 7 2022. He garnered both his first career points and first career rebound in his singular minute of action hitting the only shot (so far) of his collegiate career. Smith also played two minutes in both the DePaul and UIC contests last season but did not put up any other stats. If Smith can put on a bit more weight (he’s listed at 6-foot-6 as tall as Brooks Barnhizer but also 40 pounds lighter) then he may get some chances to fill the void left by Chase Audige and Julian Roper II. There’s a lot to like about the 6-foot-3 point guard the final first-year on the Wildcats’ roster. While Northwestern was his only Power Six offer (other schools to offer him included Colorado State and Wyoming) Strauss has the chance to be a difference maker immediately. His defensive instincts are obvious: 2.8 steals per game as a senior after 2.9 steals per game as a junior. Strauss is a versatile guard who could probably play both guard spots — he led his high school team in points rebounds assists and steals per game in his junior year and led them to a Division 2A quarterfinal berth in the California state playoffs. As a senior he averaged 11.3 points 7.1 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game and his team made it to the CIF Division II title game. Strauss also set the school record for the 1600 meter relay while participating in track and field. As with Smith Strauss could have a chance to become the Wildcats’ fifth guard.     \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

With the bye week upon us I will be enjoying the outdoors and going apple picking. The Gold family loves apple cider donuts so will definitely be picking up some of those. Also will probably hit up Richardson’s family farms for a corn maze and a pumpkin patch. John Olsen: The same as every other Saturday — not watching Northwestern football.

Share this story Here. We. Go. Basketball season is just about three weeks away from tipping off at Welsh-Ryan Arena which means it’s time for us here at Inside NU to dive headfirst into player previews. Working our way up the rotation today we’ll take a look at Mercy Ademusayo who might be Northwestern’s best paint defender. Who she is Junior; forward; 6-foot-4; from Ode Irele Nigeria 2022-23 stats 16 games 4.5 minutes per game 1.7 points per game 1.1 rebounds per game 0.1 assists per game 0.9 blocks per game 44% FG% 33.3% FT% 2022-23 review In her freshman 2021-22 season Ademusayo didn’t see the court that often because of Northwestern’s loaded frontcourt which featured Courtney Shaw Caileigh Walsh and Paige Mott. That didn’t change in 2022-23 as NU brought back every single forward. It’s why Ademusayo only averaged around five minutes a contest even though she consistently made a defensive impact off the bench. Her best game came early on in a November blowout loss to then-No. 9 Notre Dame. Walsh Shaw and Jasmine McWilliams were all ejected in the first half which gave Ademusayo a chance to play a season-high 13 minutes. She certainly made her presence felt scoring six points while racking up six rebounds two assists and three blocks. While Ademusayo never played more than eight minutes in a game the rest of the season most of her performances followed that blueprint. Joe McKeown would typically deploy her in short spurts to generate a defensive spark.  Look no further than her fourth-quarter sequence against Minnesota in February. NU had opened up a 14-point lead on the Golden Gophers a minute into the final period and was looking to put the game away right there. Minnesota’s Isabelle Gradwell drove for a layup to try and keep her team within reach only for this to happen: Thanks to her ferocious block rim running and boxout Ademusayo created a four-point swing by herself. She only played eight minutes in Northwestern’s 76-62 win but brought forth a crucial momentum boost. Sequences like these encapsulated Ademusayo’s season which makes it interesting to see how she’ll fare if her playing time takes a jump in 2023-24. Strengths Sample size requirements are such a buzzkill.  Extrapolating this Ademusayo would have averaged 5.1 blocks a contest if she averaged Walsh’s 24.7 minutes per game. Her per-40 minutes mark stood at 8.5 blocks. She had the third-highest block total on the team with 15 even though she played just 72 total minutes. Mott who finished last year with 14 rejections played 709. Of course it’s never that simple; Ademusayo would be the starter if it was. But there’s no denying that she is a talented paint defender. At 6-foot-4 she takes full advantage of her length to cut off drivers’ paths to the rim.  On the other end Ademusayo took strides as a post player. Her footwork tended to look much cleaner than it did in her first year which allowed her to take the majority of her shots inside the restricted area. Within that range the junior shot 8-of-12 which demonstrates how her power and size can make her a force to be reckoned with if she can make her way inside. Weaknesses If Ademusayo can extend her shooting range even to the midrange area then she can take her game to another level. She shot just 3-of-11 in the paint outside of the restricted area in 2022-23 and made a third of her free throws. Considering the offensive versatility that Walsh brings to the table as a three-level scorer that’s not something McKeown’s offense can survive on for extended periods of play against Big Ten opponents with perimeter players that can score in bunches. Granted Ademusayo’s role as a sparkplug didn’t require her to do that. In games like the Minnesota victory she functioned as the thunder to Walsh’s lightning. McKeown threw opponents a curveball by having Ademusayo do the grunt work down low while lineups featuring four perimeter players spaced the floor and let the ‘Cats play inside-out. Should Ademusayo expand her offensive arsenal with some more touches though Northwestern could be in for a treat. Expectations Walsh and Mott will remain at the top of the depth chart which makes forecasting Ademusayo’s junior season challenging. There’s a shot that she takes on the same role as in 2022-23 with marginally more playing time. There’s an equal chance that she takes on Shaw’s minutes as the first big to come off the bench. Either way she will play a critical role and any leap she takes could benefit the Wildcats in a huge way. Look for Ademusayo to continue improving as an offensive player with another year under her belt. Whether that means she becomes a better passer a better shooter or is simply more efficient inside it’s a goal within reach. Northwestern often found itself slipping away in the middle quarters so Ademusayo’s scoring off the bench could help the second unit remedy that. On the defensive side even maintaining her production from last year could pay off handsomely with some more minutes. The cherry on top would be if Ademusayo becomes more mobile and starts to really defend pick-and-rolls well. If that happens NU’s team defense will add an extremely valuable layer. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story For the first time all season it was a Saturday of college football with no Northwestern logos shown with the Wildcats on a bye week — and very probably providing the first lax week surrounding the program since early July. As the three Inside NU Editors-in-Chief attempted to recoup and reset (who are we kidding Northwestern students hardly do that) we also answered your questions regarding all things NU. Below are our thoughts on the remaining football slate the new Ryan Field university leadership and much more. “Can you compare the state of fandom at this point to what it was like at this time last year? Or maybe easier which dining hall has the best food these days?” -@Cyan220 Bradley: I would venture to say that Northwestern football fandom is probably in a slightly better spot than in October of last year. In 2022 there was a sense of almost “How much longer can this go?” with real angst about whether or not the Wildcats would win another game. There was also definite embarrassment and growing disdain for Pat Fitzgerald as a coach. Now though I think most NU fans feel as if there’s little to lose in 2023; while a good number of supporters have their eyes already geared toward 2024 there are also those who are actually eager to watch the second half of a football season something that may not be true since 2020. Combining the aesthetics number of options and location Allison is definitely my No. 1. It might be the only dining hall I can somewhat reliably count on for any pasta. David: I’m going to answer both questions. Even with everything that happened this summer I think the state of fandom especially among students is higher than it was a year ago. It is cliche but winning cures all. At their bye last season the ‘Cats were 1-5 and had just been blown out 42-7 on homecoming. It was clear that the team was in decline and people were done with the season midway through.  This season Northwestern is 3-3 including a fun win over Minnesota and has shown glimpses of promise heading into the back half of the season. It sure feels like more people are paying attention and heading to Ryan Field than they were 365 days ago. As for dining halls there is only one correct answer and it is not even a dining hall. I will say Restaurant Gold — my apartment — is the best place to get a meal. I whip up a mean brisket all the way to penne alla vodka. Iggy can attest to my work. Iggy: Unlike Northwestern football against Duke David was certainly cooking. It goes Allison Plex (the stir fry location and hours are carrying harder than 2018 LeBron here) Elder Sarge. End of discussion. The state of the fandom especially given what unfolded this summer is higher than I could’ve imagined in August. That doesn’t mean crazy high — on a scale of 1 to 10 I’d call it a 4.5. But Northwestern somehow has an outside chance at a bowl game the fanbase is almost entirely behind its head coach and students have shown out at games to a decent extent so far. The first-years got their first dose of Ryan Field football with the wild Minnesota comeback (even if 75% of the crowd left in the third quarter). Unlike in 2022 the Wildcats still have a lot to play for entering mid-October so fans can still dream. “What if any are NU’s efforts to compete in NIL deals and are you aware of how it’s going?” -danwhite77 David: The most I can tell you is Northwestern now has its own NIL collective TrueNU run by former Northwestern football player and director of football operations Jacob Schmidt. We really have no clue how it is going but getting Boo Buie to not only not turn pro but to keep him from transferring means that he probably got a pretty penny to return to Evanston. “When does the AD’s contract expire?” -danwhite77 Iggy: Funny you ask. They did too. “In Braun’s post game comments after PSU he seemed to express remorse about some of his aggressive play calling. But we weren’t going to win (or come close) without aggressive calls. Do you think he’ll be as aggressive going forward?” -danwhite77 Bradley: Being aggressive has been one of Braun’s hallmarks; after all what does a first-time coach at any level really have to lose especially on a one-year trial? I doubt that facet of his decision-making would change just because the team failed on fourth down against Rutgers and Penn State. Frankly in many ways it’s been a welcome modification to Northwestern football — a program which has traditionally erred on the side of conservative play-calling. David: I had no issues with what Braun did against PSU and it didn’t feel like Braun regretted those decisions after the game. The ‘Cats were playing with house money and they had to take a gamble at some point if they were going to upset the No. 6 team in the nation. If anything I feel Braun has been too conservative in some situations. I think he’ll continue to evolve and get more aggressive as the season goes on even if not every decision works. Iggy: I don’t think Braun’s aggressiveness takes a fall off a cliff in Big Ten play but I think the fact that Penn State’s defensive talent utterly overpowered NU was part of the reason why he went for those short fourth downs. He felt like he had to make the most of every possession where the ‘Cats had a remote chance to keep the football and tried to. Yet he’s also been conservative before. On the opening drive against Minnesota he punted on a fourth-and-1 from about midfield because he felt “it could really be a game that possessions were limited.” Folks if that doesn’t scream late-season Big Ten West football for you you need to crawl out from under your rock and turn on your TV. Kidding aside though every opponent left on the schedule is much closer to Minnesota than PSU. I don’t think Braun will dial back the aggressiveness because he failed but more so because of the opponent and a different game flow. “Any idea on whether the stadium will actually happen and if so when?” -danwhite77  David: To be completely honest I have no f**king clue. The Evanston Land Use Commission recommended that the City Council approve the construction of the new stadium but emphatically rejected NU’s request to rezone the stadium to allow for commercial use — a.k.a. concerts. Throughout the hearings Northwestern’s COO Luke Figora said the university will walk away from the project if it can’t host concerts. Whether or not NU is bluffing? Who knows.  What I can say is that the City Council will have the final say and it can overrule any recommendations the LUC made. In my personal belief based on no reporting or speaking to sources I assume that it gets done. Both sides have too much to lose to not get a deal done regardless of any uproar from surrounding neighbors of Ryan Field. If the City Council approves the project Northwestern has stated it expects to open the new Ryan Field in 2026. “Do you all want critiques on your columns in the comments or nah? I think most of them are well intended but wanted to see what you think.” -danwhite77 David:  As someone who has had my fair share of negative comments I really don’t mind the critiques at all. I understand that people will not agree with everything and that’s okay. Our readers make this site run so I am grateful for anyone who takes the time to read what a 20-year-old has to say — whether they like what I’m saying or not. Iggy: What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger! Bradley: As long as the feedback isn’t overly negative or making personal barbs all good here. As David and Iggy said it only enhances our writing. “Please rank the remaining 6 games in terms of the chances Northwestern wins — I’m curious how possible y’all think a path to 6 wins (or 5 I suppose since 5-7 teams can be eligible) is.” -C.E. Bell Bradley: In terms of easiest to hardest: Purdue Illinois Nebraska Iowa Maryland Wisconsin. I don’t see NU getting to six wins — maybe five if everything goes well — just because I don’t trust the Wildcats’ offensive or defensive lines to either hold or up make an impact against only Big Ten competition. The Cornhuskers are definitely beatable but doing so in Memorial Stadium is a much more daunting task. Even playing the Fighting Illini fresh off an impressive win in College Park could prove challenging in Champaign. David: From easiest to hardest: Purdue Illinois Nebraska Iowa Wisconsin Maryland. Out of the three of us I am probably the most confident about Northwestern getting to six wins and it’s not because I am super confident in the Wildcats but it is because I think the rest of the Big Ten West is that bad. The Cornhuskers Boilermakers and Illini are all very beatable but NU is going to have to play clean football to win. With these squads if NU can get to 20 points it should be enough to win these games.  The biggest toss-up for me is Iowa. The Hawkeyes’ defense looks unstoppable but the offense looks even more putrid than last year. With Cade McNamara out for the year it feels like the ‘Cats need to eke out 17 points to win at Wrigley Field. Iggy: Purdue Nebraska Illinois Iowa Maryland Wisconsin. I think NU can win two of the first three. I’d give five wins a 40% chance and I’d put six wins at around 25%. The fact that most of these offenses aren’t impressive gives the Wildcats a chance to hang in any game even if they’re behind.  “Who do you think will be back in 2024-25? Schill Gragg Braun Bajakian etc?” -AyanKB Bradley: Schill and Gragg are almost definitely not going anywhere despite how fans may feel. As mentioned earlier Gragg still has multiple years left on his contract and has the full faith of Schill. Considering Schill was only inaugurated last June I doubt he would be fired solely because of how he handled this past summer — it’s worth noting too that the Board of Trustees probably doesn’t feel as negatively as the general public may. In terms of football coaches I would be very surprised if Bajakian stayed not only because of his lack of offensive success over the last three years but also because of him publicly defending Fitzgerald via a “Cats Against the World” shirt in early August. It wouldn’t shock me whatsoever if most long-term assistants (e.g. Kurt Anderson Tim McGarigle Matt MacPherson Jeff Genyk even Alex Spanos) departed this offseason. In order for Braun to make a truly compelling argument to lose the interim tag he’ll almost definitely have to go 5-7 or better which still may not be sufficient. But I think there’s a sound chance he’d be back as NU’s defensive coordinator. Players have absolutely gravitated to him and are truly impassioned to take the field under his leadership. Plus the Wildcats’ defense has made strides in certain areas even if it has ways to go. David: I agree with Bradley on everything. It is very clear to me that Michael Schill and Derrick Gragg are not going anywhere in the short term.  I do think David Braun will be in Evanston next year but I couldn’t tell you in what capacity. Braun has surprised me this year and I would not be surprised if he had the interim tag removed. It is obvious that the players love playing for Braun and the team has made improvements as the season rolls along. Now it would be perfectly acceptable for NU to hire a more experienced head coach but I wouldn’t be shocked if that coach kept Braun as his DC. Northwestern’s defense is punching above its weight mostly because Braun’s scheme has put the players in a position to succeed. Bajakian and the assistant coaches are a much different story. We can talk about their on-field performance all we want but it is the off-the-field accusations that may make it hard for them to retain their jobs. I find it very difficult to believe that not a single member of the coaching staff especially those who have been at NU for a long time had no inclination that hazing occurred. With that alongside the coaches’ loyalty to Pat Fitzgerald I think many assistants will depart this offseason — whether by choice or by force. Iggy: David and Bradley pretty much touched it all but rankings are fun so I’ll do that. From most to least likely: Schill Gragg Braun LAKE MICHIGAN-SIZED GAP then Bajakian and the coaching staff. Unless Northwestern loses out Braun’s done enough to warrant a return. Whether that’s as the permanent head coach or as the defensive coordinator we’ll see but the team has somehow looked normal even though dozens have indicated their support for Fitzgerald one way or another. He deserves a shot with a brand-new staff assuming Schill and Gragg choose to go in that direction given they’ve already deemed Fitz partially responsible for failing to prevent hazing. “Who’s more likely to win the national title field hockey or lacrosse?” -@BrendanPreisman  David:  Field hockey is dominant right now winning its last 12 games and earning the No. 1 spot in the coaches poll; however I will never bet against the lake show. Especially after Izzy Scane Molly Laliberty and Erin Coykendall all agreed to use their final year of eligibility I would place my entire Inside NU stipend on Lacrosse repeating as national champions. Iggy: I’d say lax but more so because the level of competition at the top for field hockey is so fierce in the Big Ten alone. I do think Tracey Fuchs’ team is the best squad in the country right now after the Iowa win. However even if Northwestern continues bludgeoning teams with its press and fires off a ridiculous number of shots all it takes is a hot goalie for a fluke to happen. Ohio State pushed the ‘Cats and they face two huge Big Ten tests next weekend at Penn State and 13-0 Rutgers. If they can get through those games unscathed then I think it’s a little closer. The Lakeshow is — for the most part — running it back after winning the quarterfinal the semifinal and the championship by an average of 10 goals. That’s a greater goal differential than the NCAA’s best average differential all season (and guess who has that too?) Two of the undisputed top-five players in the nation are coming back and will probably get better fresh off a 20-game win streak where it beat teams that were *checks notes* No. 1 No. 2 No. 3 No. 4 No. 5 No. 9 and No. 10. They also won six more top-20 games. It’s almost unfathomable. Bradley: When a national championship winner returns its basic core of players including the best in the nation I can’t bet against that; my answer would be Northwestern lacrosse so David Iggy and I are on the same wavelength. But I think field hockey has a legitimate chance too. Tracey Fuchs’ team is certainly younger than previous versions — and that lack of postseason experience could be worrisome come November — but this squad has met basically every challenge and has shown no signs of slowing down even against formidable opponents.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It was the West that brought ‘Cats’ fans two Big Ten Championship Game appearances. It was the West that allowed Northwestern to be competitive in a conference chock-full of high-level talent.  Things will not be the same for the ‘Cats next year. More talent is coming and the safeguard that was the West will no longer be there to help shield from it. Especially given the current state of the program Northwestern might be in for a very difficult adjustment. But the West meant something to lots of fans outside of Evanston too. Since the division’s first year in 2014 rivalries have deepened late-season drama has been prevalent and fans have grown to appreciate competing to be the best of the West. While the East has always had more talented traditional powerhouses of the Big Ten the West carved out a role for itself in college football. It was where you went to watch some hard-nosed tough young football players working their butts off. The Minnesota Golden Gophers gave us a consistently frisky ground-and-pound team. The Nebraska Cornhuskers gave us the flukiest August win ever in a foreign country. The Wisconsin Badgers gave Big Ten West fans some hope that it could be a team from our side to emerge victorious in the Championship.  The Iowa Hawkeyes were the other dominant force of the West — if you can really call any of these teams one. They put on display the best defense any football fan can ever remember watching. but they could rarely score points. The Purdue Boilermakers gave Northwestern fans a nice little winnable game (until recent years) on the schedule. Illinois was also in the west but there’s not much to say about them. I suppose they gave us a team to hate above all others and lately some serious Thanksgiving break pain. But that was the beauty of the Big Ten West. One weekend would feature a painful loss and the next would have a bounce-back upset that turned the whole season on its head. The Big Ten itself may feature more high-level talent and more high-profile matchups next year but you heard it here first it’s gonna miss the allure of the Big Ten West. Nothing will be the same when many of the teams I just listed if not all of them are uncompetitive.  So let’s remember the Big Ten West and all that it meant to Midwest sports fans everywhere. There was nothing else like it and there never will be. As we ride out the final season of its existence the legacy of the West will live on in all the fans who were glued to their TVs every Saturday. Its rivalries its intensity and its impact will endure. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story With the weather beginning to turn cooler and speckles of red and orange sparkling at the tops of trees one thing is clear: we’re closing in on the start of men’s basketball season. Here at InsideNU we’ll be previewing every player on the squad and what to expect from them this season. Today we’ll turn our attention to Luke Hunger.  Who is he?  Sophomore; forward; 6-foot-10; 255 pounds; from Montreal Québec; No. 4 ranked Canadian prospect in his class per 247Sports. Career Stats  6.5 minutes per game; 2.7 points per game; 1.3 rebounds; 0.2 assists; 42.9 FG%; 50.0 3PT%; 60.0 FT%. 2022-2023 review  Hunger’s freshman campaign did not go as planned. The Canadian big man sustained a season-ending foot injury during Northwestern’s mid-December win over UIC. The rising sophomore was forced into a walking boot and was seen cheering Northwestern’s magical run from the bench.  However No. 33 contributed in his six games scoring his first two collegiate points on a two-hand slam against Chicago State. Hunger flashed against DePaul finishing with a career-high eight points and three boards. Permission to get our first              of the season out there @NUMensBball? @luke_hunger x @NU_Sports pic.twitter.com/CEQ3ZRnOnC Strengths  Hunger’s biggest strength is his ability to stretch the defense out. Northwestern’s bigs in Matthew Nicholson and Liberty transfer Blake Preston are best within three feet of the basket using their physicality and rim-running to make an offensive impact but give the ‘Cats little in the shooting department. For Hunger his ability to shoot the three-ball allows Chris Collins to use him as a stretch four or as a center in a small-ball lineup. His versatility and range from behind the arc will boost a Northwestern team that finished last season 12th in the Big Ten in three-point shooting percentage.  Furthermore Hunger has the handles to put the ball on the floor and attack the rim. For a player his size he’s effective in getting to the rack and finishing with two hands. The ‘Cats will utilize him off screens too whether in the pick-and-pop or pick-and-roll game working to take some of the scoring load off the guards. Defensively having him in the lineup will give the ‘Cats an extra big in their rotation keeping legs fresh in NU’s high-energy defense. Weaknesses  Inexperience on the court is Hunger’s biggest weakness. Although he certainly learned a lot during Northwestern’s March Madness run watching from the bench is different from living it on the court. Especially with matchups against the Big Ten’s best the untested Hunger will be thrown into the fire. At 6-foot-10 he has the size to match up with a majority of the conference’s bigs; however against physical players like Zach Edey Cliff Omoruyi or Dain Dainja Hunger’s inexperience may present a challenge defensively and on the glass.  Plus coming off a season-ending injury and trying to fight back to midseason form will be difficult. Hunger has seen limited action and doesn’t know the full grind of playing every game of a Big Ten schedule. The Canadian’s mentality will be crucial to his success something he’s primed to find this season. Expectations Poised to be thrust into a meaningful role Hunger projects to be a rotational big man for the Wildcats with offensive upside that could earn him additional minutes. With Nicholson in command of the starting center spot Hunger will compete primarily with Preston for minutes. If he’s able to stay healthy expect the sophomore to give Chris Collins versatility in his lineups as he plays chess against the Big Ten’s grandmasters. At his size Hunger has the potential to be a matchup nightmare from behind the arc pulling away rim protectors from the paint and allowing Northwestern to attack inside.  Add in his ability to score the basketball and Hunger should see a healthy dose of usage playing behind Nicholson. As long as the Canadian sophomore can keep up defensively he should see plenty of the floor for the ‘Cats this winter. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Time to dive into swimming season. Northwestern’s men’s and women’s swimming and divining teams traveled to Ohio for a Friday night dual meet matchup against Cincinnati and then a Saturday morning meet versus Miami (OH). While the men excelled beating Cincinnati 169-93 and then dominating Miami 204-96 the women were defeated by Cincinnati 163-99 but bounced back to beat Miami 161.5-137.5. These meets marked Northwestern’s first competitions under head coach Rachel Stratton-Mills.  NU’s times from the Miami meet were generally faster than those at the Cincinnati meet; however it’s worth noting the team was wearing racing suits in the former meet but practice suits in the latter meet. Full results for both meets can be found on the app MeetMobile. Fifth-year Ayla Spitz and sophomore Hana Shimizu-Bowers were the two Wildcat event winners against Cincinnati. Spitz took home the 100 backstroke 200 backstroke and 200 individual medley and Shimizu-Bowers taking the 200 butterfly and 500 freestyle. The 500 free race came down to the wire—Shmizu-Bowers knocked off Cincinnati’s Libby Michel by just 0.01 of a second to win. However Northwestern was completely out-matched by Cincinnati throughout the meet. The Bearcats didn’t just score off of event wins but they also had significantly more depth.  UC made up at least three out of the five points-scorers in 10 out of 14 individual events (in dual meets the top five finishers in each individual event earn points) finished in first and second in three individual events and put on a clinic in the 1000 free where they were responsible for the top four finishers. It also didn’t help that Cincinnati won both relays which are worth more points than individual wins. ""There were some races that could have gone in Northwestern’s favor if they just swam a few tenths faster such as the 50 100 and 200 free events. In the 50 and 100 free Wildcat sophomore Linsday Ervin finished second to Cincinnatis Jessica Davis twice by 0.37 seconds in the 50 and then by 0.11 seconds (ouch) in the 100. In the 200 NU freshman Sydney Smith had been leading for the first 150 yards of the race but Davis ran her down on the final lap to out-touch her by 0.63 seconds."" ""Had those sprint freestyle races gone in Northwestern’s favor Cincinattis margin of victory would have decreased by a whole 30 points; however that still is far from what it would have taken to flip the final result."" The ‘Cats performed better on Saturday but the Redhawks gave them a scare early on in the meet. To kick things off Miami beat Northwestern in the 400-medley relay by over a second powered by a speedy 47.97 freestyle leg from All-American Nicole Maier. Then the Redhawks won four of the next six events and were leading the Wildcats headed into the first diving break. The two events that Northwestern won during this stretch of the meet were the 1000 free and 100 breast with Shmizu-Bowers taking the former event and freshman Maggie Papanicholas taking the latter. Putting Shmizu-Bowers arguably the team’s top distance swimmer in the 1000 was a smart choice by the coaching staff as the Wildcats were able to avert the scoring disaster that happened in the same event against Cincinnati. NU then went on a six-event win streak putting itself in the lead. Fifth-year Markie Hopkins swept the diving events Spitz took the 500 free and Paponicholas won the 200 breast. The 200 back was Northwestern’s best event of the night as the Wildcats swept the podium. Junior Justine Murdock who finished fifth in the same event against Cincinnati swam six seconds faster than she did the night before to win the 200 back. Ervin also finally got a victory after losing two close matchups against Cincinnati taking the 100 free by over a second and being the only woman in the field under 50 seconds. Miami’s Maier picked up her third win of the night in the 400 IM but NU closed things off with a bang by winning the 200 free relay finishing the weekend even at 1-1. On the men’s side Northwestern took care of Cincinnati handily winning all but two of the 16 contested events and sweeping both relays. Junior Tyler Lu led the charge by winning three events touching the wall first in the 100 back 200 back and 200 IM. Freshmen Diego Nosack and Cade Duncan both took two events apiece with Nosack winning the 200 fly and 500 free and Duncan winning the 50 and 100 free. Duncan SwimSwam.com’s #18-ranked recruit in the high school class of 2023 posted some promising times in the sprint events. His 20.39 50 free was faster than the times of all but one Northwestern swimmer (senior Collin Schuster) at the Big Ten Championships last season which is impressive considering that he posted the time in mid-October in a practice suit. In addition his 44.33 100 free from leading off the 400 free relay was faster than any other returning swimmer’s 2022-23 season-best. Other event winners included fifth-year Kevin Houseman in the 100 breast fifth-year Andrew Martin in the 1000 free and fifth-year Jan Karolczak in the 200 free. Against Miami the Northwestern men performed even better than they did against the Bearcats. They claimed victory in all but three events won both contested relays and held the Redhawks to double-digit points. At this meet Northwestern made a major impact putting up two performances that ranked top ten nationally. The first one came from Martin who took nearly eight seconds off his personal best time in the 1000 free to clock a time of 9:04.24 which ranks him fifth in the NCAA right now. Though the 1000 free isn’t raced at championship meets his performance bodes well for his 1650 free ability come time for Big Ten competition. Martin a graduate transfer from Xavier will look to boost Northwestern men’s distance swimming which has been weak even since team record holder and Olympian Jordan Wilimovsky graduated back in 2017. The second top-ten performance was via Houseman who clocked a 53.42 in the 100 breast to make himself the sixth-fastest performer in the nation for the event. Houseman also won the 200 breast posting his fastest time in the event (1:56.80) since setting his personal best back in February 2022. Other event winners included freshman David Gerchik (100 back 200 back) sophomore Tona Zinn (200 fly) fifth-year Ben Forbes (500 free) Nosack (400 IM) and Karolczak (200 back). In the 100 back 200 back 200 breast and 400 IM Northwestern produced the top three finishers. It’s never good to draw immediate conclusions from the first competition of the season but Northwestern’s opening weekend taught us a lot about both swim teams.  We got to see just how much losing nearly all of their NCAA qualifiers last season hurt the Northwestern women as they went from a top 25 team two seasons ago to a team that faced an uphill climb against a mid-major program and lost badly to another program that had been a mid-major up until this season. I’m not ruling out the potential of the ‘Cats bouncing back to have a great postseason and they certainly are capable of swimming faster than they did last weekend but their early performances have me worried about how they will fare against considerably better programs—such as No. 3 Louisville at the Purdue Invite next month and No. 12 Wisconsin at a dual meet in January. ""On the other hand it was nice to see the mens team get some momentum rolling after how much they struggled last season. The highly-anticipated freshman class performed very well as Duncan Nosack and Gerchik all won events on opening weekend. Obviously we can’t fully evaluate how much the freshmen lived up to their hype until we see them perform at bigger meets like Big Tens and the NCAA Championships but this is a good start."" Next up the Wildcats will have their home opener on Oct. 21 where they will take on Southern Illinois and Miami (FL) in a tri-meet.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This week in its matchups against conference opponents Maryland and Minnesota we continued to see those positives. Julia Sangiacomo and Alexa Rousseau continued to shine and the ‘Cats repeatedly demonstrated how gritty of a team they can be. After dominating the last few sets to take their first game of the weekend against Maryland Northwestern fell in heartbreaking fashion to Minnesota. With this weekend’s results they stay at the .500 mark on the season and move to 3-5 in conference play.  On a dark and stormy Friday the thirteenth Northwestern took on Maryland in hopes of warding off any ‘bad luck’ and earning their first home conference win of the season. Over 1300 fans filed into Welsh-Ryan Arena escaping the rain to cheer on their ‘Cats.  It wasn’t long into the match before the bad luck struck Northwestern. A successful Maryland challenge on the first play of the game gave the Terps an early advantage and momentum. In the blink of an eye the Terps were up 5-0. Graduate Student Julia Sangiacomo finally got Northwestern on the board but the first set struggles would continue. Errors and aces plagued the ‘Cats and they dropped the first set — never bringing the deficit within two points.  Set two was more competitive right off the bat. The ‘Cats and Terps were seemingly trading kills and at 8-7 Northwestern claimed its first lead of the evening thanks to a Samantha Schnitta attack error. While nice for a brief moment the lead didn’t last long.  Maryland was quick to retaliate quickly jumping out to their biggest lead of the set 13-10. Aiming to disrupt the Terrapin momentum Northwestern head coach Shane Davis called a timeout.  It was a crucial moment in the game for Northwestern. The second set — and possibly the game — was slipping from their grasp. This season the Wildcats have only one win in which they were down two sets to none — their shocking upset of No. 17 Purdue on October 1. Coming out of the timeout Northwestern desperately needed some big plays.  Luckily for the ‘Cats Sangiacomo loves to make big plays. She provided Northwestern just the spark it needed – a powerful kill and a big block propelled Northwestern to a 5-0 run. After going back and forth for a few more points the ‘Cats went on another 5-0 run putting them at 25 points and securing a second set victory.  In sets three and four Sangiacomo took over. Her powerful attack changed the complexion of the game as her teammates repeatedly gave her opportunities to shine. By the end of the game almost 40% of Northwestern’s total attempts were from Sangiacomo. She finished the evening with an astounding 27 kills. Even better was that Sangiacomo’s success opened up the floor for her teammates. Alexa Rousseau who finished the game with a whopping 42 assists skillfully deceived Maryland opponents on a number of plays getting points to fall.  Powered by Sangiacomo and Rousseau Northwestern dominated the last two sets. Their strong offensive attack paid dividends on defense as Maryland’s hit percentage dipped below .100 for both the third and fourth sets. After shaking some early misfortunes Northwestern hoped to ride the momentum of their home win to Minnesota where they would take on the Golden Gophers.  The Minnesota Golden Gophers have had quite the frustrating season. Opening the 2023 campaign as No. 7 in the AVCA rankings they have faced one of the most difficult schedules in the country. Over half of the Golden Gophers’ games this season have been against ranked opponents and each of their first six losses were to top-25 teams. After two consecutive losses on the road to unranked opponents — Maryland and Rutgers — the Gophers slid to No. 24 in the AVCA poll. They finally notched a win over Michigan on Wednesday — a huge relief heading into a three-game homestand in which they would host Northwestern.  Facing another unranked opponent a loss to Northwestern would put Minnesota at risk of falling outside the top 25 for the first time since 2015. For the ‘Cats a win against an in-conference power program would certainly help their case for a potential NCAA tournament berth. In last year’s matchup between these squads Northwestern pulled off the shocking upset — beating Minnesota on the road for the first time since 2005. Sunday afternoon the Wildcats looked to make it two straight wins in Minneapolis.  The match began as a back-and-forth affair and in the early stages of the first set the ‘Cats were locked up with the Gophers at five points apiece. It wasn’t long before Minnesota adjusted its game plan. Minnesota tried to neutralize Northwestern’s leading scorer in Sangiacomo taking full advantage whenever she rotated to the back line. Unable to rely on their superstar the ‘Cats were out of sorts making nine errors in the set. After a pair of Minnesota 5-0 runs the Gophers had won the first set handedly 25-14.  After another string of errors Northwestern found itself down again in the second set 10-14. It was reminiscent of the first and there was a sense that Minnesota would soon take control and put the set out of hand. Instead it was just the opposite — the ‘Cats roared back. As if they had simply flicked a switch they were suddenly firing on all cylinders. With Sangiacomo serving Northwestern went on a magnificent 14-point run. Sangiacomo delivered three service aces Leilani Dodson had a ferocious block and in an instant Minnesota was now all out of sorts. Northwestern’s excellent second set was capped off with Rousseau’s signature crafty left-handed swing. It was 1-1 and Northwestern had all of the momentum.  The ‘Cats were rollin’ but Minnesota was serving to start the third set with the chance to disrupt their roll. The Gophers sent Kylie Murr behind the line to serve and she got the job done leading Minnesota to a 5-0 run. The Gophers continued to build on their momentum jumping out to an early 9-1 lead.  As they have all year the ‘Cats fought. They scrapped their way back within four points and they quickly found their rhythm from set two. Kathryn Randorf’s kill off the bench got things going and soon after it was Sangiacomo taking over with four consecutive kills of her own. Northwestern scored eight times consecutively giving them a three-point lead in the set. The ‘Cats and Gophers battled it out for a few more minutes and it was eventually another bench player Lauren Carter with the service ace to clinch the third set at 27-25. After dropping the first set the ‘Cats stormed back to take the next two — just as they had against Maryland. In the fourth set it was time for Northwestern to try and put Minnesota away.  The fourth set began just the way Northwestern wanted. With stellar diving digs from libero Ellee Stinson NU survived some strong swings from Minnesota and got out in front 13-10. With momentum on their side and just 12 points away from securing victory the Wildcats began to fall apart. Northwestern let the Gophers crawl back into the game as a few Northwestern errors powered a 5-0 Minnesota run. Minnesota ultimately took the set on a gorgeously placed hit from Lydia Grote initially called out-of-bounds but overruled upon further review.  In the decisive fifth set Minnesota would revert to a strategy that was proven successful in the early going — subduing Sangiacomo’s ability to attack. They repeatedly targeted her on the first hit forcing her to pass. The Gophers’ top players began to shine when it mattered most. Grote accounted for five points in the set including two service aces and the defending Big Ten player of the year Taylor Landfair had herself two kills and a block. The ‘Cats kept it close but consecutive errors with the game on the line proved to be the final blow. Minnesota took the fifth set 15-12 and clinched a hard-fought victory against a gritty Northwestern squad.  While there are plenty of positive takeaways from Northwestern’s battle in Minneapolis the ‘Cats’ loss to Minnesota is certainly a frustrating one. Northwestern had opportunities to put the game away but instead allowed Minnesota to force a fifth set and ride that momentum to a win. Regardless the ‘Cats showed that they can compete with a Big Ten powerhouse — something they’ll have to do when No. 2 Nebraska currently undefeated at 15-0 comes to Welsh-Ryan Arena for their next game on Wednesday.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Big Ten East has officially become the three team race everyone expected at the start of the season. For the Big Ten West a similar scenario has broken out where the two teams most pegged as the front-runners before the season began are the only two left in relative contention. This has left the bottom of the conference in utter disarray with upsets and comebacks shaking up the standings as teams jockey for position below the respective division leaders. All that and more on this week’s edition of Around the Big Ten. Big Ten East Race This week we are going to focus on the big three of the Big Ten East after one team that shall not be named outed themselves as pretenders this weekend. The trio of Michigan Ohio State and Penn State remain unbeaten in Big Ten play with Michigan sitting at 4-0 and the other two teams sitting at 3-0. Michigan remained perfect by beating Indiana 52-7 in Ann Arbor while their rivals to the south the Buckeyes kept pace by beating Purdue 41-7 in West Lafayette. As all this was going on Penn State was wrapping up their non-conference slate at home against *checks notes* UMass. The Nittany Lions won 63-0. I know that was a lot of information but the point is that the puzzle that is the Big Ten East is still very much unsolved. That will not be the case for long however as the first piece will be put into place this upcoming weekend when Penn State travels to Columbus to take on the Buckeyes in a top-10 matchup. You can count on that one being the centerpiece of this segment this time next week. Big Ten West Race The term “race” perhaps is not the most fitting when discussing America’s favorite college football division but alas here we are. Whatever word you want to use to describe it the winner of this division will be one of two teams Iowa or Wisconsin. The Hawkeyes took the first step towards the division title this past weekend beating the Badgers 15-6 on the road in Madison. They did so despite quarterback Deacon Hill once again completing less than 50% of his passes finishing 6-of-14 for 37 yards. Once again Iowa won with a dominant defense and a potent rushing attack paving the way. With the result Iowa is in the driver’s seat to become the Big Ten West champions and while Wisconsin is not out of it quite yet a comeback will not come easy. The Badgers still have a game against Ohio State remaining and the tiebreaker now belongs to the Hawkeyes. To make matters worse quarterback Tanner Mordecai is now expected to be out for the immediate future with a broken hand. For Iowa the schedule the rest of the way is not exactly a murderer’s row with the next four games coming at home against Minnesota Northwestern Rutgers and Illinois. The Hawkeyes go on to finish the year with a road game at Nebraska. Don’t look now but an 11-1 record is not completely out of the cards for the Hawkeyes. Piscata-wayward football leads to a crucial home win for the Scarlet Knights Let’s not kick anybody while they’re down. Instead let’s shine a light on this Rutgers team who used a wacky fourth quarter to score a 27-24 win over Michigan State on Saturday. The win in which the Scarlet Knights scored 21 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to finish the game leaves them with a 5-2 record overall and a 2-2 record in conference play. The win was well-earned too. They recovered three Spartan fumbles and allowed the opposition to gain just 245 yards of total offense. The Scarlet Knights were also able to overcome two interceptions from quarterback Gavin Wimsatt and a fumble on a kickoff return to come out with the victory. The win was a critical one for Rutgers as it looks to reach bowl eligibility especially considering the rigor of the upcoming schedule. There is a winnable game next weekend on the road at Indiana but the Scarlet Knights finish with games against Ohio State Iowa Penn State and Maryland to close out their schedule. That will prove difficult to navigate for Rutgers but for now a bowl game is well within sight for the Scarlet Knights.

Share this story When watching a defense play most fans’ attention goes to pass-rushers bending around the edge to pursue the quarterback linebackers roaming from sideline to sideline and cornerbacks tasked with mirroring track-speed receivers down the field. But one of the biggest X-factors in determining the course of a game very well may be a slot cornerback. Whether through bone-crushing hits impressive open-field tackles or sound coverage Northwestern’s Rod Heard II has proven his mettle over the course of his Wildcat career. In the last two years Heard has been a do-it-all player for NU having played 1127 snaps and posting 66 tackles two sacks six tackles for loss an interception two forced fumbles and four pass breakups. Now in his redshirt senior season Heard has posted the highest Pro Football Focus grade (71.5) not just of his career but also among Wildcat defenders. He credits experience and learning an appropriate play speed as a catalyst for growth. “I think I’ve just been able to become just way more comfortable out there” Heard said after Tuesday’s practice. “When you’re younger the game is a little bit faster. But so far this season it’s been pretty slow. I’ve been able to just play with a different level of level-headedness and be able to be as efficient as possible.” Ironically enough the job of a slot cornerback may be anything but lax. Such players are responsible to make decisions in milliseconds and carry a myriad of feathers in their caps from helping in run support to blitzing to following shifty receivers; specifically Heard noted that he especially relishes locking down players in coverage. Altogether Heard feels strongly that those at his position are imperative to defenses. “It’s a niche position. Not a lot of people are able to have all of those skillsets in one player” Heard said. “There’s a lot of guys that can cover or they’re mainly run-stoppers but having a player that can do everything and being able to move them around. I think it’s an invaluable player to have on a defense.” Heard has certainly been assigned a multitude of roles in David Braun’s new scheme despite a more constrained on-field alignment. This year 73.8% of Heard’s snaps have come in the slot; last year the Michigan native saw 46.8% of snaps inside and 41.7% come in the box per Pro Football Focus. That adjustment is one that extends from Braun “being able to get guys in positions to make plays” as the DB posited. “There’s definitely some transfer some carryover from some previous defenses but I think he’s done a great job at incorporating all the things that we already were doing here and pretty successful at” Heard said. “And then [Braun] incorporated his new style of defense which got more eyes on the ball and allows players to play more free and more aggressive.” Although Braun began the 2023 calendar year as the Wildcats’ defensive coordinator his role has magnified enormously after his transition to interim head coach on July 10. Having now played under Braun as a head coach for six games Heard praised Braun and his leadership style. “I think he’s done a great job at navigating that transition” Heard said. “Being a players’ coach; making sure that everything he does is for the best interests of the players and our overall team success. I think as a leader he’s been able to galvanize the team and to propel us through his speeches and some of the different challenges he gives us — to make us better players and better people and be in the right space in order to go out there on Saturdays and be the team that we want to be.” In addition to being under the guidance of a new DC Heard is most closely overseen by newcomer LaMarcus Hicks in his first year as NU’s cornerbacks coach. The redshirt senior noted impactful physical and mental communication from Hicks noting he’s “brought great energy to the program.”  “I think he’s done a great job with the corners” Heard remarked. “Bringing in some technique. Being able to translate the different techniques and the mentality — the mindset — that you have to have playing corner.” Thus far Northwestern’s defense is surrendering 27.3 points per game which ranks 11th in the Big Ten and is an improvement of just one point relative to 2022. Part of continued defensive struggles is an inability to collect takeaways: the ‘Cats have just three forced turnovers on D and all were against the UTEP Miners on Sept. 9. Heard stressed that despite some missed opportunities so far in 2023 he and his teammates understand the significance of returning the ball to NU’s offense. “Having takeaways is key to our success moving forward” Heard said. “For practice having an extreme focus on making those plays. This practice we had four interceptions. Being able to replicate how it’s supposed to look in the game in practice is key. “Every single series we go out there we talk about punching at the ball and finding ways to get the ball out. Keeping that a main focus and always trying to grow in that aspect. We’ve got to manifest that on the field but it’s going to happen.” Now in his fifth season in Evanston the remaining six games on Northwestern’s schedule may be the final in the career of Heard in purple and white. The cornerback hopes to demonstrate to NFL personnel not only his development but also his versatility on a down-to-down basis. “I just want to prove my ability to do all of the things that I already do at a high level and being consistent at it” Heard reflected. “During my time in this program I’ve grown a lot; I’ve changed positions. Being able to take everything that I’ve learned even just from the players that I played with previously. Using that to have the best performance that I can. That’s mainly just what I want to prove — that I am an NFL-level player and that I can dominate in all aspects of my game.” \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Northwestern Lacrosse traveled to Sparks Maryland for the USA Lacrosse Fall Classic where it took on the Canadian and USA U-20 women’s national training teams in pouring rain last Saturday. While the defending NCAA champions beat Canada 16-7 they lost to Team USA 13-12. Team USA was led by Northwestern head coach Kelly Amonte-Hiller while her husband Northwestern assistant Scott Hiller headed the Wildcats. In addition Northwestern sophomores Madison Taylor and Francesca Argentieri and freshman Madison Smith were playing on Team USA. Though these Fall Classic games were just scrimmages they still gave fans an early look at what the 2023-24 Northwestern squad could look like as well as which U-20 players will stand out next spring. The two matchups adhered to World Lacrosse rules and not NCAA rules so there were a few notable changes in play such as the absence of a shot clock and 11-meter free position shots rather than eight-meter ones. It could have been the rain the fatigue after the Canada game or the fact that their own head coach was actively plotting against them but the Wildcats were outmatched in momentum by Team USA for most of the game. UNC freshman Chloe Humphrey InsideLacrosse.com’s No. 1 recruit for the Class of 2023 was a pivotal part of Team USA’s success tallying five goals and an assist. Taylor also put up a great performance scoring a hat trick against her own college team. For Northwestern sixth-year Izzy Scane and fifth-year Dylan Amonte led the way with four goals apiece while junior Samantha Smith put up three. Fifth-year Erin Coykendall also nabbed three assists before coming off the field early in the fourth quarter due to an injury when fouled by Team USA’s Lydia Colasante a freshman at Boston College. Northwestern won the first draw but a turnover gave Team USA an offensive opportunity and Humphrey scored unassisted less than a minute in. Scane fired back with an unassisted goal of her own two minutes later but it was clear from the get-go that Team USA was in control of the first quarter. It outscored the Wildcats 5-2 out-shot them 11-2 and it seemed to run just straight through Northwestern’s defense. Smith did score for NU when it was a player up but the Wildcats’ momentum was killed just ten seconds later when BC sophomore Shea Baker tallied another goal for Team USA. A post shared by U.S. Women’s National Team (@usa_wlax) The second quarter was a whole other story. Scane and Amonte alone put up six unanswered goals for the ‘Cats giving their team an 8-5 lead at the half. Amonte scored early and then eight minutes later Coykendall capitalized on a rare moment where Scane was open (she was double or triple-teamed for the majority of the game) passing the ball to the Tewaaraton winner for another goal. Scane’s next goal was arguably her most impressive of the game as she beat Team USA’s Eliza Osburn (a 2024 UNC commit) in a one-on-one to find the back of the net. Izzy’s back ‼️The reigning @Tewaaraton winner looking unstoppable as ever with a first half hat trick vs. @USAWLax. @izzyscane27 | @NULax pic.twitter.com/SRDyA5K3RY Next Amonte scored three consecutive goals within a span of a minute and 47 seconds. Her third goal was assisted by fifth-year Mary Schumar a grad transfer from Marquette who tallied her first points in a Northwestern uniform. Overall Northwestern dominated possession in the second quarter. The closest Team USA came to scoring was with around nine minutes left in the quarter when JMU freshman Madison Epke’s attempt was thwarted by Northwestern’s sixth-year goalie Molly Laliberty. After halftime Team USA came back outscoring the Wildcats 5-1 and outshooting them 9-3. UVA freshman Kate Denmark forced a turnover on Coykendall immediately after Northwestern’s draw control which led to Humphrey finding the back of the net again. Humphrey was in action just two minutes later assisting an Epke goal. Northwestern junior Emerson Bohlig scored the Wildcats’ only goal of the third quarter afterward but it was followed by two more Team USA goals from Humphrey and another from Taylor. Laliberty made three critical saves in the third quarter (more saves than in any other quarter) to prevent additional bleeding but Team USA still kept on shooting and scoring to finish the quarter with a 10-9 lead. Both teams scored three goals in the fourth quarter but Northwestern underperformed in several key moments. Smith scored on the Wildcats’ first possession (which is also when Coykendall went down) to tie the game but Northwestern’s next two shots were saved by Argentieri. The Wildcats then proceeded to lose the ball twice with the second time leading to Humphrey scoring again to put Team USA ahead. Put the word out that CHLOE HUMPHREY IS HER.   pic.twitter.com/nEvEoukz1x Northwestern got its lead back after goals from Smith and Scane and had been leading with three minutes left but Colasante intercepted a pass from NU sophomore Claire Snyder and helped bring the ball down to the other side of the field for Team USA to tie things up. During the next play Epke forced the ball out of Smith’s stick to give Team USA possession and a yellow card given to Northwestern senior Kendall Halpern allowed Team USA to score the game-winning goal off a free-position with a player up. Team USA earned the final draw control of the game hindering all hopes of a Northwestern comeback. Statistically Northwestern and Team USA were relatively even. Team USA outnumbered Northwestern in shots (29-26) ground balls (15-12) and caused turnovers (15-12) but NU was slightly better on the draw (15-14). In goal Laliberty made eight saves led Northwestern with six ground balls and also had one caused turnover. Boston College sophomore Shea Dolce was in goal for Team USA in the first half while Argentieri played in the second half. Argentieri saved an impressive four out of eight shots on goal which is good news for the Wildcats down the road. Northwestern has a lot of things to improve on from this game but it shouldn’t be a cause for too much concern. It’s still very early on in the year and the season doesn’t start for another four months so the team will have plenty of time to clean up. Plus it doesn’t hurt that the Wildcats will get their actual head coach and several of its players back for the real games. However NU should take note of the several young stars that excelled on Saturday (Humphrey and Epke to name a few) as they will be threats come spring. This match against Canada which ended approximately 90 minutes before the start of the Team USA game was a lot more lopsided. The Wildcats were playing a team that had lost to Team USA 16-9 the night before and stars like Scane Schumar Amonte and Coykendall didn’t play the majority of the game. In addition Laliberty was benched after 22 minutes in goal (though she still made five saves) for sophomore Cara Nugent. Without the team’s major heavyweights it was senior Hannah Johnson who stepped up for Northwestern recording four goals and an assist. Johnson notably missed the entirety of last season and her comeback this season will be an interesting storyline to follow. Northwestern was tied with Canada 6-6 headed into halftime but then Scane and Coykendall came in during the third quarter to help give Northwestern the lead. They both scored two highlight-reel-worthy goals apiece with one of them being a behind-the-back assist from Coykendall that led to a Scane goal. A post shared by Northwestern Lacrosse (@nu_lax) The Wildcats outscored Canada 10-1 in the second half which was a big part of their 16-7 victory. Bohlig sophomore Lucy Munro and freshman Noel Cumberland all scored two goals. Overall this game was a good opportunity for some of Northwestern’s subs to get some playing time and gain more experience before the season.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story ""With only 15 days before Wildcat men’s basketball touches the floor our anticipation for a sold-out crowd in Welsh Ryan Arena grows by the minute. While we wait lets preview Nick Martinelli who might just be Northwestern’s best lockdown defender off the bench this season. "" Who is he? Sophomore; forward; 6-foot-7; 200 pounds; from Glenview IL Career Stats 9.9 minutes per game; 2.6 points per game; 1.4 rebounds; 0.3 assists; 51.2 FG%; 50.0 3PT%; 50.0 FT% 2022-2023 review In his first season Martinelli made a notable impact. Despite making no starts and missing 14 games altogether he still managed to play 200 minutes — leading the first-years in points and minutes. In a year of many firsts Martinelli recorded his first steal in his collegiate opener against Chicago St.  Just as the season was ramping up No. 2 missed the entirety of December play. After missing ten games in the peak of the ‘Cats’ season — including their 70-63 defeat against No. 20 Michigan St. — Martinelli returned against Wisconsin on Jan. 23 getting a majority of his minutes during conference games. He reached his career-high of 18 minutes in the last two regular-season games. Strengths The expectations for the sophomore are high this season. Don’t be deceived by his minimal scoring. As a defensive player Martinelli could easily become a starter by the end of the season. He’s an energetic defender willing to dive for rebounds offensively and defensively. In just 12 minutes against Minnesota last season Martinelli grabbed five boards — four of which were offensive. At the end of the 2022-23 season the Wildcats finished with the third-best defense in the Big Ten holding their opponents to an average of 62.8 points per game. As long as Martinelli keeps up this eagerness on the defensive side of the ball the Wildcats may find themselves ranked among the Top 20 NCAA defenses. Weaknesses Although Martinelli’s defensive contributions are appreciated seeing improvement in his free throw percentage and field goal attempts per game could also make him a real threat on offense. Northwestern losing its second-leading scorer in Chase Audige will put pressure on scoring for everyone but as a wing with a crafty left hook Martinelli has the potential to open up the paint for more scoring opportunities. Regardless of his 2.6 points per game Martinelli made 21 of 42 shot attempts last season and four of eight from behind the arc. With more minutes and more attempts it’s not unrealistic that the forward’s PPG could take a leap.  Expectations After finishing in the top three of the conference with a 12-8 B10 record all eyes are on Northwestern. Now that Martinelli has experience on the big stage the stakes are high for him. Outside of his size at 6-foot-7 Martinelli’s other advantage in comparison to other sophomores on the team is experience. While no one is expecting the second year to start he should find a new role as a go-to guy off the bench. However if Martinelli’s game lacks improvement his role could easily be replaced by more experienced transfer Blake Preston who averaged four more rebounds and points than Martinelli. In high school Martinelli was a three-star prospect and ranked as the No. 7 player in Illinois by 247Sports after averaging 22.8 points per game in his senior season. Should the forward channel his scoring abilities his ceiling could be far greater than anticipated. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After a week-long hiatus Northwestern football is back and hoping for a second straight win to be above .500 for the first time in three years. But for that to happen a lot needs to go right for head coach David Braun and Co. Northwestern travels to Lincoln to face Nebraska (3-3 overall 1-2 in the Big Ten) which is coming off a big win over Illinois. The two squads are currently tied for third in the Big Ten West making the outcome of this game consequential for the final standings. Given how evenly matched the two teams are the game will likely depend on who can exploit these important matchups.  1. Ben Bryant vs. Nebraska’s secondary Although he remained sidelined for Northwestern’s homecoming game against Howard the bye week should have given the ‘Cats’ QB1 ample time to rest up for Lincoln this Saturday. Bryant has been by far the Wildcats’ most productive quarterback with 926 yards and six touchdowns (good for a 115.9 passer rating). Despite some offensive struggles for the ‘Cats they hope to get back on track with Bryant at the helm as they face a Nebraska defense that is currently allowing the most passing yards per game (247.2) through its six contests. Though NU is throwing for just over 200 yards per game this season a breakout performance against a bottom-tier Big Ten secondary may help the passing game get in a rhythm and be what stands between the Wildcats and their first true away game win since November 2020. 2. NU O-Line vs. Nebraska D-Line It’s a common saying in football that games are often won in the trenches. In this matchup Northwestern’s offensive line faces a prolific Nebraska front seven that is giving up just 75.8 rushing yards per game (second in the Big Ten) and has recorded 16 sacks (sixth). On the other hand Northwestern’s offensive line hasn’t exactly been extraordinary: the Wildcats have the least efficient run game in the Big Ten averaging just 103 yards per game on 3.1 average yards per carry — both qualifying for dead last in the conference.  If NU hopes to see an established run game and consistency from its passing game the biggest improvement can be broken down into four words: time in the pocket. The Northwestern backfield has seen a whole lot of the opposing team this season as Northwestern ranks second-to-last in pressures allowed (78) trailed only by Illinois among conference teams. For Bryant to exploit Nebraska’s defense through the air he will need to rely on the guys meant to protect him who have been lackluster so far. Similarly the matchup between the big bodies on the NU and Nebraska sides will affect if Wildcats stars like Cam Porter and A.J. Henning can make a real impact offensively.  3. Heinrich Haarberg vs. Xander Mueller On the flip side the biggest matchup between the Cornhusker offense and Wildcats defense will be quarterback Heinrich Haarberg and the NU linebacker corps including starting inside linebacker Xander Mueller. While Haarberg has struggled passing-wise this year posting a completion percentage of just 52.1% through five games he has done much of his damage on the ground. He is currently the Cornhuskers’ leading rusher with 352 yards and three touchdowns on 69 total carries. Haarberg being a dual-threat quarterback leaves Northwestern reliant on its linebacking unit and more specifically Mueller. The Wheaton Illinois product has been incredibly important as the QB spy and is a pest in the backfield for opposing offenses. Mueller is the second-highest tackler (41 total tackles) on defense and leads the team in sacks (3.5) but he will be more valuable than ever in this matchup as he will be tasked with containing Haarberg and slowing Nebraska’s offense. The “winner” of this one-on-one is likely to be the ultimate factor in how things play out when the ball is in Nebraska’s hands.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After a week off. Northwestern football sits at 3-3 heading into the second half of the season. The Wildcats kick off the home stretch with a trip to Lincoln to take on Nebraska. As the ‘Cats get ready for a Big Ten West matchup interim head coach David Braun met with the media on Monday afternoon to discuss the bye week and NU’s upcoming matchup with the Cornhuskers. This press conference has been edited for brevity and clarity. Opening Statement:  “Coming off a bye week really proud of the way that our guys handled last week. We invested in some developmental opportunities for our entire roster specifically our guys that haven’t been seen a ton of end game reps which was an incredible opportunity for us as a coaching staff and our players to continue to improve and return to techniques fundamentals and things that we’ll need to continue to lean into as we move forward.  “Ramped up the second half of the week. We invested the entire week last week in Nebraska prep but really got an opportunity as the week wore along to really get into more situational football in our Nebraska prep. Then had an opportunity to have a little bit of downtime over the weekend and hopefully use that to get our bodies back and continue to get as healthy as we can as we as we enter into the second half of the season.  “Certainly excited about the opportunity that’s ahead for us out in Lincoln. Facing a very well-coached football team. A team that certainly is starting to find its rhythm with an adjustment at the quarterback position. Big athletic well-coached QB that is starting to find some rhythm and a defense that’s playing at a really high level so a big challenge for us. Wouldn’t want anything less in Big Ten football and excited for the challenge that’s ahead of us.” On the availability of Ben Bryant A.J. Henning and Jack Lausch: “We anticipate that A.J. will be good to go. He has been practicing as is Jack. Ben continues to progress. Not sure exactly what his status will be come game time but he is progressing. Anticipate that’s something we’ll continue to evaluate as the week goes along.” On how he’s grown as a head coach: “It feels like I’ve grown exponentially simply through having no other choice. Your greatest growth comes in situations of adversity and new trials. Certainly a lot of growth still left but there’s a great group around me and a great locker room of young men. “I really tried to do my best to self-reflect each and every day each and every week on areas that I can continue to improve and excited about where this group is out right now but I also know that there’s a lot of work ahead if we want to achieve the things that we set out to do this season.” On playing at Memorial Stadium: “It all routes back into our practice prep. Even last week we were pumping crowd noise into all of our practices It’s an opportunity for us defensively we don’t anticipate that type of crowd noise when we’re on the field but opportunity for us to root into some of our nonverbal communication getting everybody on the same page and a great opportunity for offense to prepare under the environment that they’re gonna be playing in on Saturday.  “One thing I will say is in my time at North Dakota State I saw in that dome 20000 people right on top of you the impact that can have on an offense. This is certainly at a larger stage with many more fans involved in that process. That’s something that Coach Bajakian Coach Anderson and our offense have done a great job of handling in our early days of prep and we’ll continue to put them in those stressful situations as we move towards Saturday.” On assessing performances during the bye week:  “I don’t know if it’s my job to get myself a grade. What I will say is I took it as an opportunity to evaluate where we’re at in recruiting really excited about where we’re at with this class. The commitments that we’ve held on to and the commitments that we’ve gained here over the course of the last few weeks.  “I took it as an opportunity to really dive into self-scout both offensively and defensively and identify where we have some tendencies and some things that we need to view ourselves how our opponents are viewing us. Took an opportunity to spend quality time with our players over the course of the week and just check in and continue to develop our youth.  “I know there’s a lot of room left for my own personal growth just as there is for our entire football team. That’s what’s so neat about a bye week: you get to take a deep breath look at yourself in the mirror take full ownership of where you’re at and set the course for how we’re going to move forward.” On Stopping Heinrich Haarberg on the ground: “You’ve got to play with great leverage and you got to tackle. I know that’s oversimplified but when you don’t do that he has the ability to be extremely explosive. He has the ability to run through arm tackles. and when you lose leverage he’ll turn it into a touchdown on you. I’ve been really impressed with his ability to operate within the scheme and within the system. You talk about plus-one football — when he’s carrying the ball you better use every hat you got.” On playing mobile quarterbacks previously helps prepare for Nebraska: “I think it does. I think there are some things that we look back on I look back on specifically in terms of the way that the game was called. From a defensive coordinator standpoint from my standpoint I wish I had some calls back.  “So you take that information and you move forward accordingly. There is nothing more scary to a defensive play-caller than a young man that operates the offense at a high level has the ability to be utilized in plus-one run game and has the ability to extend plays and take off with his feet once things breakdown in the passing game. To Nebraska’s credit they’ve they’ve really started to find a rhythm there.” On Richie Hagarty’s availability:  “We anticipate that Richie will play.” On his confidence in the D-Line against UNL:  “When we’ve been at our best defensively this year we’ve controlled the line of scrimmage we’ve created knockbacks we’ve been urgent to get off of blocks. When our guys play with that demeanor up front good things happen for us defensively. That’s certainly the expectation has been the expectation and will be the expectation moving forward. I think it’s a great opportunity for our guys to challenge themselves against the Nebraska team that’s certainly going to look to establish the run game. If we’re not able to stop the run it’s gonna be a long day for us.” On staying balanced on offense: “I think it comes down to just creating balance and staying ahead of the sticks. Something I challenged our entire team on is our pre-snap procedure and the things that we can control. Whether that’s defensively all being on the same page or offensively making sure that communication from the sideline to our team to our pre-snap procedure to make sure that everything is perfect before the snap of the football.  “Offensively when we stay ahead of the chains I think naturally some of that balance that we’re all looking for naturally happens.  When you avoid second-and-12 third-and-11 there’s just more balance and it’s more difficult to call a defense in those situations. When that consistently happens you’ll see that. “When you go back and study the Howard film in our drives where we stayed ahead of the chains really good things happened. when we found ways to hurt ourselves through penalties negative plays TFLs or sacks it was hard for us to catch our rhythm.” On closing out games: “I think it really comes down to our level of focus and our level of urgency in everything that we’re doing. It’s easy to say those things: but how are we embodying that in our practice habits how are we embodying that in an immediate environment? How am I embodying that in terms of the way that I carry myself as the head coach whether it be on the sideline at halftime or carrying over into the third and fourth quarter. “You could see it very plainly on Friday with Colorado vs. Stanford. Colorado a very good football team that’s playing at a high level jumps out to a big lead in the first half but isn’t able to close out. It can happen in all areas of college football and I got to continue to challenge myself and our entire team to approach every opportunity whether it be practice meetings or gameday with just a certain level of urgency and focus on all the details.” On the themes of the season so far: “I think it’s been a resilient group. A group that’s continued to pour into one another and care for one another. It’s a group that understands: the people that they’ve worked so hard with over the course of the offseason over the course of the summer over the course of fall camp and over the course of ups and downs along the first half of this season. Those are the people that they need to continue to pour into.  “I’ve really challenged the group entering into the second half. All the goals and aspirations that this group has for themselves the story that they hope to write all that is still right in front of them. Now this is an opportunity as we enter into the second half specifically the third quarter to go set the stage for the things that will be ahead of us in the second half of the season.” On starting the second half of the season: “I think it’s an opportunity for us to reflect back on what we’ve experienced take full ownership of things we need to continue to build off of that have been positive but also challenge ourselves in areas where we need to improve.  “Speaking to some of the questions of evaluating myself what a great opportunity for me to continue to improve on: my clock management my communication with our staff and continuing to hone in on some of the details that need to happen with me calling the defense and being the head coach.  “Same thing for our players. The beauty of it is we get to look back take full ownership of where we’re at and then set the course moving forward. I think you have a group that’s really hungry really excited and eager to attack this week of practice.” On recruiting and picking up commitments: “We talked about telling the story. At the end of the day recruiting is presenting a story and just giving young men and their families thorough information. I think the story that exists here at Northwestern is a really special story to tell. It’s some of the best academics a young man could find a degree that has an opportunity to set a young man up for the rest of his life and playing in the Big Ten. Doing that within incredible facilities surrounded by a bunch of coaches that are going to pour into you in a developmental program I think there’s a story to tell there. “I think what you’re seeing is young men and their families realizing that even though there’s a certain level of uncertainty we’re not going to focus on that. We’re gonna focus on the things that we can continue to commit to at Northwestern and that’s an opportunity to play in the Big Ten and an opportunity to do it at one of the best institutions you can find.” On if he’s spoken to Matt Rhule about leading a program after a scandal: “We haven’t. I have a tremendous amount of respect for Coach Rhule for the way that he built that program up at Baylor. I’ve observed him from afar for a long time. A tremendous amount of respect for the way that he coaches the game mentors young men and knows how to build a program.” On Xander Mueller: “I’ll start by saying I just love the way that that young man approaches practice: the energy he brings every single day there’s a consistency there there’s a focus there. We’ve talked about ownership here multiple times over the course of the last few minutes Xander Mueller is someone that fully embraces and invites coaching. “A lot of that growth that we’ve seen out of Xander is the fact that he’s taken coaching from [Linebackers coach Tim McGarigle]. He’s accepted that he’s invited that he’s taken full ownership on things that he needs to improve on within his game. It’s pretty fun to see that show up in the production we’ve seen out of him this year.” On players getting healthy during the bye week:  “We tried to find a really healthy balance between continuing to push and improve and prepare for Nebraska but also giving our guys ample time to recover and get their bodies back. I really feel like in our planning we were able to accomplish that. It’s pretty exciting to get back to practice today and tomorrow and wrap this thing back up.  “At the end of the day Nebraska specifically defensively has done some incredible things in stressing their opponents. Really excited about the plan that Coach Jake Coach Anderson and the rest of that offensive staff are putting together for our guys.” On adding recruiting to his plate as Interim Head Coach:  “I just leaned in relationships genuine relationships. At the end of the day I’m gonna bust my tail put every fiber of my being into supporting our current players serving our current players and putting them at the forefront of all our decision-making — while also making sure that I’m being a great steward of this program.  “How do you do that you?  You identify young men across the country that you feel fit the profile here at Northwestern that love football that value of a Northwestern degree that you feel like in due time can be developed into great Big Ten football players. Then you tell a story but a story of truth what truly exists here and we’re doing that through genuine relationships. “We’re doing that through telling them the truth of what this looks like moving forward. Clearly you’re starting to see a bunch of young men and their families deem that as something that they want to be a part of moving forward.” On his message to recruits about the uncertainty surrounding the program: “It’s the same thing that my wife and I have committed to and the same thing that we tell our players  control the controllables. Now what do you know: Northwestern offers one of the best degrees somebody can find and we’re playing in the Big Ten. This program has been rooted in the holistic development and mentoring of young men as far as we can remember. I certainly trust that that’s going to be the case moving forward.  “Whoever holds this position as head coach moving forward those are things that you can count on. If young men and their families want to come back with more direct questions for me in terms of my status I just continue to tell them I’m gonna focus on the things I can control. That’s supporting our players serving our players and busting my tail to make sure that we have an opportunity to write the story that we’ve continued to talk about.” \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story If someone asked you to paint a picture of what a bowl-eligible Northwestern football team would like a year ago what would you have constructed?  I couldn’t begin to speculate what’s running through your mind but I can make a few bets. I bet that you wouldn’t have imagined a David Braun-led team certainly not under the conditions in which he ascended to the head coach post. I bet that you wouldn’t have suspected a 21-point comeback against a Big Ten opponent was in the cards. I bet that you wouldn’t have fathomed a formerly 1-11 team who lost multiple talents to the NFL would accumulate more wins in its following season through six weeks. In any case — by many metrics — Northwestern football is outperforming expectations and is on pace to be the beneficiary of regressing Big Ten foes (see: Illinois and Purdue). Coming off its bye week NU sits at .500 a win away from ascending above the depths of a three-year tenure in the red (excluding NU’s 1-0 start last season). In layman’s terms if the ‘Cats manage to upset Nebraska an 11-point favorite the path to a bowl game suddenly isn’t so daunting. But it’s not that easy it never is. Don’t allow a glimpse of optimism to be misconstrued with naivety. I’m still very much aware that NU is coming off a win against an FCS opponent who mounted a near comeback in the fourth quarter and just this past week took a 41-point walloping at the hands of Harvard. Northwestern is no stranger to not capitalizing on momentum if that’s what you can call a three-point win against the Bison. It would shock nobody especially not me if the ‘Cats endure a mid-season collapse. Even though four teams sit below NU in the Big Ten West standings I don’t think anybody would expect Braun’s squad to stomp the more meager teams. Brendan Sullivan was at the helm two Saturdays ago as Ben Bryant continues to deal with a shoulder injury. A.J. Henning was also sidelined. Even without its main cast of characters the ‘Cats’ offense avoided lethargy for a good portion of the contest. Sullivan and Co. put up 14 points in the first half (the other two courtesy of a Xander Mueller safety). The strong start regardless of the lackluster opponent was refreshing given the team’s often splotchy offense. Sullivan drew first blood via a 35-yard scramble that got NU on the board. The legs on the junior quarterback were a welcome addition to the offense. For as good as Ben Bryant has been at times this year there have been plenty of moments where his lack of mobility felt like a free pass for opposing edge rushers to get home. We’ve seen Mike Bajakian utilize Jack Lausch as a pseudo-running back throughout the season but having a dual-threat under center adds a layer to the offense that makes you feel like any down and distance might be overcome. Despite all of this it would’ve been nice to see the unit put up a more dominant showing against a defense that ranks No. 66 in the FCS. Sullivan flailed at times making questionable throws and taking questionable sacks — good for a QBR of…25.8. For reference if that figure were to be Sullivan’s season-long average he’d rank 128th out of 134 FBS quarterbacks. Bryant’s return which Braun has yet to confirm ahead of the Nebraska game should be a source of excitement. Still Sullivan’s contribution against Howard at least forces other teams to game-plan for a mobile QB until they know Bryant is healthy again. On the other side of the ball the defense is a tale of two levels — the defensive front and the rest. The ‘Cats are allowing over 170 yards on the ground through six games which puts them in the lower quartile of rush defenses in the entire FBS. Meanwhile the linebackers and secondary have generally held up their end of the bargain. Mueller and Bryce Gallagher have lived up to the expectations of veteran playmakers and they’ve stepped up in big moments throughout the first half of the year. The secondary led by Rod Heard II ranks No. 5 in the Big Ten. As you can see gaps abound this Northwestern squad. Short-handedness at key positions an offensive line that allows sacks too often for comfort and a defensive front that hardly can penetrate the backfield are reasons for concern. Fresh off a bye week it’s time for all these groups to prove they’re more polished than before — otherwise an extra December contest won’t be in the cards. Despite all of these anxiety-inducing characteristics from a team with a poor track record in big games a win against Nebraska changes the landscape of the season. Suddenly with triumphs over the lesser Boilermakers and Illini the ‘Cats will have tangibly outperformed nearly every expectation placed on them in the summer. All of NU’s lofty hopes hinge on surprising pundits once again following its bye week. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After riding the high of taking down No. 3 Iowa Northwestern shot up to a No. 1 ranking. It followed up the vote of confidence with an easy take down of Ohio 5-0 on its Senior Day. To a certain extent it’s almost unfair how good Northwestern field hockey is. The Wildcats’ fifth straight shutout — 10th of the season — brought them to 13 consecutive wins.  The first half as was the case for most of the game was all Northwestern. The Bobcats never even had the chance to fire a shot in the opening quarter and only were able to tally one by the half. The Wildcats meanwhile shot five attempts in both frames and carried a 2-0 lead into the break.  After missing opportunities on two shots and a penalty corner Lindsey Frank and Peyton Halsey broke through to put Northwestern on the board a little over five minutes into play. Frank the two-sport graduate transfer from Richmond dribbled the ball all the way down the sideline and to the goal before shooting a short pass forward to Halsey who found the backboards. The graduate student’s 10th goal of the season kept her in the lead for goals on the team.  For the first five minutes of the second quarter Northwestern continued to pile on the pressure. Alia Marshall snagged a penalty corner but Ilse Tromp’s shot was blocked. This pattern continued. Marshall got another penalty but this time Lane Herbert and Lauren Wadas could not convert the ball. Then Chloe Relford got the third penalty which led to a blocked shot from Herbert. First-year Olivia Bent-Cole was right there waiting firing the second goal off her third shot of the game. Weekly Reminder: Olivia Bent-Cole is really good at this    pic.twitter.com/1whbH4PsgQ The Wildcats started off the second half of the game just as strong as the first not allowing the Bobcats a shot in the third set and tallying two more goals.  After Marshall got Northwestern a penalty corner — her fourth of the game — she inserted the ball to the top of the circle where Halsey set up Tromp for a clean shot.  Ilse making it look EASY  \u200d  pic.twitter.com/cyIVWtvGXZ 10 minutes later Marshall set up another Wildcat corner but this time Tromp sent the ball down to Bent-Cole who deflected it for her second goal of the game and a 4-0 lead.  The fourth quarter allowed for more Northwestern players to see playing time and gave Ohio a few more opportunities to tack one on the board. Despite five shots and four penalty corners the Bobcats found no success with Annabel Skubisz gathering two saves against their effort. But this frame was all about Wadas.  She opened the quarter with a goal assisted by Marshall and Halsey making for the fourth straight goal off a corner. Then she closed out the quarter with a defensive save in a last-minute corner by Ohio.  The Wildcats severely outmatched the Bobcats in shots and shots on goal 21-6 and 13-2 respectively. Marshall and Halsey each notched two assists as their tandem proved to be lethal for scoring off corners.  The ‘Cats have a difficult Big Ten slate ahead of them as they prepare to face No. 16 Penn State No. 4 Rutgers and No. 9 Maryland to finish out the season.  Northwestern will look to extend its winning streak to 15 as it heads to Pennsylvania on Friday and New Jersey on Sunday.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Week Six was an eventful one for our former Wildcats. Let’s see how the NU alumni made their mark on the NFL during this midseason slate of games. Greg Newsome II: Cleveland Browns CB Newsome II and the Browns shocked the NFL on Sunday handing the previously undefeated 49ers their first loss of the season. Newsome finished with four tackles and a pass breakup disrupting Brock Purdy’s rhythm on a rainy afternoon in Cleveland. Purdy went just 4-for-15 with an interception when targeting the trio of Newsome Denzel Ward and Martin Emerson Jr.  The 2021 first-rounder definitely kept receipts:  pic.twitter.com/DgMy1CP6gp The Browns have the right to stake their claim as the best defense in the NFL at the moment. They’ve allowed just 1002 total yards all season over 550 yards better than the second-place Ravens. Newsome and the Browns’ secondary will next look to lock down Gardner Minshew and the Colts’ offense in Indianapolis. Week Seven matchup: at Indianapolis Colts (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Rashawn Slater: Los Angeles Chargers OT Slater struggled in the Chargers’ 20-17 loss to the Cowboys on Monday night allowing a team-high six pressures and one QB hit. It was an uncharacteristic performance made more concerning by the fact he only matched up against All-Pro linebacker Micah Parsons once all game. Down seven in the fourth quarter an offensive holding call on Slater set up second-and-24 and an eventual punt representing a missed opportunity to score in a crucial moment. Although he didn’t enter the game with an injury designation it’s possible that Slater is still nursing the ankle ailment that limited him in practice several weeks ago. The third-year tackle will face a formidable Kansas City defensive front led by Chris Jones on Sunday afternoon. Week Seven matchup: at Kansas City Chiefs (Sunday 3:25 p.m. CT) Peter Skoronski: Tennessee Titans OG The Titans took a tough 24-16 loss against the Ravens in London but Skoronski looked solid in his second game back from an appendectomy. He finished with a PFF grade of 65.7 which was fourth-highest among Tennessee’s offensive players. Skoronski’s highlight play came in the third quarter when he threw a great block after slipping and getting back up to clear the way for a Derrick Henry rushing TD.  Skoronski finished the contest having given up two pressures but he still hasn’t allowed a sack in three games this season. He and the Titans will use the bye week to prepare for a matchup against the Falcons on Oct. 29. Week Seven matchup: Bye Dean Lowry: Minnesota Vikings DE Lowry had another quiet day in the Vikings’ 19-13 win against the Bears recording two combined tackles but failing to disrupt the quarterback in any way. Minnesota escaped with their second victory of the season but still could look to sell at the trade deadline. Lowry is definitely a candidate to either be traded or cut. Expect Lowry to continue ceding snaps to tackle Khyiris Tonga as his Vikings tenure potentially comes to a close. The Vikings are slated to face the 5-1 49ers on Monday night. Week Seven matchup: vs. San Francisco 49ers (Monday 7:15 p.m. CT) Anthony Walker Jr.: Cleveland Browns LB Walker Jr. made a solo tackle before leaving in the third quarter of the Browns’ upset win with a head injury. He was officially ruled out with a concussion by the end of the game and his status for Cleveland’s game against the Colts is in doubt.  Since being drafted by the Colts as a fifth-round selection in 2017 Walker has notched 318 solo tackles and 25 tackles for loss in 78 career games. He has made his mark on Cleveland’s defense in his second season with the team being named one of five captains. Walker will look to clear protocol in time for a homecoming against his former team. Week Seven matchup: at Indianapolis Colts (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Blake Hance: Jacksonville Jaguars OG Hance saw the field for a season-high 41 offensive snaps in Jacksonville’s decisive 37-20 victory against the Colts. He filled in for right guard Brandon Scherff who exited the game with an ankle injury.  Hance’s PFF grade of 54.9 was fourth-lowest among the Jaguars’ offensive starters but that doesn’t tell the whole story. For the most part he held his own against an Indianapolis interior line spearheaded by All-Pro tackle DeForest Buckner. The Jags have a short week — if Scherff can’t go against the Saints on Thursday night Hance will make his first official start of the season. Week Seven matchup: at New Orleans Saints (Thursday 7:15 p.m. CT) Tyler Lancaster: Denver Broncos NT Lancaster was activated from the Broncos’ practice squad before their 19-8 loss to the Chiefs on Thursday night. He played 13 defensive snaps mainly against the Kansas City run. The nose tackle was able to get on the stat sheet; he assisted on a tackle to bring down Kadarius Toney for a two-yard loss in the third quarter. Undrafted in 2018 Lancaster recorded 101 total tackles and 18.5 tackles for loss in three seasons at NU. The Broncos who are now scuttling at 1-5 could keep him on their active roster as they look for a defensive spark leading up to their matchup against the Packers.

Share this story For the ‘Cats things seem to be heading in the right direction. Northwestern finally broke its almost month-long streak of bad luck on Thursday winning its first game in 25 days against Iowa 2-1. Then came a tie against No. 4 Penn State 2-2. It seems that things are finally on the up-and-up for the ‘Cats who are hopeful for a return to the successes of the season’s beginning. The showdown in Iowa City started with an Emma Phillips masterclass. After an incredible save to keep Iowa’s first score out of the net her set-piece header put Northwestern on the board. Ella Hase rallied in the second half and fired one into the net which made it her 8th so far this year. Meg Boade was on the assist — her 12th of the season — and set a new record for most single-season assists in program history. Speaking of record-breaking the Wildcats kept up the trend against Penn State and went for a season-high 28 shots on goal in 90 minutes. Although they faced a squad down one player after a 24th-minute red card the ‘Cats could not come out on top. The game was a collection of oh-so-close moments epitomized by an early chance from Hase striking the crossbar. NU failed to capitalize on the opportunities it had against the shorthanded Nittany Lions even though Penn State only put up four shots on goal.  These statistics make it seem like Northwestern should have the upper hand against a lot of these teams but NU has a bad habit of outshooting opponents and not coming away with the W. In its 0-2 loss to Michigan Northwestern had 13 shots to the Wolverines’ nine. And in the 2-3 last-minute kicker against Nebraska NU had five more shots on the day.  Hopefully the ‘Cats will be able to use some of that momentum to their advantage instead of letting it go to waste. These promising numbers allude to a team that can get into the attacking third of the field and are able to get past defenders. Now it just seems like Northwestern has to perfect its crosses and fix some of the sloppiness that occurs before taking shots in the box. Despite that it’s clear that this team has what it takes to win games. The ‘Cats sit at 8-4-4 on the season with two wins in the Big Ten; they’ll have two more chances to improve to .500 within the conference as they take on Minnesota on Thursday and Rutgers next week.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story 1. Michigan (7-0 4-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 1 Last Result: 52-7 win vs. Indiana Next: at Michigan State Another week another beat down of a Big Ten opponent by Michigan. This week’s victim was Indiana in a 52-7 laugher. Although the Wolverines started off slow they kicked into high gear in the second quarter. Michigan scored 21 points in the second period 17 in the third and 14 in the fourth out-gaining its opponent in total yardage 407-232. Michigan’s defense also came to play causing four turnovers and only allowing one first quarter touchdown as the lone score of the game for the Hoosiers. Look for Michigan to continue its roll next week at in-state rival Michigan State. 2. Penn State (6-0 3-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 2 Last Result: 63-0 win vs. UMass Next: at Ohio State Penn State started off slow against UMass on Saturday fumbling on its first possession of the game but after two three-and-outs by the Minutemen Penn State returned a punt for a touchdown and scored every single time it touched the ball.  After the punt return the Nittany Lions scored three touchdowns to end the half scored touchdowns on their first two possessions of the second half returned another punt for a touchdown forced an interception scored another two touchdowns and then caused UMass to turn the ball over on downs before they kneeled to end the game. It’s hard to nitpick a 63-0 shutout victory but the Nittany Lions did lose two fumbles and committed six penalties. The real test comes next week when they head into the Horseshoe to face Ohio State. 3. Ohio State (6-0 3-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 3 Last Result: 41-7 win at Purdue Next: vs. Penn State Speaking of those Buckeyes Ohio State had its own fun time at Purdue. Unlike Penn State and Michigan Ohio State started its scoring early with touchdowns on its first two possessions. The Buckeyes were sloppy at times giving up two turnovers committing nine penalties and only averaging 3.9 yards per rush. However quarterbacks Kyle McCord who threw for three touchdowns and Devin Brown who threw for a touchdown and rushed for another as well as running back Dallan Hayden who rushed for a score carried the offense. Ohio State has its toughest test yet this upcoming weekend against an undefeated Penn State team. 4. Iowa (6-1 3-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 5 Last Result: 15-6 win at Wisconsin Next: vs. Minnesota This Iowa defense just doesn’t quit. Although the Hawkeyes gave up 332 yards this game they limited the Badgers to 2-for-17 on third downs and forced two turnovers. Wisconsin may have been able to move the ball into Iowa territory at times but the Hawkeyes held them out of the end zone all afternoon to beat the Badgers in back-to-back years for the first time since 2008-09. The Heartland Trophy stays in Iowa City for another year. How about Iowa running back Leshon Williams carrying the ball 25 times for a whopping 174 yards? His 82-yard touchdown run was the difference maker for a team that entered the day averaging less than 250 total yards per game.  Ranked in the top 25 for the second time this year Kirk Ferentz might mess around and lead his Hawkeyes to their second Big Ten West Division title in three years. 5. Maryland (5-2 2-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 4 Last Result: 27-24 loss vs. Illinois Next: Bye This was a tough back and forth game that resulted in a loss for Maryland. There were four lead changes in this game and just when Maryland felt good kicking a 48-yard field goal to tie the game with 1:31 left Illinois marched down the field and kicked a game-winning field goal as time expired. A fumble in the second quarter in Illinois territory and a missed field goal in the third quarter were just about the only things keeping the Terrapins out of the win column. A much needed bye awaits Maryland this week but the Terps’ hope to rebound in their next game when they heads to Evanston to face the Wildcats. 6. Rutgers (5-2 2-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 8 Last Result: 27-24 win vs. Michigan State Next: at Indiana What a win for Greg Schiano and the Scarlet Knights! His team found itself down 24-6 in the third quarter and went on to score 21 unanswered points to win the game against Michigan State. Running back Kyle Monangai had a great day for Rutgers carrying the ball 24 times for 148 yards and a touchdown. Credit to Rutgers’ defense and special teams who caused three fumbles and executed a clever kickoff to essentially win the game. Look for the Scarlet Knights to carry this momentum next week when they head to Bloomington to play Indiana. 7. Wisconsin (4-2 2-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 6 Last Result: 15-6 loss vs. Iowa Next: at Illinois Wisconsin was another victim of Iowa’s suffocating defense. After scoring 24 points last week in a victory over Rutgers the Badgers were held to just two field goals at home. In a more depressing development Wisconsin’s starting quarterback Tanner Mordecai is out indefinitely after breaking his throwing hand in the loss. To make matters worse the Badgers go on the road to face an Illinois team coming off a solid victory over fellow Big Ten member Maryland. 8. Nebraska (3-3 1-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 7 Last Result: Bye Next: vs. Northwestern A victim of the bye week and Rutgers’ win against Michigan State Nebraska drops one spot to No. 8 in these power rankings. Matt Rhule and the Cornhuskers host the Wildcats in Lincoln this weekend. 9. Minnesota (3-3 1-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 9 Last Result: Bye Next: at Iowa Like Nebraska Minnesota is on its bye and looks to improve after an embarrassing home loss to Michigan last time out. The Gophers will head to Iowa City to face the Hawkeyes this week. 10. Illinois (3-4 1-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 13 Last Result: 27-24 win at Maryland Next: vs. Wisconsin Gotta give some love to Illinois whose hard fought effort against Maryland earned the team its first conference win of the season. Quarterback Luke Altymyer and running back Kaden Feagin had solid games combining to score the team’s three offensive touchdowns. However special mention has to be made to kicker Caleb Griffin whose two field goals including a game-winning one as time expired helped lift his team to a victory. 11. Northwestern (3-3 1-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 10 Last Result: Bye Next: at Nebraska A little rest and relaxation is just what the Wildcats needed after scrapping by a close win against Howard their last game. Rested and (hopefully) refocused Northwestern plays another team coming off a bye week when it heads down to Lincoln to play Nebraska this weekend. 12. Purdue (2-5 1-3 B1G) Last Ranking: 11 Last Result: 41-7 loss vs. Ohio State Next: Bye What can be said about this performance by the Boilermakers? Clearly their defense couldn’t stop Marvin Harrison and Co. while Purdue itself only converted three of its 17 third downs attempts. Two glowing spots for the Boilermakers are that they caused two turnovers and were called for only five penalties a far better mark compared to Ohio State’s nine penalties. After losing two consecutive conference matches Purdue heads into a much needed bye week to get itself back on track. 13. Michigan State (2-4 0-3 B1G) Last Ranking: 12 Last Result: 27-24 loss at Rutgers Next: vs. Michigan Entering the fourth quarter it looked as though interim head coach Harlon Barnett might get his first win for the Spartans. However a fumble recovered for a touchdown by Rutgers started an avalanche of unfortunate events that led to Michigan State dropping this game. After the lost fumble defensive and special teams miscues by the Spartans led to Rutgers scoring 14 points. This was a brutal loss that will sting even more if Michigan State posts an embarrassing outing again this weekend against rival Michigan. 14. Indiana (2-4 0-3 B1G) Last Ranking: 14 Last Result: 52-7 loss at Michigan Next: vs. Rutgers Can you believe Indiana led this game for the entire first quarter? Shocking but true! However dreams of an upset against the No. 2 team in the country quickly disappeared along with the team’s offense and defense.  The Hoosiers only totaled 232 yards for the game and turned the ball over four times. Michigan simply had its way with Indiana from the second quarter until the final whistle. Indiana will continue to try to earn its first conference win of the year when it hosts a Rutgers team coming off one of its more impressive comeback wins in program history.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story David Braun has yet to announce his starting quarterback for this weekend’s game at Nebraska but regardless of who’s under center the ‘Cats will look to stay in the win column against the Cornhuskers. A victory would pull Northwestern’s record above .500 something many fans thought was impossible going into this campaign. Here are three reasons why they’ll pull it off and three reasons why Nebraska will get its revenge. \nWhy Northwestern will beat Nebraska\n Ben Bryant if he returns I’m a believer again! Call me crazy but Bryant (whose injury might keep him sidelined this weekend) is a quarterback who can win games for the ‘Cats especially games like this one. Nebraska isn’t a dominant force like Penn State or even a tough draw like Duke. The Cornhuskers aren’t a team to take lightly but they’re beatable and it would help Northwestern immensely to have QB1 back under center. Northwestern is 3-3 coming off the bye week but the last time we saw this team on the field it was barely eking out a win against Howard. NU narrowly avoided disaster but it was way too close to comfort and felt way too much like the loss to Southern Illinois last year. Some of the blame should fall on the shoulders of Brendan Sullivan who was starting in place of the injured Bryant. It may seem harsh to blame the backup quarterback especially one who didn’t turn the ball over and won the game but Sullivan offers so little in the passing game. And if you are going to be a running quarterback you have to do better than 38 yards on 15 attempts. Braun has been noncommittal this week on Bryant’s return but his presence would give the ‘Cats a much better chance to win. Nebraska’s horrific pass defense This somewhat hinges on Bryant playing as well but even if Sullivan is under center the ‘Cats have to exploit the Nebraska secondary. The Cornhuskers are by far the worst passing defense in the Big Ten allowing 247.2 yards per contest in the air. That is really really bad. For context Northwestern itself only gives up 189.7 and most would consider NU’s secondary to be decent not great. If Cam Johnson Bryce Kirtz and the rest of the Wildcats’ receivers are able to find space as easily as I’m expecting then Northwestern cannot sit back and run the football all day. It is not the winning strategy against this defense. If Sullivan wants to prove himself as a Big Ten starter then he’s going to have to learn to throw the ball eventually. If he’s the starter on Saturday Northwestern has to cut him loose a little bit. It’s what’s best for him and for the team’s chances of winning. Confidence and rest As always some external factors will impact this game and two notable ones work in the ‘Cats’ favor. The first is confidence. Northwestern won a singular game last season and it was against Nebraska in Ireland. I’m sure that loss is lighting a fire underneath the Cornhuskers this week but it should also provide NU with a boost. The ‘Cats can win this one because they’ve done it before. It’s up to the coaching staff to make sure the players know that. Northwestern will also benefit from having a week off. The ‘Cats should have good legs after the extra rest. Granted Nebraska had a bye week as well but NU needed time to allow injured players to recover. The bye week is possibly the only thing giving Bryant a chance to go on Saturday. \nWhy Northwestern won’t beat Nebraska\n The ‘Cats’ defense doesn’t match up well with Nebraska’s offensive attack Nebraska has the conference’s second best rushing attack racking up 203.3 yards per game. In large part that is due to the fact that quarterback Heinrich Haarberg is a big factor in the running game. He leads the team in rush yards with 352. Running back Anthony Grant has also been productive this season. Northwestern meanwhile sports the Big Ten’s worst defense against the run at 172.3 yards allowed per game. The ‘Cats are also horrendous at tackling and have yet to run into a quarterback quite this oriented toward the run. The linebackers haven’t given any reason to believe they’ll be able to contain Haarberg so I’m going to predict they don’t. There’s a very real chance Nebraska dominates this game on the ground and Northwestern has no answer. Heinrich Haarberg  Haarberg is starting for the first time this year as a sophomore for the Cornhuskers and he’s had a very good start to his college career. In addition to his 352 rush yards Haarberg has been efficient with 5.1 yards per carry. When he’s had to pass Haarberg has been competent as well. He’s amassed 631 yards throwing four touchdowns to two interceptions. He’s not lighting the world on fire but he’s a serviceable thrower of the football. If Haarberg can use his arm to convert on third downs in this one Northwestern is going to have to watch out. It must prey on his comparatively weak passing ability or it will fall victim to his high-level rushing skill. Nebraska has a stifling run defense The Cornhuskers are second in the Big Ten at defending the run only allowing 75.8 yards per contest on the ground. Especially if Sullivan is under center this presents an enormous problem for Northwestern. The ‘Cats have to be able to rely on their run game in order to win football games. We’ve seen this play out all year. If the ‘Cats get nothing from Cam Porter and they fail to establish the run they have a hard time getting the passing game going too. Northwestern is going to have to find a way to overcome this strength of Nebraska’s if it wants to win on Saturday. Who knows: maybe Sullivan is actually the answer to this problem. Maybe the Cornhuskers won’t be ready for him. But they probably will be. Another high-attempt low-yardage game is more than possible for No. 6 on the ground. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Our Northwestern basketball player previews are in full swing! Today we’ll look at junior guard Melannie Daley who is in position to play a key two-way role for a new-look guard group. Who she is Junior; guard; 5-foot-11; from Hastings-on-Hudson New York 2022-23 stats 9 games 10.2 minutes per game 4.6 points per game 0.9 rebounds per game 0.4 assists per game 0.8 steals per game 48.6% FG% 71.4% FT% 2022-23 review After an impressive first season in 2021-22 when she made nine starts Daley only played in nine games in 2022-23. Even though her minutes were beginning to steadily increase as the ‘Cats approached mid-December she didn’t play in another game after dropping eight points on 4-of-7 shooting against DePaul on Dec. 10. Iowa head coach Lisa Bluder said she assumed Daley was dealing with an injury when she missed Northwestern’s January game against the Hawkeyes so I’ll take her word. If that’s the case it must have been a really tough pill for Daley to swallow especially after she played a critical role on the 2021-22 team as a bench scorer and an early-January spot starter in place of an injured Lauryn Satterwhite. Although most of Daley’s counting stats were down from 2021-22 she was showing clear signs of progression entering the Big Ten slate. After playing a combined seven minutes in the first two games against Oregon and Penn Daley averaged 12.1 minutes in her final seven games. In the process she recorded a steal in five straight games and shot over 50% from the field. Her best two offensive games came in succession as she shot 9-of-14 for a combined 19 points against Michigan and DePaul. She definitely appeared to be on track for a larger role.  Given that Jasmine McWilliams took Jillian Brown’s starting spot on the wing right after Daley’s final game there’s a chance that Daley’s midrange game and perimeter defense could have put her in contention for a place in the starting five had she played. Strengths Daley was a terrific midrange shooter in Year One and she continued to excel there in 2022-23. Daley went 7-of-18 last year for a 38.9% clip which was over 6% above the Division I average. Plus she was automatic around the rim converting eight of her 10 shot attempts in the restricted area. What makes those marks even better is that Daley centers her game around getting to those spots. Almost half of her shots in 2022-23 came from midrange and 27% came at the rim. In an offense that often revolved around getting Caileigh Walsh clean looks on the perimeter Daley didn’t need to bomb away. That helped her to use the entire floor playing off the ball and develop a rhythm taking catch-and-shoot 16-footers. On the other side of the ball Daley’s a solid perimeter defender. Despite a small sample size her steal percentage fell in between Kaylah Rainey’s and Sydney Wood’s. That’s pretty good company. While Northwestern struggled early last year its advantage of having quick guards on both the starting and bench units who could rack up turnovers gave a huge boost. And this was before Hailey Weaver really started to emerge as an absurdly skilled defensive player. Weaknesses It doesn’t show up on the stat sheet but Daley had her fair share of struggles as a facilitator. During NU’s blowout loss to DePaul she telegraphed a pass and then floated a post entry en route to fastbreak scores the other way. Daley also turned it over four times against Niagara in nine minutes. Again it’s tough to make a definitive claim with a small sample size but that appears to be an area where Daley still has room to grow. With Rainey and Wood now gone there’s a non-zero chance that she gets some minutes as the floor general for the second unit when Caroline Lau is off the court which makes that facet of her game all the more important. The departure of Northwestern’s starting guards last year also means that the ‘Cats will need some shooting from their backcourt. Daley has only made one three-pointer in her career so it’s unlikely that she’ll fill that role. However Joe McKeown and Co. are in desperate need of floor-spacers in addition to Walsh and Lau — especially off the bench — so Daley could give the backcourt a valuable layer if she can add to her repertoire a little bit. A midrange-centric game is typically inefficient by nature which means that Daley will either need to get to the rim even more (which she’s done well already) or take strides on the perimeter to take her offensive game to the next level. Expectations Lau and Weaver should form Northwestern’s starting backcourt for the next two years which probably means Daley will come off the bench unless McKeown slots her in for McWilliams who ended last season starting at the three. But that doesn’t mean the junior guard won’t play a huge role. Without Jillian Brown who transferred to Virginia this spring Daley is going to be Northwestern’s only returning guard on the second unit. She and Maggie Pina a grad transfer from Boston University should be primary sources of scoring outside the paint when Lau is off the floor. At 5-foot-11 Daley is also fairly versatile as a defender. Now that Wood is gone Northwestern could use some more switchable defenders on the perimeter and No. 21 can bring that to the table. If Daley can take the steps as a two-way player that she appeared to be approaching last season then she will be one of the better sixth women in the Big Ten with a really good case to enter Northwestern’s starting lineup come January. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Olsen @InvrrtedFB  Oct 19, 2023, 11:32am CDT      / new",Men’s soccer: ‘Cats suffer Friday the 13th woes in first defeat of season, Their set piece defending was especially spooky. Share this story It happened. The ‘Cats lost — and I’m not too sure what to say. The unbeaten run was always going to end at some point but now that it is over there’s just a weird sense of finality surrounding the season. Maybe the explanation for that vibe is just me expecting this first loss to snowball into a calamitous run of results because in reality the Wildcats still have all of their goals in front of them. They’re first in the Big Ten despite playing the fewest conference games of any team and while their national standing took a hit following last Friday’s events they’re still ranked in the United Soccer Coaches Top 25 — now No. 21 down nine spots from No. 12. Ultimately — and this is just educated speculation — I think head coach Russell Payne’s primary aim is to get the team into the NCAA Tournament and any conference accolades in addition to that are just a bonus. Especially as Northwestern has made a habit of winning games it arguably shouldn’t have over the past month and a half that competition’s highly variable nature would probably work to its advantage. However given NU’s current RPI (No. 45) relative to the size of the tournament field (48 teams including 23 conference champions getting auto-bids) getting selected this time around might require a Big Ten Tournament triumph. That’s far easier said than done. If a conference tournament win is necessary winning the regular-season title would provide a massive boost as Martin Stadium would host all of the ‘Cats’ matches. So while Northwestern can still accomplish everything it wants there’s a real (and unfamiliar) sense of urgency surrounding the tail-end of the season. If the Wildcats want to give themselves the best chance of reaching the NCAA Tournament for the first time in a decade they simply have to win — and then keep winning.  Before looking too far ahead let’s take a step back to examine what happened in State College. Friday Oct. 13 (University Park Pennsylvania) If you’ve seen a meme with the caption “When you lose a game of rock paper scissors to the mirror” then it should be fairly straightforward more or less to understand what happened to Northwestern last Friday. The Nittany Lions in a lot of ways were similar to the ‘Cats which from a strategic perspective doesn’t yield many intriguing points of discussion. This symmetry between the two teams includes a 4-2-3-1 structure OOP a reliance on set pieces not many innovative concepts with the ball and perhaps most importantly an uncanny ability to “win” decisive moments. In possession the best part of Penn State’s play (4-2-1-3/4-1-2-3 structure) was how its two CBs neutralized the NU (4-2-3-1) press. Often the Wildcat CF despite being left in a 2v1 against them can apply the requisite initial pressure to harry one of them into a pass that Northwestern can close down and then win the ball back. That did not really happen this time out to say the least. pic.twitter.com/OxrzejjgpX The composure these CBs showed for PSU set the entire foundation for its (admittedly limited) attacking gameplan. The extra touches and willingness to drive forward and possibly commit the AM opens up a lot although most of the time like in the above clip they’d skip the midfield line and just hit a diagonal to either winger. pic.twitter.com/PAsVP0CBt0 Penn State was also very creative from dead ball situations. Doing what they did in the below clip immediately made it crystal-clear the Nittany Lions were trying to maximize the potential of every free kick and corner they were awarded throughout the match. pic.twitter.com/IfZiAwQQiz A PSU player getting his head to that out-swinging delivery also set a very dangerous and recurring precedent. The home side got first contact on the majority of its set pieces and eventually that trend led to a goal with Jackson Weyman keeping out an initial effort from a corner but parrying it right into the path of another Nittany Lion who easily found the back of the net. That goal canceled out Justin Weiss’ opener a close-range strike from a Christopher Thaggard cross-cum-shot that was preceded by a rare stretch of composed thoughtful possession play from Northwestern. pic.twitter.com/Aphus6HUHg Overall the ‘Cats were at their usual level with the ball and that deteriorated as the match went on. They never looked like getting a second and while the usual 2023 NU men’s soccer script would have the team pulling a winner out of nowhere this was not an ordinary night. In the 73rd minute after a hopeful ball up the pitch turned into a 2v2 for Penn State a cruel twist of fortune befell Ibrahim Obeid. Just a couple of weeks ago the senior profited off a defensive blunder on a driven ball across the face of the goal to score his first of the year. Faced with preventing a similar pass from getting through to a PSU winger on his back shoulder he suffered a parallel fate getting his angles and timing all wrong. Seconds later a Nittany Lion was wheeling away in celebration. NU mounted a tame comeback with a couple of low-percentage chances coming and going. There might not have been much difference between the two sides between the boxes but inside them Penn State was vastly superior. So in very Northwesterny-fashion PSU walked away with a 2-1 victory.

Share this story As we continue our player previews for a highly-anticipated season of Wildcat basketball we turn to grad transfer Blake Preston who is slated to be a rotational piece for the ‘Cats as they look to make a second consecutive trip to the NCAA Tournament. Who he is Graduate student; 6-foot-9; from Charlotte North Carolina; Liberty transfer 2022-2023 stats (at Liberty) 35 games (22 starts) 17.3 minutes per game 6.7 points per game 5.1 rebounds per game 1.4 assists per game 0.5 blocks per game 0.4 steals per game 66.0% FG% 39.7% FG% 2022-2023 review A key veteran in the Flames’ lineup last season Preston served as the big man for a Liberty team that finished 27-9 falling just one point short of a ASUN conference championship and trip to March Madness after a 67-66 loss to Kennesaw State. In his fourth season with the program Preston set career bests in field goal percentage assists per game and blocks per game.  Preston leaves the program ranking 17th on Liberty’s all-time rebounding list having collected 535 across his four years in Lynchburg. Last season Preston notched 10 or more points on 10 different occasions posting a season-high 17 against North Florida. Although designated as a forward Preston assumed the big-man role for Liberty as the tallest rotation player on the Flames. He was often matched up against opposing centers. For a majority of the season Preston was on the court for somewhere between 15 and 25 minutes a game. Northwestern had a chance to see its future transfer up close when Liberty took on NU in the Cancun Challenge last year. Preston played 12 minutes in that game racking up four points on perfect shooting four rebounds and two assists in a 66-52 Wildcat victory. Strengths For starters Preston is a really solid rebounder who is especially effective on the offensive glass corralling nearly two extra possessions per game. He uses his size and physicality to position himself opportunistically. He’s reliable on the defensive glass as well and adds a few blocks as well on that end of the floor. Preston is crafty and efficient around the rim with a high make percentage. The transfer is a smart player who is wise in his shot selection usually careful about avoiding low-percentage shots. For a big man Preston has sneaky great vision that has only improved throughout his career as his career-high in assists from a season ago proves. He has sound spatial awareness isn’t especially prone to turning the ball over and can be effective with the ball both under the basket and at the elbow. Weaknesses The most glaring hole in Preston’s game is his struggles at the free throw line. Last year he shot just 27-of-68 from the stripe for a lowly percentage of 39.7%. We’ve seen Preston have success at the line before — his sophomore season he shot a much better 67.4%. But with a career rate sitting only a smidge above 50% Preston becomes an easy target for intentional fouls late in game making him a liability on the court. Preston offers little to no range as a shooter. His arsenal is limited to the paint which can make life easier on opposing defenses who don’t have to fear being spread out nearly as much.  In reviewing Preston’s tape I sometimes felt like he was slightly passive on offense and some of the numbers back that up. Preston declined from his career-high totals in points field goals and field goal attempts back in 2020-21 a season when he was playing roughly the same amount as last year. Expectations  Preston should slide right in to the role UTEP transfer Tydus Verhoeven filled last year. The two transfers are the same height and produced similar scoring outputs (6.6 points for Verhoeven 6.7 for Preston) in their final seasons before transferring to Northwestern.  A few key differences for the two players: Verhoeven was a significantly better free throw shooter whereas Preston is much better at staying out of foul trouble and is more effective at converting his shots on the floor. It’s not unreasonable to think that Preston should be able to produce at minimum the same stat line Verhoeven provided the ‘Cats a season ago: 15.8 minutes per game with averages of 2.4 points 2.6 rebounds 0.7 assists 0.6 blocks and 0.5 steals. Preston’s offensive potency should allow him to boost the output in both the scoring and assist categories. More often than not I expect Preston to be used as relief when Matthew Nicholson is not on the court. While I do think Northwestern will play with some big lineups deploying combinations of Luke Hunger with either Nicholson or Preston this team will continue to run through the guards. Yet Preston will be relied upon to do some of the “dirty work” as the ‘Cats try to compound their success. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story We are less than three weeks away from the Northwestern women’s basketball returning. Today we preview Hailey Weaver a two-way guard who will be spending a lot more time on the court this year. Who she is Junior; guard; 5-foot-11; from Solon Ohio  2022-23 Stats 28 games; 10.78 minutes per game; 3.0 points per game; 1.4 rebounds per game; 0.6 assists per game; 34.9 FG%; 25.0 3PT%; 63.6 FT% 2022-23 Review Weaver did not have consistent playing time last season only garnering 302 minutes over 28 games. As a freshman she played just six games for a grand total of 21 minutes so the sophomore season brought a clear learning curve for the guard to find her place with more appearances but not a lot of time.  Towards the back end of the season Weaver got longer outings. She played under eight minutes in each of her first six games but hit a then career-high of 11 minutes against Duke on Dec. 1. Across her last 13 games she played at least 15 minutes in nine of them including the last two games of over 20.  With the increase in playing time the Ohio native definitely saw improvement. Weaver didn’t attempt a three-pointer until six games in on the season and in her first 20 attempts she made just three. Throughout February however she attempted the remaining 16 of her 36 total tries for six baskets. One of the most notable aspects of Weaver’s play is her defense. Her small four minutes of play against Oregon in the season opener was all it took for her to record a steal. She recorded at least one in 14 of the games she played for 33 total placing her third on the team behind Sydney Wood and Kaylah Rainey. She ended the season on an impressive streak recording six one three and four steals in the last four games. Against Minnesota where she hit her career high with six she also sunk three baskets and recorded two rebounds for the ‘Cats.  Strengths  Weaver will likely become one of the more prominent two-way guards for the ‘Cats in the subsequent seasons.  The sophomore showed talent when it came to three-pointers as the season went on and had she maintained her three-point percentage from the last month of the season she would have led her team in that category. Along those same lines of offensive improvement Weaver became a better passer as the season went on. Seven of her 18 total assists came over just the course of the last four games. As she develops this skill Weaver may be a skilled assister.   Aside from excelling on steals she also displayed a knack for grabbing rebounds. She had 10 defensive and 29 offensive rebounds in total which contributed to 12 multi-rebound games. For a player who played a handful of minutes here and there her rebounding potential is certainly an advantage. Weaknesses Weaver lacked consistency but that’s difficult given she saw the court for less than 10 minutes in half of her games. Toward the end of the season Weaver proved she could record baskets and plenty of steals and if she had increased playing time earlier on then her totals could have been significantly higher. With the opportunity to be a starter Weaver will likely be able to develop more on offense. Of the nine players who appeared in at least 27 games last year Weaver ranked sixth with a 34.9 FG%. She made just a third of her shots within the paint over November and December. From February to the end of the season she attempted more shots but didn’t drastically improve her shooting percentage going 15-of-44.  Expectations This upcoming season won’t post the same problem for Weaver as her underclassmen ones; she should see significantly more minutes in each game. She has the potential to grow into a valuable two-way guard and can likely find herself in a starting position at the start of the season or soon after.  To fairly assess what’s in store for Weaver her last four games of the 2023-24 season speak to the player she can be. She averaged nearly 19 minutes in each and was able to record eight baskets from within the paint and two from outside 14 steals and nine boards. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After starting its season with the Notre Dame Invitational and ITA All-American Championships in early October Northwestern women’s tennis turned its sights to the Midwest last weekend. The ‘Cats headed up to East Lansing on Thursday Oct. 12 to participate in the ITA Midwest Regional Championships which ran through Tuesday Oct. 17. Returning most of their core from 2022-23 the ‘Cats were in prime position to push top players from Michigan Ohio State and Notre Dame among other schools. NU immediately started off the opening day with a bang. Four Wildcats were slotted into the qualifying draw for the singles tournament which meant each player had to win two matches in the field of 64 to snap up one of the 16 open spots in the main draw. Impressively three of those four players qualified: first-year Neena Feldman junior Kiley Rabjohns and first-year Autumn Rabjohns (Kiley’s younger sister).  En route to making it through that trio didn’t lose a single set in its combined six matches. As a result Northwestern found itself with nine players in the final 64. Jennifer Riester Justine Leong Christina Hand Sydney Pratt Maria Shusharina and Britany Lau rounded out that group. Only three players — Hand Leong and Kiley Rabjohns — were able to make it out of the first round but they made some noise. Hand made a run to the quarterfinals where she took national No. 16 Irina Cantos Siemers of Ohio State to three sets. Rabjohns and Leong both fell in the Round of 32 but the former took Wisconsin’s No. 119 Alina Murkhortova to three sets. Those two played a thrilling second set which Murkhortova won in a 7-3 tiebreaker. She’d eventually lose in the following round to Michigan’s No. 24 Kari Miller who ended up winning the whole thing. As that was unfolding an even better outcome was in the works for Northwestern. The Wildcats had five doubles teams competing for the title: Hand and Leong Pratt and Elisa van Meeteren Lau and Shusharina Feldman and Kiley Rabjohns as well as Riester and Autumn Rabjohns. Three of those five duos advanced out of the Round of 64 with Feldman and the elder Rabjohns falling in a long tiebreaker that ended 8-6 to cap off the one-set match. Hand and Leong the No. 26-ranked team in the nation earned a bye while Lau-Shusharina and Pratt-van Meeteren both secured easy 8-4 and 8-1 victories respectively. Unfortunately the latter duo faced a nightmare matchup in the Round of 32 with Michigan’s No. 4-ranked Miller and Jaedan Brown waiting for it. Although Pratt and van Meeteren lost to the eventual champions they put up a pretty valiant fight in an 8-5 defeat. Elsewhere Hand and Leong took down Illinois State’s Lana Caculovic and Tijana Zlatanovic 8-5 while Lau and Shusharina beat Valparaiso’s Diana Lukyanova and Isabella Righi 8-3 to send two Northwestern teams to the Round of 16. Both duos still weren’t done. Hand and Leong continued to pick up steam with their 8-4 win over MSU’s Issey Purser and Ria Bhakta but the biggest single-match performance of the weekend came from Lau and Shusharina. They faced Ohio State’s Sydni Ratliff and Shelly Bereznyak. Although OSU didn’t run out its top doubles team of Ratliff and Cantos Siemers ranked No. 14 in the nation it still had two extremely talented players working together. Ratliff is the No. 27 singles player in the country and Bereznyak is at No. 69. Lau and Shusharina are unranked so pulling off the upset seemed like a daunting task. The Northwestern duo went out and secured the victory handily earning an 8-4 win to put two NU teams in the quarters. Although Lau and Shusharina ran into Miller and Brown who won 8-4 Hand and Leong kept their run going. Forced into a tiebreaker by DePaul’s Greta Carbone and Hannah Smith Northwestern’s top team prevailed in a 7-5 nailbiter to earn the 8-7 win and move to the semifinals by the slimmest of margins. You can probably guess who was waiting for them there. However that didn’t stop Hand and Leong from giving Michigan’s stars a run for their money in the 8-6 loss. They played the champions tighter than all but one team in the tournament: Cantos Siemers and Luciana Perry of the Buckeyes who forced Miller and Brown into a tiebreaker in the final. For three of NU’s five doubles teams to all go down swinging against a Michigan duo that’s in contention for a national title is really encouraging. Hand and Leong flashed their talent both in singles and doubles play and proved that they’re more than capable of hanging around with the nation’s best. Perhaps even more importantly the ‘Cats got to see Lau thrive in doubles action against elite players like Ratliff and Bereznyak. A grad transfer from Brown Lau should be a crucial piece of Northwestern’s team come spring and her chemistry with Shusharina in doubles play only reaffirmed that. The ‘Cats will have another week and a half off before heading out west to San Diego for the ITA National Fall Championships on Nov. 1. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Northwestern had multiple chances to seize momentum and pull of a thrilling win on the road at Nebraska but fell just short in a 17-9 loss to the Cornhuskers. Its bowl game chances took a major hit as did some of its stocks. Read about the highs and lows below: Stock Up Northwestern’s secondary Northwestern’s secondary has shown flashes of brilliance throughout the season with its ability to limit deep passes but hasn’t made the game-changing plays necessary to really deliver a statement game. That changed on Saturday’s very first play when Devin Turner recorded his first interception of the season to immediately set the Wildcats up in Nebraska territory. After dropping at least two potential interceptions this year Turner came up with a gigantic play that set the tone for the day. That was just the beginning of a solid day for Turner and for the defensive backs. The sophomore safety recorded multiple physical tackles as did Coco Azema who delivered two massive hits on Heinrich Haarberg. Rod Heard II also snagged a pick of his own off Haarberg just two drives after Turner did. Although the NU offense couldn’t capitalize on great field position early and surrendered a 44-yard touchdown to Malachi Coleman in the fourth quarter it had a very good day. Run game Call this a penny stock because the value on this boomed after staying flat at zero for the first few drives. Mike Bajakian took seven plays to run a rush that didn’t involve Brendan Sullivan but the run game carried a middling NU offense through the first half. Anthony Tyus III ripped off back-to-back runs of 15 and 39 in the second quarter that put the ‘Cats in position to kick a 37-yard field goal to take a 6-3 lead. Adjusting for the eight sacks that Northwestern surrendered the rushing attack totaled 132 yard on 4.3 yards per carry. Cam Porter’s 20 yards on nine carries doesn’t look great at the surface but he turned multiple negative plays into short gains. Especially given how Northwestern struggled in the pass game (more on that later) it did a great job of generating some good plays on the ground given how one-dimensional it had to look at points. Special teams From kicking to punting to punt coverage Northwestern’s special teams excelled in Lincoln. After struggling mightily through his first six games Hunter Renner boomed four of five punts inside the 10. His first was downed at the 1-yard line thanks to some great coverage from Ore Adeyi. Later on he hit a beautiful boot that fell inside the 10 after rolling sideways. The punt team redeemed itself in a huge way and constantly kept Northwestern in the game by flipping field position. In the kicking game Jack Olsen almost remained perfect. He knocked a 45-yard field goal through the uprights that gave Northwestern its first lead after it worked itself out of much better position with negative plays and hit a 37-yarder. His one miss came from 54 on a kick that probably should have been a punt attempt. Olsen is now 6-for-7 on the year on field goals and has converted two of his three attempts from 40 yards or further. To send this stock soaring even further Nebraska kicker Tristan Alvano made a 47-yard kick after missing all three of his attempts from 40-plus before today.

Point-blank it’s almost impossible to win a game with a backup quarterback when he’s constantly getting pressured. This Nebraska defense is very good especially its defensive line and it showed why with its dominance. NU failed to generate explosive plays early through the air in large part because of Sullivan’s lack of time in the pocket. UNL defensive lineman Nash Hutmacher really shined as he recorded 2.5 sacks and countless pressures. Six other Huskers put up at least a half a sack and flustered Sullivan throughout the day. A new-look offensive line with Jackson Carsello at center continued to struggle in Big Ten West play leaving lots of questions for it to answer as the Wildcats will face even better pass-rushes once the calendar turns to November. Brendan Sullivan A few of those aforementioned sacks were on Sullivan and he made a few tough reads that could have made the game worse for NU offensively worse than it already was. He ended the game 12-for-23 with 176 yards many of those coming on a 66-yard catch-and-run to Bryce Kirtz in the late fourth quarter. Sullivan especially struggled with creating plays outside the pocket and with choosing when to do so. Some of the sacks he took single-handedly took Northwestern out of field goal range even though he made a few big plays through the air later on. His worst mistake came after Kirtz’s field-flipping play when Sullivan and the ‘Cats had an opportunity to cut the 17-6 Nebraska lead to three. He had a wide-open Marshall Lang in the flat but didn’t see him and fired an incompletion. This team needs Ben Bryant to have a shot at a bowl games or even five wins and it needs him soon. Penalties Thomas Gordon committed 30 yards’ worth of penalties by himself which should speak for itself. His block below the waist after A.J. Henning’s jumping catch took at least three points off the board for the Wildcats by moving them back 15 yards which proved to be a momentum-changer. All in all Northwestern committed eight penalties for 75 yards while Nebraska had just three for 30 yards. The holds on the outside by tight ends and the circumstances in which some of those false starts and 10 or 15-yard penalties came were disastrous. Northwestern had a shot to seize momentum countless times and shot itself in the foot with its offensive penalties.

Share this story Despite traveling out west to Lincoln Nebraska mistakes continued to follow and undermine Northwestern. The Wildcats (3-4 1-3 B1G) fell to the Nebraska Cornhuskers (4-3 2-2 B1G) 17-9 on Saturday afternoon. The Wildcats’ defense forced two turnovers but the offense continued to sputter without starting QB Ben Bryant. NU never found the end zone despite having seven possessions in Nebraska territory. Brendan Sullivan finished the day 12-of-23 for 176 yards but tossed an interception. On the ground NU’s running backs combined for 98 yards on 20 carries. For the Huskers Heinrich Haarberg was 8-17 for 85 yards but added 72 yards and a score on the ground. Northwestern won the toss but deferred to the second half. On the first play of the game Haarberg overshot his tight end and Devin Turner leaped up and picked the ball off to give NU the ball. It was NU’s first defensive turnover since Week Two. As soon as the Wildcats got the ball Sullivan dropped the snap fell on it; on the next play he was nearly intercepted. On third down Sullivan was dropped for a sack and NU had to punt. In a positive note Hunter Renner dropped a 50-yard punt down to the Cornhuskers’ 1-yard line. On Nebraska’s ensuing drive the Wildcats forced a three-and-out aided by a pass breakup by multiple defenders. Staring in Huskers territory Sullivan had the first completion on the day on a screen to A.J. Henning but missed No. 8 deep on second down. While the ‘Cats’ QB scrambled on third down he was well short of the sticks and the punting unit trotted onto the field for the second drive in a row. ""On the Huskers’ next drive Haarberg flicked a short pass out to Billy Kemp but Bryce Gallagher knocked the ball free. Although UNL recovered the fumble Northwestern capitalized on a pass off the hands of a Cornhusker which found Rod Heard II — who returned the ball all the way into the ‘Huskers red zone. However the ‘Wildcats offense was abysmal for a third straight drive going 14 yards backward. Despite the offensive struggles Northwestern got three points off the turnover as Jack Olsen connected on a 45-yard field goal attempt."" After a 36-yard kickoff return Nebraska barely got back to the line of scrimmage; however on third down Haarberg evaded Anto Saka off the edge danced around and found Alex Bullock for 15 yards into NU territory. The Cornhuskers had to settle for a field goal but Tristan Alvano hit a 47-yarder to tie the game at 3-3 with three minutes left in the first quarter. The ‘Cats went three and out again finishing the first quarter with zero total yards but still tied at 3-3. At the start of the second quarter Northwestern forced Nebraska into a third-and-13 but Haarberg scrambled for 16 yards and a fresh set of downs. However the ‘Cats’ defense locked down lighting Haarberg up on two straight plays and sending UNL’s punting unit back out there. It was the Tre Tyus show on the ‘Cats’ next drive. The junior picked up 61 yards on four carries including a 39-yard burst on a counter. Cam Porter pushed ahead for five yards for a fresh set of downs and put NU in the red zone. Inside the red area the Wildcats were unable to get in the end zone but Olsen converted on another field goal to put NU ahead 6-3. Nebraska drove the ball into NU territory on its next drive aided by a 15-yard face mask penalty. At NU’s thirty Haarberg pulled the speed option for a 20-yard gain but not without a bellringer from Coco Azema. Two plays later Haarberg dove into the end zone to send UNL into the halftime locker room up 10-6. Sullivan on a Hail Mary threw an interception to close out the first half. NU got the ball to start the second half. A drop by Cam Johnson set up the third and long and Sullivan threw the hot to Porter but a missed block by Caleb Tiernan allowed the ‘Huskers to bring Porter down before he could pick up the first down. ""On the Cornhuskers first play of the half Josh Fleeks could not handle the exchange and lost the ball but fell on it before a swarm of Wildcats dove into the pile. However Haarberg made up for the mistake with his arm and legs picking up the first down with a rush of 16. The Huskers then messed up another exchange and after an incompletion the ‘Cats were able to get off the field."" NU came out running the ball handing the ball to Porter three straight plays for a first down. On the ensuing play Sullivan underthrew a ball but Henning made a leaping grab for a 32-yard gain. However a 15-yard penalty on a chop block pushed the Wildcats back and Olsen’s 54-yard field goal fell short sending the Wildcats back to the bench empty-handed. After the missed field goal Haarberg missed a wide-open receiver down the sideline and Theran Johnson broke up a pass to set up a third-and-long. On third down NU knocked the pass down at the line of scrimmage and made Nebraska punt once again. On the next drive Sullivan found Kirtz for 17 yards but missed him on the next two plays setting up a third-and-10. Sullivan then scrambled for five yards and NU had to send the punting unit back out there. Renner pinned the Huskers inside their own five but a 24-yard run by Emmett Johnson moved UNL out of its own end zone. While Nebraska had to punt Henning struggled to corral the punt and was tackled on Northwestern’s 10. At the end of the third quarter NU still trailed 10-6. Sullivan was sacked on third down and on the next Nebraska play Haarberg launched a 44-yard pass to Malachi Coleman for a walk-in touchdown putting the Cornhuskers up 17-6. The ‘Cats refused to go down quietly. On second-and-10 Sullivan evaded the rush and dropped a dime into the hands of Kirtz who ran it inside the 10-yard line. Near the goal line NU stalled out and had to settle for another field goal cutting Nebraska’s lead to 17-9. After the score UNL had to punt the ball away. Sullivan converted a third-and-nine on a completion to Johnson to move the chains. Despite the positive plays another personal foul on Gordon pushed the Wildcats back 15 yards and a sack on Sullivan sent Renner and the punting unit back onto the field. Nebraska went three-and-out and NU got the ball back with just over three minutes to play. Sullivan picked up two quick first downs one on the ground and one through the air but a sack pushed Northwestern all the way to a third-and-16. Sullivan was nearly intercepted on third down and on NU’s last gasp Sullivan was taken down for the eighth time in the game sending NU home with a 17-9 defeat.

Share this story On the heels of its bye week Northwestern enters the second portion of its 2023 season on the road in Lincoln Nebraska. With both teams at 3-3 overall and 1-2 in Big Ten play a significant stake in the conference standings hinges on Saturday afternoon’s outcome. Will the Wildcats move to above .500 for the first time since they took down the Huskers to start 2022? Here’s what our staff writers forecast. Iggy Dowling: Nebraska 23 Northwestern 9 Assuming it’s Brendan Sullivan at quarterback it’s going to be tough for Northwestern to put up points on the road given how they’ve fared on the road. The Huskers have one of the better pass rushes in the division. The D-line should make life difficult for whoever’s behind center on Saturday given the Northwestern offensive line’s struggles thus far. I think it forces multiple turnovers that decide the game early. David Gold: Nebraska 24 Northwestern 10 This is the game that will decide the ‘Cats’ season.  With Ben Bryant out I do not think the ‘Cats have enough firepower on offense to win the game. Nebraska’s QBs do not inspire confidence so I’m expecting David Braun to load the box and force the Cornhuskers to beat the Wildcats through the air. Bradley Locker: Nebraska 24 Northwestern 13 I don’t think Northwestern will emerge victorious in this one regardless of who’s playing under center but the injury to Ben Bryant only magnifies my concern. The Wildcats’ defense should have its hands full with Heinrich Haarberg and Anthony Grant on the ground while the Cornhuskers’ stingy run defense could further imbalance issues for Mike Bajakian’s unit. On top of that although UNL has committed 13 turnovers through six games Northwestern has only five takeaways this year — and two have come on defense in non-garbage time situations. The Wildcats’ defense will need to actually snare or scoop the ball and I’m not putting my faith in that to happen. NU drops its third straight game in Lincoln. Ethan Segall: Nebraska 20 Northwestern 13 I’m genuinely nervous for this game which feels... amazing! It’s great to have Wildcat football with high stakes again — with a win the team has a real path to bowl eligibility! If this game were in Evanston maybe I flip my pick but the team has failed to show up for both of their previous road contests. I sure hope I’m wrong but I’ll go with the Huskers who I actually think are a bit underrated at the moment. Noah Poser: Nebraska 24 Northwestern 13 Neither of these teams inspire much confidence. Northwestern is coming off a bye which was sorely needed after a homecoming win that didn’t feel like much cause for celebration. Nebraska is also coming off a bye. In the team’s last game before that however it showed signs of progress and quarterback Heinrich Haarberg had a solid game. That alone is encouraging to the team’s cause. Ultimately what leads me to pick Nebraska is that the game is in Lincoln. The Cornhuskers are 2-1 at home this season with the lone loss coming to No. 2 Michigan. The Wildcats are 0-2 on the road and neither game has been close. Expect them to make it 0-3. Natalie Wells: Nebraska 27 Northwestern 10 The Cornhuskers have the third-most rushing yards in the B1G. The ‘Cats have allowed the third-most rushing yards in the B1G — not a good combination. Sophomore quarterback Heinrich Haarberg will gash NU’s defense for at least 100 yards with his legs as Nebraska gets over .500 for the first time this season. Ascher Levin: Northwestern 21 Nebraska 17 Coming off a bye week the ‘Cats have had the ability to get healthier for their game against Nebraska. A.J. Henning Richie Hagarty and Jack Lausch are all going to be back but the question is if Ben Bryant is going to start. If Bryant is healthy for the game Northwestern has a great opportunity to win this important game for their bowl aspirations. Nebraska’s starting quarterback Heinrich Haarberg leads the Cornhuskers in rushing yards with 352 this season. This year the ‘Cats haven’t been great at stopping a mobile quarterback most notably against Duke’s Riley Leonard. Northwestern will have to limit the quarterback run game if it wants to be successful defensively. While Nebraska has home-field advantage and has won three of its last four games I am predicting an upset Saturday afternoon.  Brendan Preisman: Nebraska 27 Northwestern 20 ""No I’m not only making this prediction so I’m allowed back in the state over winter break. Over the last couple of weeks one thing’s become clear about Northwestern’s defense: it can’t hold up in the second half. Obviously Penn State running away in the second half is understandable but allowing an FCS Howard team to outscore you 20-0 after halftime does not inspire confidence. The Huskers meanwhile seem to have found a new key to the offense in quarterback Heinrich Haarberg and hes got 237 rushing yards in his last three games. Nebraska will play a much cleaner game than last year and that will be the difference.""

Share this story Here we are. Gameday is here in Lincoln and Northwestern will face a critical test against Nebraska which will go a long way toward determining each team’s bowl game chances. To learn a little more about the Cornhuskers Inside NU had the chance to ask a few questions to the writers at Corn Nation Nebraska’s SB Nation site. Here’s what they had to say: Inside NU: We’re now four games into the Heinrich Haarberg Experience. How are Huskers fans feeling about him and the offense as a whole? Jill: He seems to have steadied the ship compared to the Jeff Sims experience. I think we still expect the defense to be the reason we win games but the offense is a bit more consistent with HH. I do wish he’d quit trucking linebackers when he takes off and runs. Starters last longer when they slide. Bri: He seems a bit more consistent than Sims and steady on his feet but the jury is still out on the passing game.  Todd: He shows improvement from game to game. He has had some big runs. Patrick: He is serviceable. Not too shabby.  Brian: Most Huskers fans have been pleased with him since Nebraska is 3-1 since he took over for the injured Sims and his turnovers haven’t cost Nebraska any games. The fans want the offense to be more productive but the sense that I get is that the fans are enjoying the return of a physical run game. INU: It’s obviously early but rate your satisfaction with Matt Rhule so far on a scale from 2022 Scott Frost to 10. Jill: I’ll admit I was slow to accept the failure of the Frost era but even I was well aware of how it would end by the first few games in 2022. Rhule is much better at not creating bulletin board material. He also seems to actually be fixing some of the little things Frost said he was going to fix. So I give Rhule a 7. It might be higher if the Minnesota game ended differently.  Bri: That’s a big scale. Currently I am going with a 6. I mean I didn’t expect miracles this year but I have to stay cautious as I’ve been burned by head coaches too many times before.  Todd: I put him at eight because he has built an infrastructure that works mostly behind the scenes that will serve the program well going forward. It is obvious now that there are adults in the room who have been able to put a decent team on the field in spite of the total dysfunction they inherited. Patrick: I’m going with a 6. There’s a lot of promise and it actually looks like he’s pulling a rebuild and not a quick fix. Something we all need to remember as this season moves along.  Brian: 10. It’s still early but Rhule is a true leader and the program builder that this university needs. He’s adapting to the players he has but still has player development in mind.  INU: Nebraska’s defense particularly against the run has been really great so far. What (or who) has been behind that and do you see it continuing against Northwestern and through the rest of the year? Jill: Well Nebraska fans are hoping no one notices the work Tony White is doing and hires him away. Also the emergence of the Polar Bear (Nash Hutmacher) has been big in that regard. I do see them continuing to perform well unless the injury bug hits. Bri: Tony White deserves a lot of credit but there were some solid pieces of the defense that we have seen doing good things for the last few years. Luke Reimer and Isaac Gifford have been consistent.  Todd:  Some good players had been brought in by the previous regime and have been supplemented by the current staff with some portal transfers.  Tony White has schemed very well and all of the position coaches have coached them up.  It has been a team effort. Patrick: There have been some decent players who saw a lot of time last year that have really come through this season. Like everyone said all on Tony White for coaching them up and making this defense into something that works well. As long as NU doesn’t pass we should be fine.  Brian: I was very skeptical of the 3-3-5 when Rhule announced the hiring of Tony White. However White has been remarkable and now I’m worried a team like USC is going to try and poach him away. I’m a bit surprised they’ve been able to be so good against the run with a bit of smaller defensive line but they should only get better as they continue to recruit big athletes.  INU: Outside of Haarberg Anthony Grant and Billy Kemp give us one UNL skill position player who you think has a shot at catching everyone by surprise on Saturday. Jill: We’ve been waiting for tight end Thomas Fidone to break out but after two serious knee injuries that may take longer than expected. I’ll go with one of our freshman wideouts. Theyll have to break out or we will reach Iowa levels of offense. Bri: Perhaps Saturday is the day that we really see all the hype around Malachi Coleman come to fruition.  Todd:  Jeff Sims if he sees the field. Patrick: Don’t sleep on Billy Kemp IV. The guy can make plays.  Brian: Malachi Coleman is getting the start since Marcus Washington is lost for the season. He’s a former five-star receiver that Deion and the Buffaloes really wanted. He’s tall and has elite track speed. I’d love to see Nebraska take a shot with him down the field. INU: Give us a score prediction. Who wins and why? Jill: The Huskers and Wildcats are rarely boring so I don’t see a blowout. I’m going to pick the Huskers just because but it will be a close one. Huskers 21 Wildcats 17 Bri: The Huskers win 35-17 because the Husker defense scores some points and puts the game away early.  Todd:  I’m not a prediction guy so I will give the same answer I give every game.  Nebraska will win 35-21.  Why?  Nebraska is the better team and despite the dumpster fire that was our team the last seven years they are not facing the same challenges as Northwestern.  The fact that the Wildcats have been in games and have three wins is remarkable.  Hats off to the coaching staff and players.  However Nebraska has to win this game and I believe they will do it convincingly. Patrick: University of Nebraska 9 Northwestern University 7. Nebraska wins because they have a coach.   Brian: Nebraska 27 Northwestern 10. I believe Nebraska will have two big splash play touchdowns on a long quarterback run and a pass. Defensively I think they’ll likely shut down the Wildcats but they tend to give up one scoring drive early in every game.    \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Following a necessary bye week and with the full second half of the season ahead of it Northwestern football earnestly felt like it was in a rather optimistic state. At 3-3 and with a pivotal game against Nebraska looming it seemed as if almost anything was possible — especially in the wackiness of the Big Ten West. However that positive momentum took a considerable hit for fans of the purple and white waking up Saturday morning. ESPN’s Pete Thamel reported that starting quarterback Ben Bryant was likely to miss his second straight game meaning backup Brendan Sullivan would get the nod yet again. Even if the point spread didn’t shift much cheeriness and hope certainly did. Despite having to start the team’s QB2 on the road the Wildcats had more than a legitimate chance to win to move to above .500 and even their conference mark. That’s precisely what makes Saturday’s 17-9 loss that much more of a difficult pill to swallow. It would be an understatement to proclaim that neither team played at a high level in Memorial Stadium. Neither the Wildcats nor Huskers mustered over 260 yards; only two trips to the end zone were made in 60 minutes; and the two sides combined for three turnovers and five fumbles (none of which were lost). But it seemed as if the Wildcats had a particularly ghastly set of mistakes — largely wasting consistent gains in momentum. In particular three specific sequences seemed to define why Northwestern fell to Nebraska. After picking off Heinrich Haarberg on the first play from scrimmage NU’s first defensive takeaway since playing UTEP on Sept. 9 Northwestern’s offense featured this set of three plays: a dropped snap from Brendan Sullivan a near interception on a late throw to an out route and a sack. The Wildcats lost seven yards despite starting in UNL territory with a clear-cut opportunity to make a statement and open a lead. Only two drives later Mike Bajakian’s offense again had an egregious missed shot. Rod Heard II corralled a ball in the air notching Haarberg’s second interception of the quarter and setting the ‘Cats up at the Nebraska 13. A hold from Marshall Lang zero-yard run from Jack Lausch sack of Sullivan and three-yard Cam Porter run made it a loss of 14 yards on the drive. NU did kick a field goal but that’s impressive levels of offensive ineptitude in that situation. And finally maybe the most painful drive yet. Trailing 17-6 with 13:57 to go in the game the Wildcats finally got a jolt on O courtesy of a deep ball from Sullivan to Bryce Kirtz; the receiver raced 66 yards down the near sideline before being tripped up at Nebraska’s 9. What did Northwestern do after that? A four-yard run two-yard sack (on what should’ve been a walk-in touchdown) and a short completion in the flat. NU’s offense lacked rhythm and explosiveness throughout the entire afternoon but those three possessions highlight the biggest problem for the ‘Cats this year: an inability to seize momentum and avoid the team getting out of its own way. With Ben Bryant under center the Wildcats’ offense has still been rather stagnant; at the same time the quarterback has shown a proclivity to hang in tough pockets make accurate throws and largely mask a rushing attack that’s struggled to find success. With Sullivan under center though the layers of the operation are pulled back that much further revealing the major issues. No matter who’s at quarterback it’s clear that Northwestern’s red zone operation and ability to succeed past the 50 are glaring weaknesses. At the other end of the spectrum the Wildcats’ defense held tough for the majority of the day. Although David Braun’s unit did surrender nine plays worth at least 10 yards including a 44-yard touchdown to Malachi Coleman to effectively ice the game NU primarily held strong by preventing trips to the end zone and getting the ball back either through turnovers or stops on third down. It’s hard to critique a unit that allows only 17 points but NU still yielded five plays of 15+ yards. In large part that occurred due to missed tackles which has proven cataclysmic for the Wildcats all year. There’s nobody to blame for missing one-on-one in the hole or getting bad angles in run support than Northwestern no matter the opponent. At 3-4 it would seem hyperbole to declare that NU’s season is already over especially given the wide range of outcomes across five games — in the Big Ten West with backup quarterbacks galore no less. But today’s result is deflating for a multitude of reasons. To reach postseason contention the ‘Cats will need to beat two (if not three) of Maryland Iowa Wisconsin Purdue and Illinois. That climb seems incredibly steep to make for any team this late in the season. Beyond that though Saturday underscored that this Northwestern team in its present version has still not amended many of its most fundamental problems. For NU players to still commit backbreaking penalties miss blocks and not secure ball-carriers is ultimately a reflection of a coaching staff that has yet to actually fix the team’s most basic downfalls. Yes Northwestern has seemed to improve in some areas throughout this campaign but that lack of progress seven games into a season is concerning. On top of those inherent flaws the Wildcats very well may not have Bryant under center for the foreseeable future. Braun was very non-committal postgame about the transfer’s availability against the Terrapins indicating that the team hopes to “get Ben back at some point this season.” What then does the gameplan look like to operate a more functional offense with Sullivan? How can Northwestern mitigate blitzes from defenses and get Sullivan comfortable in the pocket? On the flip side can NU’s defense finally get pressure on a quarterback and keep forcing takeaways? Until these significant questions are answered it’s hard to have a lot of faith in Northwestern football. Sure the Wildcats only lost 17-9 to a solid Nebraska team in front of more than 86000 red-faced fans. But Saturday is a microcosm of a season where David Braun’s team has yet to stack four good quarters of football with only five games to go — largely because of its own shortcomings. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Week Eight saw blowout wins comeback wins controversial wins nail-biting wins rivalry wins and plenty of losses to go with them all of which came in the heartbreaking variety. Unless you’re Indiana in which case you had an everyday run-of-the-mill blowout loss to Rutgers. Taking a look around the Big Ten this week let’s break down what type of statement each team had to say shall we? Ohio State draws first blood in Big Ten East with victory over Penn State The Nittany Lions arrived in Columbus with hopes of making a statement on the national stage. The good news is they managed to do just that. The bad news is it wasn’t the statement they were hoping to make. Instead it was Ohio State who captured the marquee win 20-12. The win was big for OSU for a couple reasons. The first being that it establishes the Buckeyes as the early front-runner in the Big Ten East as Michigan still has games against the Buckeyes and Nittany Lions left to play. The even bigger takeaway however is how Ohio State won the game doing so behind a stout defense. On a day where the offense was slowed by Penn State’s own stingy defense the Buckeyes’ stepped up on that side of the ball something we haven’t seen from the team in years past. It was a sloppy game overall but Ohio State came out of it with a statement of its own — one directed towards Michigan and the rest of the country. This defense is legit and fears no one. Michigan and Michigan State “battle” for the Paul Bunyan Trophy Michigan had a quick response to the Buckeyes’ statement in the form of a 49-0 win against its other rivals in East Lansing. This game was over almost as soon as it started in large part thanks to the new Heisman favorite Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy. McCarthy finished the game 21-for-27 for 287 yards and four touchdown passes. He exited the game midway through the third quarter with a 42-0 lead. It was quite a response to both the Ohio State-Penn State game earlier in the day as well as the lingering rumors of alleged sign-stealing taking place in the Michigan program. The Wolverines now sit at 8-0 with a tough stretch of games to close out the season. On November 4 they will return home for a rematch of last season’s Big Ten Championship game against Purdue. Michigan then finishes with road games against Penn State and Maryland before wrapping up the regular season with a matchup against the rival Buckeyes in Ann Arbor. For now the Wolverines head into the bye week having made a statement of their own. Outside noise isn’t going to be what stops them on their path to a potential national title. Big Ten West dramatics We all saw what stopped Iowa from winning its game against Minnesota on Saturday night and I’m not talking about its putrid offense. I’m instead referring to the embarrassing officiating that took a go-ahead Iowa touchdown off the board late in the fourth quarter. With 1:21 remaining in the game Iowa’s star cornerback and punt returner Cooper DeJean appeared to take a Minnesota punt to the house for a 54-yard touchdown that would have given Iowa a 16-12 lead. After a replay review the touchdown was inexplicably taken off the board after the officials decided to make a statement of their own and ruled that DeJean had waved for a fair catch (he hadn’t). The game ended with Minnesota winning 12-10 and securing the Floyd of Rosedale bronze hog statue for the first time in its last nine tries after a Deacon Hill interception ended the Hawkeyes’ hopes of victory. Elsewhere in the Big Ten West Iowa’s misfortune benefitted Wisconsin after the Badgers rallied from a 14-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat Illinois and retake control of the division. After falling behind 21-7 the Badgers finished with 18 unanswered points to pull out a 25-21 win in Champaign. Oh and did I mention that they capped it off with your everyday go-ahead touchdown catch by an offensive lineman. Yes Nolan Rucci did that. The Badgers now with a backup quarterback stand alone as the only team in the division with one or less losses. In doing so Wisconsin made the statement that it is in fact the team to beat in the Big Ten West (for this week at least). Nebraska! A special shoutout is in order for our dear friends in Lincoln. The Cornhuskers for the first time in 770 days have a winning record after their 17-9 win Saturday over Northwestern. Nebraska’s next two games are against Purdue and Michigan State so perhaps it can start a new more positive streak in the coming weeks. Wouldn’t that be quite the statement!

Share this story The sophomore slump is a well-cataloged phenomenon in which a player who had a breakout rookie year often succumbs to the grips of pressure and attention. Odds are that your favorite NFL team’s quarterback might’ve gone through the storied depression or maybe it was a hitting drought that downed one of your favorite MLB players. In simple terms it’s tough to taste success and not swallow it whole. To let success sprout is no easy feat and it’s something that extends beyond the second season of a star athlete’s career. It’s equally visible in teams as a whole — how surprise up-starts manage to handle the unfamiliar pressures of rankings and commentary following an impressive on-the-low season. Enter: Northwestern women’s fencing. Now to call the program which has boasted winning records in recent history an up-start is a disservice. Head coach Zach Moss has had his team’s mostly up to par since his hiring in 2016 but what he and the swords pulled off last year will now certainly come with expectations.  After finishing the 2021-2022 campaign ranked No. 33 in the UFCA Coaches’ Poll the ‘Cats went on a tear last season  — largely catalyzed by impressive freshmen performances — and ended the regular season at No. 4.  Megumi Oishi was about as prototypical a first-year phenom as you could imagine. The Portland native earned an All-American honorable mention at the NCAA tournament. Oishi’s freshman counterpart épée Karen Wang also notched an honorable mention.  Following wildly impressive freshman campaigns Oishi and Wang will genuinely have the ominous sophomore slump floating above their heads. And as a program NU will have to manage hefty expectations after a season that ultimately concluded in a No. 12 finish at the national competition. To kick the year off the ‘Cats hosted the Remenyik ROC and RJCC event at Ryan Fieldhouse. The annual meet brings together a swath of fencers from various club teams and colleges. Despite the mass of entries Northwestern managed to dominate start to finish. The two-day tournament began with a NU sweep in the junior women’s sabre event. Oishi claimed gold and two first-years Adele Bois and Amy Lu snatched second and third respectively. The event served as a promising sign that another incoming class of ‘Cats are in for a great debut season. In the Division I foil event once again Northwestern took the top spots — this time first and second. Yejine Lee and Rowan Park cleaned up both adding on to their solid finishes from last season. And of course what would Northwestern fencing be if not the Karen Wang show? The second-year took home first in the junior division of the épée category. If Moss and Co. hope to prolong last year’s successes Wang’s dominance in the event will be a must all season. Day Two was much of the same as ‘Cats claimed all types of hardware throughout the day. Notably Alex Chen a freshman earned first in the Division I category for sabres — ahead of Oishi who finished in third.  Just a few days after getting their feet wet the ‘Cats headed to Happy Valley this weekend to participate in the Garret Open which included squads from Penn State Ohio State Temple UNC Chapel Hill and Wagner. In the team’s first real test against Division I competition none of the purple fencers snagged a first-place finish. All the team’s best finishes came in the various senior divisions. Sky Miller a veteran staple for Moss’s squad posted the best outing. She nabbed second in the sabre event. Meanwhile Athina Kwon squeaked out a third-place finish among the épées and Rowan Park had the same outcome in the foil category. In all the visit to Penn State was nothing to write home about but it served as a fine tune up for a team coming off a season of high emotions that’s now battling high expectations. Great performances from the freshmen are reasons for optimism and the ever-steady presence of seniors like Miller should remain a guiding force for a Wildcat team with plenty of potential. Up next is the October North American Cup (NAC) — a recurring event throughout the season where NU’s top fencers can duel individually against the nation’s top swords. That’ll take place from Oct. 27 to Oct. 30. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Last Saturday Northwestern’s men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams hosted the University of Miami and Southern Illinois University in a home opener tri-meet at the Norris Aquatics Center. The women won 181.5 to 112.5 against Miami and 197 to 102 against SIU while the men beat SIU 207 to 89 (Miami does not have a men’s swim team). Similar to its meet against Miami (Ohio) on Oct. 14 Northwastern wore racing suits instead of training suits typically worn at dual or tri-meets which tend to make a swimmer’s times faster. Full results for the competition can be found here. Women’s recap After a rough weekend on the road where they lost to Cincinnati and fought an uphill battle to beat Miami (Ohio) the Northwestern women bounced back a week later to take down both of their opponents at home. In total the Wildcats won 10 out of 16 events on the women’s side. They got off to a rough start when their 200-yard medley relay lost to Miami (FL) by over two seconds but controlled the rest of the meet after that. Fifth-year Markie Hopkins (1-meter diving 3-meter diving) fifth-year Ayla Spitz (200 freestyle 500 freestyle) sophomore Hana Shimizu-Bowers (1000 freestyle 200 butterfly) and sophomore Linsday Ervin (50 freestyle 100 freestyle) all took two event wins each while junior Justine Murdock won the 200 backstroke. To cap off the meet Northwestern won the 400 free relay by virtue of Spitz overcoming a 1.31-second deficit to run down Miami’s Jane Fitzgerald during the final 100 yards of the race. Spitz’s split time of 48.67 on that relay was the fastest in the entire field and it was also her fastest 100-free relay split since the 2020 Pac-12 Championships — back when she was a freshman swimming at the University of California. Spitz the Northwestern graduate transfer who set season-best times in both of her individual races and also swam the butterfly leg of the 200-medley relay has impressed so far in her time in Evanston. She’s primarily a mid-distance freestyler who hasn’t raced sprint freestyle at a big meet individually since high school so the fact that she put up an impressive time on a sprint freestyle relay this meet means a lot for NU which lost many of its relay pieces from last season. Times-wise several Wildcats were faster than they were a week ago. Ervin and Shimizu-Bowers set season-bests in all of the events that they won while Murdock swam a season-best by over a second in the 200 back. Shimizu-Bowers was notably over nine seconds faster than she was against Miami-Ohio in the 1000 free and over two seconds faster in the 200 fly while Ervin went under 23 seconds for the first time this season in the 50 free (22.71). Men’s recap The Northwestern men continued their streak of dominance that they started the week before scoring over 200 points while holding their opponents to double-digits. Like the women they started out their meet with a loss in the 200 medley relay but then they went on to win 12 out of their 16 events. Sophomore Tona Zinn (200 fly 200 IM) and fifth-year Andrew Martin (200 free 500 free) were the two double winners for NU while other individual event winners included freshman Adam Cohen (three-meter diving) freshman Diego Nosack (1000 free) freshman David Grechik (100 back) fifth-year Kevin Houseman (100 breast) freshman Ryan Augustine (one-meter diving) freshman Cade Duncan (100 free) junior Tyler Lu (200 back) and senior Connor Morikawa (200 breast). Again similar to the women the Wildcat men won the 400 free relay to cap the meet holding off Southern Illinois by around half a second. The freshmen class was especially impressive at this meet as four different first-years took event wins. Duncan continues to be the team’s best sprinter clocking a 19.48 50 free split on the 200 medley relay to get under 20 seconds for the first time as a college swimmer. He also swam a time of 43.87 in the 100 free which is a season-best by 0.46 seconds. Nosack Grechik Morikawa Zinn (only in the 200 fly as he didn’t swim the 200 IM at any other meet) and Houseman all swam faster in their winning events than they did against Miami (Ohio). Houseman in particular clocked a time of time of 53.05 in the 100 breast which ranks him as the seventh-fastest swimmer in the NCAA for the race as of Oct. 22. He is currently the only Northwestern swimmer ranked in the nation’s top ten for an event. What’s next? Overall there was nothing super big to take away from Northwestern’s meet last weekend. The decision to wear racing suits two meets in a row is interesting considering that most swim teams don’t suit up at dual or tri-meets. Arizona State the No. 1 ranked men’s swim team right now is a notable exception — they’ve suited up for every one of their meets so far this season and have been dominating the national leaderboards on the men’s side. It’s worth noting that new Northwestern head coach Rachel Stratton-Mills previously worked as an associate head coach at ASU. Northwestern’s next competition is their midseason invite: the Purdue Invitational which runs from Nov. 16 to 18. Expect swimmers from across the country to swim considerably faster at midseason invites as they are important benchmarks in the college swimming season and often the first opportunity for swimmers to hit NCAA qualification times. The Purdue Invite should give us a better look at what trajectory Northwestern is headed toward this season as well as how it compares to teams across the Big Ten and the entire NCAA. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story It was a busy offseason for Chris Collins and Northwestern basketball. As we continue our player previews for the upcoming season we’ll take a look at another new face who arrived in Evanston via the transfer portal. Collins and staff hope sophomore guard Justin Mullins a transfer from Denver is a piece who can help contribute now and into the future. Who he is Sophomore; 6-foot-4; Oak Park IL; Denver transfer. 2022-2023 stats 32 games played (27 starts) 29.1 minutes per game 9.8 points per game 3.1 rebounds per game 1.1 assists per game 0.4 blocks per game 1.5 steals per game 51.8 FG% 69.2 FT%. 2022-23 review Mullins had a productive freshman season at Denver showing promise on both sides of the ball. He wasn’t much of a distributor but at 9.8 points a night Mullins was putting the ball in the basket at an impressive rate for a first-year player.  As a regular starter for Denver Mullins got valuable Division I playing time in 2022-23. However he was afforded that opportunity in large part due to Denver’s lack of talent and the uninspiring state of its program. The Pioneers went just 15-17 with a 6-12 record in Summit League play. So playing in the Big Ten — in hostile environments in games that have postseason implications — will be an adjustment for the young guard. But his well-rounded game should help him make the jump. Mullins was an effective defender for Denver and Northwestern is in need of exceptional perimeter defenders after the departure of Chase Audige. Mullins had 1.5 steals per game which was good enough for fourth in the conference. Additionally Mullins was relatively efficient posting respectable shooting percentages from both the field and beyond the arc. His three-point percentage was 36.5% a number that gives me real hope that he’ll eventually find his stroke in the Big Ten. His 69.2% from the foul line is a little low but he was a freshman. You can only hope he continues to develop from the stripe.  Strengths Mullins’ most important strength for Northwestern basketball’s future is his age. He is only a sophomore. Unlike Blake Preston and Ryan Langborg Collins went out and got this guy because he believes in his development and his potential to impact the program in the long haul. He might have guards like Boo Buie Ty Berry and Langborg ahead of him in the rotation this year but Mullins is seen as a future building block. Another important asset of Mullins is his athleticism and defensive prowess. From that standpoint losing Chase Audige was a complete killer. It’s hard to look at the depth chart for this season and feel great about the ‘Cats’ ability to hang with other talented athletic Big Ten guards. Without the reigning Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year Northwestern needs someone to step up. Mullins has the potential to be that guy defensively.  It’s also hard to ignore that Mullins did get buckets as a freshman for Denver. While the adjustment to higher level basketball and reduced playing time will probably impact his stats this year there’s reason to believe a future as a double-digit scorer is possible. Weaknesses Mullins is listed at 190 pounds but he’s a pretty skinny player from the eye-test. It’s hard not to wonder if he’s too skinny to be an effective slasher in the Big Ten. Additionally he was not an effective distributor for Denver which won’t matter much as long as Buie is in the fold but what about next year? What about the year after that? Are the ‘Cats just going to entirely change their offensive style of play to work around a ball-dominant guard who doesn’t pass well? It’s an area of his game he must improve. His free throw percentage is also a legitimate concern. Northwestern needs to be consistent at the line this year. It posted a 75.7% field goal percentage in 2022-23 which was the second best figure in the Big Ten and helped propel the group to a second place finish in the conference. Don’t write off Mullins as a free throw shooter just yet but know he’s a work in progress there. Expectations Expect his numbers to dip from last season. Mullins simply plays a position at which Northwestern has both depth and its best players. Langborg is going to get a lot more run early on as Collins and Co. hope to see good things from the grad-transfer. But count on seeing some of Mullins and probably even more of him in non-conference games. Northwestern wants to see what it has and there’s every reason to believe Mullins could be an impact player in the ‘Cats’ lineup. It might even happen this year. I don’t expect him to set the world on fire but I do anticipate that he’ll show flashes that get Northwestern fans excited for what’s to come. Julian Roper’s season last year as a sophomore represents a decent player comparison for what I expect out of Mullins. The outgoing transfer averaged 4.4 points per game and shot 45.3% from the field. Albeit Roper’s season was riddled with injuries but Mullins is likely to put up a similar campaign (hopefully without all the missed time). Mullins will occupy a similar role as a backup guard and if history repeats itself Collins will likely deploy him in a similar fashion. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Things were not pretty. Following a thrilling 23-20 homecoming victory against Howard Northwestern headed into its bye week to prepare for the second half of its season which features five opponents from the competitive Big Ten West. To kick off this slate of in-conference matchups the Wildcats traveled to Lincoln on Saturday to take on the Nebraska Cornhuskers in a showdown with huge implications for the division title. Northwestern was without starting quarterback Ben Bryant for the second straight week as he continues to recover from an upper body injury he sustained against Penn State. Despite his absence however the team had high hopes to come out with a victory against a Nebraska squad that’s had its own share of struggles. But despite a strong defensive performance the offense proved pitiful as the Wildcats mustered just 9 points. Here are five things we learned from Northwestern’s deflating loss against Nebraska. 1. The offensive line continues to struggle Could we try and bring back Rashawn Slater or Peter Skoronski? The offensive line has been woeful this year but its performance against Nebraska has to be the worst to date. The unit gave up 8 sacks which is Northwestern’s most in one game since 2000. That brings the season total to 30 meaning the Wildcats are giving up more than four sacks a game. Sure Brendan Sullivan wasn’t completely blameless in the loss but how can he even take time to think when he’s instantly being bombarded by Nebraska’s front seven? Additionally six of the eight penalties called against Northwestern can be attributed to an offensive lineman the most egregious being a 4th quarter false start called on Caleb Tiernan on 3rd-and-3 when the Wildcats were only down 10-6. Careless mistakes like those are inexcusable in a game that close against an in-conference opponent. Northwestern needs its offensive line to perform if it wants to salvage its season especially with formidable defensive units like Iowa coming up on the schedule. 2. Is this team scared of good field position? In what has seemed to become their specialty the Wildcats failed to capitalize on several instances in which they were gifted outstanding field position. On the first play of the game Heinrich Haarberg’s pass was intercepted putting the Wildcats around midfield to begin their first offensive drive. They promptly went three-and-out in a drive that included a Brendan Sullivan fumble and a subsequent sack. A few minutes later the Wildcats picked off Haarberg again putting the offense on the Nebraska 13 with a great chance to score. What ensued however was a holding penalty and another sack forcing Jack Olsen to kick a 45-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter following a 66-yard pass to Bryce Kirtz the offense once again went three-and-out and had to settle for another field goal after a promising trip to the red zone. Simply put the offense’s failure to take advantage of prime opportunities cost the team the game. The offense could have put up 21 points as a result of the three aforementioned drives. Instead they scored six. This has been a recurring problem all season and if the Wildcats even want to think about a bowl game they need to address this glaring issue. 3. Ben Bryant please come back soon As I said before Brendan Sullivan wasn’t exactly getting any help from his teammates. And yes he did show some flashes of talent including the 66-yard bomb to Bryce Kirtz in the fourth quarter. With all that being said Sullivan’s performance against the Cornhuskers was pretty lackluster. Throughout the first half he repeatedly left the pocket too quickly which resulted in a fumble that was fortunately recovered. Add on to that an unflattering interception and a completion percentage barely above 50% and it becomes evident that Saturday’s performance was one to forget for the junior quarterback. Now all of this is not to say that Ben Bryant has been this team’s hero but with the fifth-year under center the offense certainly would’ve been in a much better position to capitalize on some of the opportunities provided by the defense. Bryant has more experience and more importantly better chemistry with some of the team’s most dangerous weapons including wide receiver A.J. Henning who returned this week from injury. Brendan Sullivan is certainly capable of leading the team to victory as evidenced by his performance at Ryan Field against Howard but Ben Bryant is a much safer bet. 4. What a day for the defense Much of the talk about Saturday’s game has revolved around the dormant offense but can we give the defense some credit? Sure it gave up its fair share of big plays but it was generally quite effective in stymying Nebraska’s offense. The Wildcats held Haarberg to 85 yards of passing and picked off two of his passes to set the offense up in enviable field position. The unit could have been more effective in stopping the run and rushing Haarberg but at the end of the day it’s hard to blame the loss on a defensive squad that only allowed 17 points. Given the state of the offense this season and the uncertainty surrounding Ben Bryant’s availability in the coming weeks it will be imperative for the defense to continue competing at a high level to keep Northwestern in games. If they let up even a little bit Northwestern fans are in for an ugly finish to the season. 5. It’s still too early to give up hope Was Nebraska an important game to win? Yes. Did the team fail to show any signs of life? Yes. Does that mean the season’s gone? No. It would be a total overreaction to declare the season over at this point. At 3-4 the Wildcats are still in the thick of a fierce competition for the Big Ten West division title. As it stands right now they are two games out of first with five games to go. Yes the competition will be tough. To qualify for a bowl game the Wildcats will have to beat at least three teams between Maryland Iowa Wisconsin Purdue and Illinois. Those first three in particular will be pesky opponents. However Purdue and Illinois are very manageable and with Iowa just losing a close game to Minnesota it’s clear that the Hawkeyes are not invincible either. There’s still a viable path to a bowl game and potentially even the Big Ten West title. NU fans should be cautiously optimistic about the weeks to come. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After a bitter defeat in Lincoln on Saturday Northwestern returns to Ryan Field for a Halloween matchup against the Maryland Terrapins. The Terps who have dropped their last two pose many challenges to the Wildcats on Saturday. Both squads are looking to get back in the win column and winning these key matchups could decide who leaves Ryan Field victorious. Northwestern’s secondary vs Taulia Tagovailoa NU will see its second-best quarterback of the season on Saturday. Tagovailoa has been balling this season already throwing for nearly 2000 yards and tossing 16 touchdowns with just five interceptions. The Terps’ gunslinger has passed for over 200 yards in all but one game this season averaging 275 yards per contest and has posted a passer rating of 140 against conference opponents in 2023.  On the flip side NU’s secondary is the strength of its defense. The Wildcats have allowed an average of under 175 yards per game through the air this season including just 85 yards against the Huskers. Take out one play and Northwestern allowed under 50 yards passing. Furthermore the Wildcats forced two takeaways last weekend. Whether Northwestern can recreate its success against Maryland and Tagovailoa is yet to be seen but the defense will have to play at a high level once again if the ‘Cats want to walk away victorious. Northwestern’s O-line vs. Maryland’s pass rush Let’s be blunt: Northwestern’s offensive line has been abysmal in 2023. The Wildcats have allowed four or more sacks in over half of their games this season including two games of seven or more sacks. This team has made multiple changes throughout the season to its starting five trying to find the right combination but nothing seems to be solving the issue. On the other side of the ball UMD is fifth in the Big Ten in sacks and has four players with 10 or more pressures this season. NU’s tackles who have struggled mightily this season will have to contend with edge rushers Quashon Fuller and Donell Brown throughout the game. Especially if Northwestern ends up in third-and-long situations which has happened often this season the ‘Cats will have a long day against this Terps pass rush. Northwestern vs. getting off the field One of the main qualms with the Wildcats’ defense this year is its inability to get off the field on third and fourth down ranking in the bottom of the Big Ten in both of those categories. On the other hand Maryland excels in those two areas offensively. The Terrapins are second in the Big Ten in both statistics converting on third down 45% of the time and on fourth down a whopping 90% of the time. The Wildcats will need to keep UMD out of third-and-manageable situations or the Terps have a good shot at keeping the drive alive. If NU wants to win this game it has to find away to stall drives and force Maryland to send out the punting unit.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After Northwestern’s 17-9 loss to Nebraska on Saturday David Braun and his team will look to get back on track at home against Maryland this coming Saturday. The interim head coach spoke with media members on Monday afternoon about Ben Bryant’s injury status special teams prepping for UMD’s offense and much more. Opening statement: “Back in the facility yesterday and our guys were back at it this morning for morning meetings. Did not get any easier yesterday going back and reviewing the film [against Nebraska]. You have a group that is disappointed in the result but also very hungry for what’s still ahead. I think you can just see that in the way our guys are carrying themselves. It’s an intense group it’s a group that knows our best football is still ahead of us and is anxious to come back later this afternoon and totally shift their frame of mind and focus onto a very good Maryland team that’s gonna be coming into Ryan Field. We’re gonna learn from Nebraska we’re gonna grow and very confident very optimistic about what’s still in front of this football team.” On whether the team’s reaction to the Nebraska loss differed from past losses: “That’s a great question. It is different. You have a football team that has really started to find their confidence their identity. There’s always been a level of togetherness but I think that’s only grown as the season has gone along. I think you truly saw a team Saturday evening into Sunday that fully expected to win that football game and left every ounce of their being out on that field. I think that’s where that element of disappointed and a sense of being crushed came from. But you’ve got a group that came into the facility this morning is amped up is ready to grow from it and get better and that expects to have a great week of preparation moving forward. I think the way that we help them navigate that as a coaching staff is to embody and carry a great deal of optimism and energy. And also hold ourselves as a coaching staff and hold the team as a whole accountable to all the little things we need to continue to improve upon to win games in the Big Ten.” On continuing to struggle with red zone offense pass-blocking and pass-rushing and whether those issues have improved: “There’s been elements in terms of our protection offensively that have been clicking for sure. You look at the Minnesota game and some of the things that we were able to do in the second half a lot of that had to do with our ability to protect the passer. An operation like Penn State an operation like Nebraska [is] very aggressive very pressure-oriented. Those are areas that we need to continue to improve upon. In terms of affecting the quarterback defensively there’s certainly been some bright spots of guys being able to get after the quarterback. Nebraska didn’t give us a whole lot of opportunities to do that on Saturday but those are two areas that will continue to be points of emphasis: protecting our quarterback and finding ways to affect our opponent’s quarterback.” On complimenting the special teams group of Jack Olsen Hunter Renner and Will Halkyard: “Their performance warranted it. The way that those guys performed in terms of being able to create advantageous field position Jack being able to get us on the board [and] even on that missed field goal that came up just short Will with his operation from a snapping standpoint all critical things that often get overlooked or taken for granted. Those guys are a model of consistency in terms of their preparation. Probably something that we could point out every single week but especially this week they deserved an extra little pat on the back.” On whether Jackson Carsello will remain the starting center: “We’ll evaluate that day-to-day. A decision hasn’t been made on that just yet but Jackson had a great two weeks of practice merited an opportunity for him to start.” On if there’s an update on Ben Bryant’s injury status: “At this point there’s not. We’re taking it day-to-day. We’re very confident Ben will be back at some point this season it’s just kind of a fickle deal that he’s working through and hopeful that he’s healthy sooner than later but we’re taking it day-to-day. For that young man you can just see the level of frustration that he’s dealing with. He’s hungry to get back but at this point no update. Taking it day-to-day.” On whether there’s been any change in the timeline of Bryant’s injury or the coaches’ concern with it since the Penn State game: “Nothing’s changed. Just an optimism from our standpoint that if we approach this with a mentality that guys are gonna get back as soon as possible and also never putting guys out on the field until they’re fully ready to go. We’re going to stay optimistic with our rehab approach and keep certain elements of that information in-house and take it day-to-day.” On Brendan Sullivan and the offense’s performance against Nebraska: “I thought Sully battled his tail off and found ways to create some plays. The completion down to A.J. [Henning] the completion to [Bryce] Kirtz under intense pressure moving his feet sliding in the pocket finding a way to get that ball off. We’ve got to do a better job of protecting Sully and putting him in situations where he can feel really clean in the pocket step into some throws and create some rhythm.” On Maryland’s offense: “They’re really good. Well-structured run game a bunch of juniors and seniors up front with the offensive line that understand what they’re trying to accomplish. A very deep talented wide receiver room and a quarterback that operates at an extremely high level. The way that he processes information scans the field understands coverages understands how to attack coverages with the pass concepts that they’re utilizing. As you continue to watch the cut-ups and watch the film it’s an impressive operation. It’s no surprise that they’re averaging over 30 points a game and it’ll be a great challenge for a defense.” On watching film from Northwestern’s loss to Maryland in 2022: “Have watched the tape. Again little bit different operation last year just with who they had starting at quarterback in our matchup last year [Billy Edwards Jr.]  but still just well-structured. They do a good job of mixing inside zone outside zone some gap scheme enough element of quarterback run game that keeps you honest. It’s well-balanced it’s well-thought-out they utilize tempo in certain situations that can stress you. Well-coached operation with really good personnel.” On conversations with Mike Bajakian: “Those conversations happen weekly whether it be the positives that I’m identifying or the things that we need to improve upon especially early in the week and then as Mike and I connect throughout the week. There’s not a single person in this facility that doesn’t want to see that area of our offense and operation continue to improve. At the end of the day as you evaluate those scenarios we certainly have to execute but we have to find ways to just keep the ball and the chains moving forward. Too many times this season when we’ve positioned ourselves either through simply field position or explosive plays after A.J.’s big catch we find ourselves in situations where we’re behind the sticks the ball’s going backwards and now all of a sudden we’re out of rhythm. Those are things that Mike and I have had conversations about and we’re taking active steps to tweak some things to ensure that area of our offense improves.” On the nature of in-game conversations with Bajakian: “At the end of the day considering the context of the situation and the way all this happened I was never going to be a micro-manager of the offense. The conversation and consistency with those conversations has not changed. It’s Sunday conversations postgame it’s check-ins throughout the week with a very thorough check-in on Friday and a trust that Mike and the offensive staff [are] going to put our guys in the best situation to win games.  “In-game it’s more strategy time management conversations about things that I’m seeing from a standpoint... Second-to-last drive of the second half a very effective drive in terms of our run game and some of the things that were set up. Tre Tyus really got going. Just simple comments of like ‘Hey man keep rolling with it. Tre’s running the ball really well right now.’ But at the end of the day I know from calling defense for a long period of time one of the worst things you can do as a head coach is be too involved especially when the offense or defense is on the field. You’ve got to trust that a play-caller is gonna find a rhythm. The worst thing you can as a head coach is in-series be too involved where you don’t allow that play-caller to stay in rhythm and just do their job.” On whether Anthony Tyus III’s lower snap total in the second half stemmed from Bajakian disagreeing with Braun’s input: “No I’m not mandating who’s in who’s out. I trust our offensive staff to make in-game adjustments and decisions as they continue to manage our offense. I’m gonna continue to give feedback on the things that I’m seeing specifically from my role as the head coach and also my years of experience as a defensive coordinator on things that stress a defense that hopefully provide the offensive staff with information that can help them continue to move the ball.” On the secondary: “I think you see a group that’s continuing to find more and more confidence just finding a certain rhythm with one another. I think you find a group that’s becoming more and more comfortable in the scheme that we’re utilizing. You find a group that is responding to some challenges we’ve put in front of them in terms of being more ball-aggressive and having an attitude that when the ball is in the air it’s our ball. At the end of the day what a great challenge for us coming in here with Maryland. A very productive efficient pass game that will challenge us in every facet of their passing game whether it be RPO drop-back pass quick game screen game. Very well-structured.” On wearing black uniforms at home three times in a row: “That is a question I don’t feel positioned to answer right now. I’m gonna continue to stay in my lane and as I continue to grow in this role maybe I’ll continue to collect information. And as I become more informed have a more convicted opinion on that.” On whether there were conversations with tight end Thomas Gordon about technique after he committed a 15-yard cut block penalty: “The conversation is eliminating gray. The call came back to his pre-snap as he shifted his alignment earlier in the game. When we had the same shift on we did not give any gray for the official we were clearly within the tackle box. As Thomas shifted back in you could argue round and round about whether it was legal or not based on his pre-snap but there was certainly an element of gray. The conversation that we’ve had as a staff and as a team is that as we continue to move forward we’re going to take 100% responsibility we’re going to take extreme ownership and we’re not going to point the finger at outside influences that we can’t control. And officials are part of that they’re doing their best to call the game. [Gordon] has got to do a good job of getting himself clearly within the tackle box and then execute his assignment. If he gets his alignment in an area that there is no gray there’s no issue on that play.” On Brendan Sullivan and instilling confidence in him: “I think you just continue to build off of some of the things that we’re seeing in practice. He’s continuing to get better and better each week. I see a young man that battles. And that’s all you can ask out of your quarterback. I’m confident our group is confident. We’re going to continue to improve we’re going to find ways to protect Sully in the passing game. As long as he continues to trend in the direction he’s trending right now very confident that Brendan Sullivan’s going to find ways to help us win a lot of games moving forward.” On keeping Cam Porter’s spirits high despite a limited role: “I had an opportunity to visit with Cam earlier today a couple times. He is the ultimate team player the ultimate captain embodies selflessness. At the end of the day would Cam like to touch the ball 30 times a game and rush for 140 yards every week? Absolutely because he’s the ultimate competitor. But Cam’s always going to put the team first and embodies what this program is all about. I think the encouragement to Cam is a very simple and very straightforward ‘Just keep being you man.’ He is a huge reason why this team is positioned to still do great things in the second half.” On how the team’s resilience after past losses benefits it this week: “It’s just the character of the group. We all know this is a unique season for a lot of different reasons and I think you’ve got a group that just steps back in the facility owns the previous week and then goes and attacks the next opportunity. Fully expect us to do the same this week.” On how experienced defensive players have helped him as a first-year head coach: “It’s a credit to our players it’s a credit to that defensive staff. Again unique circumstances but what I can tell you is I’ll ask someone in our team room ‘Hey how we doing this morning?’ and [players respond] ‘Great coach how are you?’ The amount of times that guys are honestly asking me that question right back it is so easy to get into this facility and be around our guys and just go pour everything you’ve got into them. And coach them hard and mentor them and spend time with them and pour into them. “Coco [Azema] the way that dude plays the game all you’ve got to do is turn on the film. It’s contagious. It’s energizing it’s awesome. It makes it awfully fun to coach this group. He’s not the only one. Very easy to show up every day and just go to work with these guys.” On setting and adjusting goals as the season moves forward: “The goal moving forward is find a way to beat Maryland. We’re in the third quarter of our season we’ve got to set the stage for how we’re going to move forward. But all of our efforts and energy have to go into finding a way to get a win back at Ryan Field which is an opportunity that we’re really excited about.” \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story The postseason is close which means so is the making of a deep Northwestern postseason run.  Northwestern clinched a share of the Big Ten regular season title with victories over No. 16 Penn State and No. 4 Rutgers over the weekend marking the program’s first since 2013. With 15 straight victories the No. 1 team in the nation has well-earned championship expectations. Here are three reasons from the Northeast road trip that show why. Northwestern can handle some adversity  Following a 2-0 victory over Penn State Northwestern found itself in a more challenging position against Rutgers. The Scarlet Knights got on board in the first quarter and held their lead up until the fourth quarter before Ilse Tromp scored and sent the game into overtime. Then double overtime. Then shootouts.  Rutgers was perfect through the first three one-on-ones while only Peyton Halsey made a shot for Northwestern. Behind 3-1 in the shootout goals from Olivia Bent-Cole and Lane Herbert along with a save from Annabel Skubisz made it even again. Rutgers seemed to halt the comeback and cement its victory with its last shot hitting the backboards but the goal was reversed. Keeping up with the extended overtime the game went into an additional shootout. Skubisz denied the Scarlet Knights and Halsey scored to clinch a portion of the Big Ten title. Whether behind all game or behind in its very last chance Northwestern proved it has the will to keep on going.  Longest winning streak in program history.  @NUFHCats rides 15th straight win to a share of the @bigten regular season title. pic.twitter.com/k15V30C7Ey A notable absence from the lineup since Michigan on Oct. 1 is Maja Zivojnovic. The second year proved herself to be a pivotal piece to the ‘Cats on both offense and defense tallying nine goals through 12 games.  Despite not having Zivojnovic for some of the toughest games this season the defense remained solid behind Skubisz. The senior goalie currently has the third-best save percentage in the country of .357 after 13 saves this weekend and Northwestern leads the NCAA in save percentage with .866. The Wildcats have amassed 16 goals and allowed just eight. The team that has limited the second most goals is Rutgers at 16 — double the amount of the ‘Cats.  The roster is deep. Given some challenges here and there Tracey Fuchs has the tools to power through.  In with the new and the old From the first-years to the veterans Northwestern has played well with each other all year.  Senior Lauren Wadas led the way for the ‘Cats against Penn State scoring both goals off penalty corners. Alia Marshall’s valuable experience as an inserter has been ever so apparent this season as the graduate student helps NU excel in these opportunities. Nine of its last 12 goals came off corners.  Against Rutgers the underclassmen proved their worth. Graduate student Halsey got the game-winner but it was first-year Bent-Cole who broke the scoreless streak on the shootout. It was also Tromp a first-year who broke through on a penalty corner assisted by Marshall and Lauren Hunter to tie the game in the fourth quarter.  The target is on the Wildcats’ backs  Rutgers is one of the best teams in the country and has shown that with wins over now No. 9 Maryland and No. 10 Ohio State. While it was close the ‘Cats outshot the Scarlet Knights 15-10 and did not even allow them a single shot in the entirety of the second half.  All eyes were on the Wildcats to see how they would square up against their Big Ten foes at the end of the season. Northwestern has done nothing but exceed expectations. With shutout victories over ranked teams in Michigan Iowa and Penn State and clawing their way back to take down Rutgers on the road the ‘Cats have proved they are deserving of their No. 1 ranking and are the team to the beat. With a share of the Big Ten regular season title under wraps Northwestern will play Maryland on Thursday before the Big Ten Tournament next week. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story With basketball season inching closer let’s keep previewing a squad hopeful of returning to the Big Dance. Today we’ll look at one of Northwestern’s most important pieces: Matthew Nicholson. Who is he? Senior; center; 7-foot; 255 pounds; from Clarkston Michigan 2022-2023 Stats 34 games (25 starts) 21.0 minutes per game 6.3 points per game 5.4 rebounds per game 1.2 assists per game 1.2 blocks per game 0.6 steals per game 61.4% FG% 47.8% FT% 2022-2023 review After appearing in 24 games through his first two campaigns in Evanston Nicholson started 25 games for the ‘Cats last season. Coming off the bench to begin the year Nicholson’s impact on both ends helped the 7-footer outplay Tydus Verhoeven for the starting spot by mid-December. After dropping nine points and eight boards in his first start against DePaul the Michigan native never looked back solidifying himself as a key cog in Northwestern’s starting group. However offensive inconsistency hampered Nicholson early in conference play. The center missed all seven of his shots against Ohio State on New Year’s Day but found other ways to impact the game with two blocks and a season-high 13 boards. Against Rutgers ten days later Nicholson struggled to score again finishing with only three points and seven rebounds but he also held one of the conference’s best centers in Clifford Omoruyi to a season-low four points. Against No. 1 Purdue Nicholson’s defensive effort especially in the first half was huge helping limit one of college basketball’s best players Zach Edey to only 10 first-half points. Later in the year Nicholson posted 10 points and six rebounds in the regular season finale at Rutgers helping the ‘Cats secure the No. 2 seed in the Big Ten Tournament. He closed off the season strong against UCLA finishing with nine rebounds and a career-high 17 points on seven-for-seven shooting in Northwestern’s heartbreaking March Madness exit. Strengths Nicholson’s size is his best asset. With his length the Michigan native is an effective rim protector in the heart of Northwestern’s double-team heavy defense. Plus Nicholson has proven he can keep up with the Big Ten’s best in Omoruyi and Edey after flashing his defensive abilities a season ago. With a never-give-up defensive mentality Nicholson’s disruptiveness is huge for Northwestern especially after losing its best defensive piece in Chase Audige. Expect the ‘Cats to rely heavily on their big man’s imposing paint protection to power their defense this season. Offensively Nicholson is best within five feet of the basket attacking the glass. He works well with Boo Buie in the two-man game looking for alley-oops or two-hand jams off the bounce pass. Look for Nicholson to use his physicality inside to get high-percentage looks at the basket. Weaknesses Nicholson’s footwork and lack of defensive fluidity can be a problem. Although he’s got the size to keep up defensively he’s not the same athlete as the Big Ten’s best big men making him rely on defensive positioning and staying out of foul trouble — two things that are by no means guaranteed. This also makes it challenging for Nicholson on the glass who as a 7-footer you might have expected to grab more than 5.4 rebounds per contest a season ago. Offensively Nicholson’s lack of a post game with his back to the basket makes him an ineffective option for Northwestern to consistently feed inside. This forces Nicholson’s offensive output to come in the pick-and-roll game or from cleaning up the offensive glass. However a lack of touch or confidence around the rim are his his biggest offensive weaknesses especially without a jump shot to stretch defenses out. Too many times last season Nicholson found himself in a favorable matchup on a smaller defender around the rack but didn’t fight through contact to go up with the ball. Plus Nicholson struggles at the free throw line finishing last season at a paltry 47.8% from the charity stripe. At times if the 7-footer made one of two from the line it felt like a mini-miracle. Nicholson has to improve his free-throw shooting if Northwestern’s offense wants to be better than it was a season ago.  Expectations It may be bold to say and some may even disagree but Nicholson is Northwestern’s second most important player behind Boo Buie. Although he isn’t the best athlete or offensive threat his defensive energy and length are paramount to the success of Northwestern’s defense without Audige. As a shot blocker around the rim or making it difficult for opposing offenses to find space to operate in the paint expect Nicholson to command the middle of the court for Northwestern. The conference schedule is a dogfight and Nicholson’s interior defense gives Northwestern the chance to compete against the Big Ten’s physical style. Offensively if Nicholson is able to find a mid-range jumper Northwestern’s offense could open up significantly. That may be wishful thinking but after an offseason of work expect the big man to improve his touch around the rim and especially at the free throw line. Although he’ll never be the primary focus in an offense with talented playmakers like Buie Ryan Langborg Ty Berry and Brooks Barnhizer Nicholson has shown he’s capable of scoring in spurts so don’t discount solid offensive performances sprinkled through underlying offensive inefficiency. If he can find a little more consistency scoring the ball and staying out of foul trouble don’t be surprised if Nicholson’s success correlates to tallies in the win column for the ‘Cats.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story As we inch closer to the start of the 2023-2024 Northwestern women’s basketball season we continue to take a look at each player suiting up for the ‘Cats this season. Today we will preview Maggie Pina the lone transfer joining NU. Who is She? Graduate student; guard; 5-foot-7; transfer from Boston University 2022-2023 Stats 33 games played; 33 games started; 27.9 minutes per game; 9.4 points per game; 2.4 rebounds per game; 1.8 assists per game; 40 steals; 44.1 FG%; 37.5 3PT%; 70.7 FT% 2022-2023 Review Pina started her final season in Boston off strong for the Terriers. In the season opener she shot 4-for-6 from beyond the arc. While the graduate student dropped significant numbers in the scoring department including 22 points against Saint Joseph’s she had multiple games under five points. Despite her struggles Pina’s near-10 points a game would have made her the third-highest scorer on the Wildcats. Her 44.1% from the field was a career-high. ""Towards the back half of the season Pina’s scoring slowed down despite playing nearly every minute. In her final four games Pina had three games with only one field goal. In her senior season Pina helped lead BU to a 17-1 Patriot League record and a regular season title. In the Patriot League Tournament Pina played 95 minutes but only scored 13 points across three games including a mere four points in the Terriers loss in the Patriot League Championship."" Strengths For a Northwestern team that struggled mightily scoring the ball last season finishing  202nd in the nation last season in scoring offense Pina brings an experienced scoring threat to the offense this season. Her ability to shoot the ball specifically from deep will bring instant support to a squad that shot a meager 26.7% from beyond the three-point line. Pina can also play solid defense and help the ‘Cats ease the loss of Sydney Wood on that end of the floor. Off the court Pina brings years of experience to a relatively young ‘Cats squad. Northwestern will rely heavily on the backcourt duo of Hailey Weaver and Caroline Lau who started a combined three games last year so Pina will help guide the two through the ups and downs of a season. Starting 33 games last season the graduate transfer showed she can run an offense efficiently with the Terriers and should be able to slide right into the Wildcats’ rotation for the upcoming season. Weaknesses For a guard Pina struggles in areas outside of scoring the ball. During her time in Boston the graduate student only averaged 1.2 assists per game and 2.1 rebounds per game. Playing nearly every minute of the game last season Pina still averaged less than two assists. Northwestern averaged just 15 assists last season finishing in the bottom 25% of the Big Ten. It is an area the ‘Cats need to improve on this upcoming season and they will need Pina to take a leap in that category as well if NU wants to be successful this season.

Share this story After embarking on a stretch in which it played four of five matches on the road Northwestern volleyball returned home for a mini-homestand against then-No. 2 Nebraska and Michigan last week. Fitting with the theme of its season the two matches had tons of peaks and valleys. The Wildcats lost to the Huskers in straight sets on Wednesday before coming back on Saturday to defeat the Wolverines in five and improve to 4-6 in Big Ten play. Nebraska entered Welsh-Ryan Arena undefeated and immediately proved why. Sophomore middle blocker Bekka Allick dominated from the start picking up three kills and two block assists in the early going to propel UNL to a 7-3 lead. Kills from NU’s Averie Hernandez and Leilani Dodson kept the first set from getting out of hand but those two points sandwiched three straight kills by the Huskers. A 14-6 deficit didn’t deter Northwestern which went on a 4-0 run highlighted by an ace and a kill from Alexa Rousseau. However that’s when Merritt Beason began to take over. She helped extend Nebraska’s lead all the way back to 24-14 with three kills and an ace in that run alone and Andi Jackson punctuated the 25-15 set win off an assist from Bergen Reilly. The ‘Cats battled late in the first but the Huskers’ eye-popping hitting percentage of 48.3% overwhelmed them. It only got tougher for Northwestern in the second set as Nebraska put up a hitting percentage north of 54%. However the Wildcats responded well initially especially against UNL serves. Ellee Stinson’s defense and a few kills from Dodson and Rylen Reid brought the ‘Cats to within four (17-13) deep into the set. From there though Nebraska regained its composure to take the second set 25-16 committing only one error the entire set and putting up a kill percentage right around 60. The third set was NU’s best one. Dodson shined both as a blocker and as a server while Hernandez and Kathryn Randorf each sparked big runs with multiple kills that helped the Wildcats tie the Huskers up at 16. However Nebraska once again slammed the door shut thanks to four straight kills from Harper Murray. Hernandez continued to shine in a dominant set en route to an 11-kill night but the Cornhuskers forced her to commit the attack error that won them the contest. Northwestern could only a manage a 14.1% hitting percentage for the match and fell below .500 overall. Three days later the ‘Cats had a great opportunity to rebound against Michigan which came to Evanston with a 3-15 record and a 1-8 Big Ten mark. Where did that lone victory come from you might ask? It was against Northwestern just two weeks prior.  The Wildcats were out for revenge and they made it clear. After falling behind 8-5 NU ripped off an 11-1 run to seize control of the first set. Maddy Chinn picked up three kills and a block assist to fuel the stretch. Michigan put up a couple points here and there but back-to-back aces from Gigi Navarrete and four kills from Hernandez gave the ‘Cats a 25-13 win. Northwestern appeared to be taking care of business with a 10-7 start to the second set but this time it was Michigan with the comeback. Valentina Vaulet totaled eight kills in the set leading her team to kill percentage of 45.2%. She spearheaded the closing 6-0 run to tie the match up at one with a 25-19 win. Shane Davis’s team continued its struggles in the third as UM again took control with a run in the middle of the set. After cutting Michigan’s lead to 11-9 Northwestern never got within three points again. A hitting percentage of just 5.9% — following up a 2.7% mark in the second set — made it difficult for the Wildcats to spark a hot stretch offensively. With its backs against the wall they clawed their way to a back-and-forth fourth set with the Wolverines. Again it was Hernandez who shined as she smacked three aces before NU had put up 15 points. Following two service errors from Reid two more kills from Chinn gave the ‘Cats a 19-18 edge. Northwestern kept picking up more kills but Michigan’s Kendall Murray dominated to force back-to-back match points with a one-point lead. The Wolverines couldn’t clinch the win on either as Hernandez and Chinn each picked up kills. After the former Purdue player picked up a block assist and Rousseau punched a kill of her own Northwestern found new life with a 28-26 set win. In the fifth set a number of Michigan errors and Northwestern kills proved to be decisive. The Wolverines had it tied at seven but then committed three service errors over the remainder of the set to give NU three of the points it needed for the 15-11 set win and the 3-2 comeback. Stinson accumulated 24 digs — the third-highest total in her career — while Chinn Hernandez and Dodson racked up double-digit kills. Michigan had a better kill total and hitting percentage than Northwestern for the match but its 19 service errors compared to NU’s two was costly. The Wildcats will head back on the road this afternoon to take on Ohio State at 5 p.m. CT before heading back home to face off against Indiana on Sunday at 1 p.m. The OSU match will be broadcast on Big Ten Network and the one against the Hoosiers will air on Big Ten Plus.    \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story When I think of the Big Ten West the first things that come to mind are strong defenses low-scoring games lots of punting and ultimate chaos. That is exactly what the Wildcats’ game against Nebraska felt like last Saturday.  Northwestern went into Lincoln with a chance to reach an above .500 record for the first time this season. In the perfect representation of the Big Ten West the ‘Cats went back and forth with losses and wins through their first six games of the year. That streak continued with a 17-9 loss to the Cornhuskers.  The question of how to evaluate this team is an interesting one. If you told me before the season that Northwestern would be 3-4 through seven games this season I would have been ecstatic. However after watching the game on Saturday I’m no longer sure that’s how I feel. Nebraska was arguably one of the more winnable games left on the schedule and with the way the defense performed the Wildcats should have ended up with the victory.  There were positives and negatives from the game which also encapsulates the entire season. The defense held Nebraska to 17 points and should have been good enough to win the game. In terms of turnovers Northwestern recorded two interceptions from Rod Heard II and Devin Turner both occurring within the first three drives of the game. A strong start like that should also lead to a victory. Nebraska was also held to 248 total yards of offense the fewest number of yards given up by the Wildcats this season.  The defense combined with a strong special teams performance also led to the Wildcats having a better starting field position than the Cornhuskers for the majority of the game. Hunter Renner averaged 43.5 yards on six punts including four dropped within the 20 forcing Nebraska’s lackluster offense to drive even further. Jack Olsen was also strong on field goal attempts making three of his four attempts with the lone miss being from 54 yards.  Despite the defensive success the offensive struggles were the reason for the loss. Ultimately the offensive line was not good enough and prevented Brendan Sullivan from having nearly enough time to make anything happen. Sullivan was sacked eight times while going 12-of-23 for 176 yards. This led to the entire offense being made up of three field goals while failing to convert in the red zone.  This type of game from Northwestern was the epitome of a Big Ten West game. The Wildcats did their best Iowa impression with the low scoring offense strong defense and high volume of punts. The ‘Cats limited ability to throw the football also fit right in.  Overall this game left more questions than answers. With Ben Bryant missing a second straight game due to injury it’s very clear that the offense takes a hit when he’s not behind center. While Sullivan provides the mobility to deal with a poor offensive line the offense clicks better with Bryant. The question surrounding Bryant’s health is a massive one that will follow this team.  Even with the questions at quarterback the offense needs to get the run game going. The ‘Cats were able to pick up rushing yards towards the later part of the first half against Nebraska but it quickly went cold in the second half. A better rushing attack would help open up the passing game and make it easier for Sullivan or Bryant to work but so far this year that has not been the case.  The biggest takeaway from this game was clearly the dominance of the defense. David Braun has clearly shown that he knows how to coach a defense. Most importantly Braun deserves a lot of credit for the improvement that the defense has shown in nearly every game so far. With Maryland coming to Evanston this upcoming Saturday the unit will have a tough road ahead against a Terrapin offense that averages over 30 points per game. While Northwestern has turned out three consecutive strong defensive performances there are still questions about whether it can be done consistently.  Looking towards the rest of the season a bowl game is not out of reach for the Wildcats words that might have seemed crazy to write two months ago. Northwestern will have opportunities to pick up wins if they can continue to be solid defensively the type of game plan that will be conducive to winning in the chaos of the Big Ten West.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Michigan (8-0 5-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 1 Last Result: 49-0 win at Michigan State Next: Bye New week same result as Michigan dispatches another Big Ten opponent. This week’s victim is cross-state rival Michigan State. From the kickoff Michigan had this game in the bag scoring on its first drive of the game. The Wolverines had a 28-0 lead at halftime and they didn’t let up. Michigan scored three more touchdowns and compiled 477 yards on the day — just an absolute domination of a rival. Again Michigan should not only be ranked number one in the Big Ten it should also be ranked number one nationally. 2. Ohio State (7-0 4-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 3 Last Result: 20-12 win vs. Penn State Next: at Wisconsin Ohio State now has two signature wins against top-10 opponents winning one possession games against Notre Dame earlier this season and now Penn State. This is a tough physical team. Ohio State’s defense was very stout holding the Nittany Lions to only 240 total yards and only one third down conversion in 16 tries. Marvin Harrison Jr. Ohio State’s superstar wide receiver had himself a day at the office. Harrison caught 11 passes for 162 yards and scored a crucial fourth quarter touchdown to seal the win for the Buckeyes. 3. Penn State (6-1 3-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 2 Last Result: 20-12 loss at Ohio State Next: vs. Indiana Tough loss for the Nittany Lions at the Horseshoe on Saturday. Their defense was solid against this potent Ohio State team only allowing 20 points. However it was Penn State’s offense that couldn’t get the job done. Penn State only rushed for 49 yards and passed for 191 yards. The Nittany Lions simply could not convert on third down. They were only 1-16 on third down and although they never turned the ball over Penn State simply could not get deep enough into Ohio State territory to score often enough. Look for Penn State to rebound and work out its frustration against Indiana Saturday. 4. Iowa (6-2 3-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 4 Last Result: 12-10 loss vs. Minnesota Next: Bye Just a brutal heart-wrenching loss for the Hawkeyes Saturday. Iowa’s offense continued its season long trend of simply showing up and hoping for something positive. The team only generated 127 total yards and gave up three turnovers. The most damning stat is that Iowa ran the ball 28 times and only gained a measly 11 yards. This offense is simply not competitive enough. Iowa’s defense was stellar holding Minnesota to only 12 points and less than 250 total yards. Although a fair catch signal negated a go-ahead punt return touchdown for Iowa the special teams and defense did enough to win this game. The Hawkeyes’ offense is holding back both other units of the team and is torturous to Hawkeye fans. 5. Rutgers (6-2 3-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 6 Last Result: 31-14 win at Indiana Next: Bye Greg Schiano has helped his Scarlet Knights become Bowl game eligible for the second time in his second stint as head coach. Rutgers controlled the game on the ground in this one rushing for 276 yards. The Scarlet Knights had the ball for over 37 minutes due in large part to running the ball 55 times. Rutgers running back Gavin Wimsatt led the ground attack rushing for 143 yards and three touchdowns. This team probably won’t have a shot at winning the top heavy Big Ten East Division but it is holding its own so far in what is shaping up to be Greg Schiano’s best season at Rutgers during his second stint. 6. Maryland (5-2 2-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 5 Last Result: Bye Next: at Northwestern Usually in these rankings bye weeks are neutral. But when a team like Rutgers last weekend has a great win they’ll jump the bye week team. So Maryland is a victim of the bye week this time. Look for them to come out fresh and energetic when the team travels to Evanston to play Northwestern this weekend. 7. Minnesota (4-3 2-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 9 Last Result: 12-10 win at Iowa Next: vs. Michigan State The Golden Gophers went into Iowa City faced down the Hawkeyes vaunted defense and came out with a win. Neither offense was very productive but Minnesota caused three turnovers which stymied Iowa’s already unproductive offense to a near grinding halt. I expect Minnesota to build on this strong win when it heads back home to play Michigan State this weekend. 8. Wisconsin (5-2 3-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 7 Last Result: 25-21 win at Illinois Next: vs. Ohio State In a resilient win for the Badgers last weekend Wisconsin had to overcome a 14-point deficit in the fourth quarter to beat Illinois. Wisconsin’s defense really clamped down on Illinois in the fourth quarter only allowing 64 yards in the frame. Wisconsin overcame a slow start to win this one but it has a tough test upcoming this weekend when it hosts Ohio State.  9. Nebraska (4-3 2-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 8 Last Result: 17-9 win vs. Northwestern Next: vs. Purdue Was this game a defensive slug fest or an offensive no-show from both teams? For the sake of both fanbases I’ll go with a strong defensive showing from both squads. Under that notion Nebraska did a good job limiting the Wildcats to converting only 3-of-15 third down attempts.  This wasn’t a solid statement win but a win over a conference opponent is positive overall. Look for the Cornhuskers to try to continue their October winning ways when they host Purdue this weekend. 10. Purdue (2-5 1-3 B1G) Last Ranking: 12 Last Result: Bye Next: at Nebraska Unlike Maryland Purdue finds itself as not only a bye week winner but due to the performances of the two teams below it the Boilermakers find themselves jumping up two spots. The bye week was much needed for the Boilermakers as they look to try to shake out of a two-game losing streak. Purdue heads to Nebraska for a showdown with the Cornhuskers Saturday afternoon. 11. Illinois (3-5 1-4 B1G) Last Ranking: 10 Last Result: 25-21 loss vs Wisconsin Next: Bye Bad home loss for the Fighting Illini. Giving up 18 unanswered to lose the game by four points is not a good look no matter who the opponent is. Illinois only ran three plays in Wisconsin territory in the fourth quarter. The team’s offense simply could not muster a strong drive while its defense crumbled behind them. Illinois has now lost three of its last four games so its upcoming bye week is much needed before the team heads into final month of games. 12. Northwestern (3-4 1-3 B1G) Last Ranking: 11 Last Result: 17-9 loss at Nebraska Next: vs. Maryland Disappointing loss for the Wildcats. The defense was great for Northwestern limiting Nebraska to under 250 total yards and forcing two turnovers. Unfortunately the Wildcats’ offense simply couldn’t get going. They struggled on third downs and only rushed for 81 yards on 39 attempts. This was definitely a winnable game for the Wildcats so dropping this one stings. However the Wildcats cannot let this loss linger as they host Maryland this Saturday in what should be a tough matchup for Northwestern. 13. Indiana (2-5 0-4 B1G) Last Ranking: 14 Last Result: 31-14 loss vs. Rutgers Next: at Penn state Here we reach the bottom of the Big Ten. Indiana follows up its big loss to Michigan with another poor showing at home against Rutgers. The Scarlet Knights ran all over Indiana rushing for 276 yards and averaging five yards per carry. They didn’t turn the ball over and they dominated the time of possession having the ball for over 37 minutes. Indiana’s tough stretch continues next week when they go on the road to play Penn State. 14. Michigan State (2-5 0-4 B1G) Last Ranking: 13 Last Result: 49-0 loss vs Michigan Next: at Minnesota At the very bottom of the Big Ten Power Rankings this week we have Michigan State. The Spartans and Wolverines looked like they were playing in different leagues on Saturday. Michigan State only managed 10 first downs compiled 182 total yards committed 11 team penalties for 102 yards and even turned the ball over twice. To make matters worse the Spartans had a wildly inappropriate pregame trivia segment on their video board. It’s bad enough that the team isn’t competitive on the field but having the technical staff overlooking a faux pas like this is just embarrassing and unacceptable. Perhaps Michigan State can put up a better effort this weekend when they head on the road to play at Minnesota.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Who She Is Senior; 5-foot-11; Indianapolis IN; Guard. 2022-23 Stats 30 games played (20 starts); 11.1 minutes per game; 2.7 points per game; 2.0 rebounds per game; 1.1 assists per game; 0.1 blocks per game; 0.3 steals per game; 28.3% FG; 10.0% 3PT; 69.2% FT. 2022-23 Review In her first season as a true impact player (her freshman and sophomore seasons saw just three total starts) Jasmine McWilliams proved she could be a major factor to the Wildcats’ success. Though her stats may not jump out on the page McWilliams was a keystone to Northwestern’s women’s basketball team. McWilliams was one of the most efficient rebounders on the roster –  her two rebounds per game were good for fourth-best among returning players – despite only logging just over 11 minutes per game. After two seasons which saw little meaningful action for McWilliams due to her being an underclassmen on rosters filled with a plethora of talent head coach Joe McKeown gave her a chance to prove herself. She proved her worth as a rebounding guard as well as a very talented passer (she finished third in assists per game among returning players).  Arguably the least developed facet of her game was her scoring. Though she only averaged 3.3 field goal attempts per game McWilliams had less-than-ideal shooting numbers posting 28.3/10.0/68.8 shooting splits. As she likely faces a bigger role this coming season especially scoring wise it will be crucial to the ‘Cats’ success for the Indianapolis native to be able to take advantage of the scoring opportunities she is bound to receive.  Strengths Though it may not necessarily look like it based on her raw numbers alone McWilliams can definitely rebound. At 5-foot-10-inches she is one of the biggest guards on the roster and can dominate the glass on both ends when matched up against other smaller guards or small forwards.  Now as a senior McWilliams will also be forced to step up as a leader of the team and should see a major spike in minutes on the floor with top rebounders Sydney Wood Courtney Shaw and Jillian Brown all gone from the squad.  Similarly McWilliams will be of major value to coach McKeown as a player who is extremely versatile on the defensive end. Once again her size is valuable because it allows her to be an effective defender both in the post and from the perimeter.  Unlike most guards who are almost always at the mercy of a bigger power forward or center when caught defending in the post area McWilliams can hold her own. Her defensive ability though it may not show up on many areas of the stat sheet could potentially be critical to Northwestern’s defensive effectiveness this upcoming season.  Weaknesses On the simplest level McWilliams needs to be more efficient on the offensive side of the ball. The poor shooting splits she has sported in each of her first three collegiate seasons have not been up to par.  Though there likely won’t be any expectation for her to carry the load scoring-wise McWilliams will still need to be a solid contributor to the Wildcats’ scoring attack which finished second-to-last in the conference a season ago. As a team Northwestern has to improve its offense if the Wildcats hope to improve on their 9-21 record from last year meaning each and every player will have to play their part McWilliams included.  Expectations This season could go a lot of different ways for McWilliams but one sure thing is a much more active role on both sides of the ball. Expect a stark increase in minutes per game especially earlier on in the season as the Wildcats attempt to find their team identity. Though there probably won’t exactly be a gap at the position which McWilliams will be playing this year her role will definitely be defined within their first few weeks of play.  Alongside an increase in minutes expect an increase in all of her major statistics including a rise in her assist numbers which were already solid despite her limited playing time. Being one of just three seniors on the current roster above all McWilliams will need to be a vocal leader and the rock of this Northwestern team. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story We’re creeping toward the halfway point of the NFL season and our former ‘Cats are continuing to put on a show for their teams. Let’s take a look at the best performances from NU alumni this week. Rashawn Slater: Los Angeles Chargers OT Slater had a decent outing in the Chargers’ 31-17 loss against the Chiefs avoiding penalties after getting flagged twice last week. However the All-Pro tackle gave up his first sack of the season as Kansas City put Justin Herbert on the ground five times.  Slater still had his share of solid plays including a crucial block that opened a lane for a 49-yard Joshua Kelley rushing TD that tied the game in the second quarter. He finished with a PFF grade of 75.2 good for third-best among the Chargers’ offense. Slater should have an easier time keeping Herbert upright against the Bears who are second-to-last in the NFL with 10 sacks. Week Eight matchup: vs. Chicago Bears (Sunday 7:20 p.m. CT) Anthony Walker Jr.: Cleveland Browns LB Walker Jr. was an iron man in Cleveland’s 39-38 victory in Indianapolis playing all 70 defensive snaps in his return from a concussion. He was all over the field recording eight combined tackles and recovering a Gardner Minshew fumble in the first quarter. Walker also got his hands on a pass but couldn’t bring it in for what could have been his first interception of the season. The usually stout Browns defense was able to hold on despite allowing over 450 total yards to the Colts. Walker had a huge role in making sure they kept their heads up in an exhausting shootout against his former team. He will look to disrupt Geno Smith’s rhythm in Seattle during the late Sunday slate. Week Eight matchup: at Seattle Seahawks (Sunday 3:05 p.m. CT) Greg Newsome II: Cleveland Browns CB After a shocking upset against the 49ers last week Newsome and the Browns crashed back to Earth in Indianapolis. They were able to take the win but it wasn’t pretty for a Cleveland defense that has been so dominant all season. Newsome recorded three combined tackles two of them solo and played 69 of 70 defensive snaps.  Newsome almost let the game slip out of his hands in the fourth quarter. He allowed Michael Pittman Jr. to wriggle free for a 75-yard touchdown giving the Colts a 38-33 lead with less than six minutes to go. Cleveland escaped with the win but Newsome must clean up his tackling against the Seahawks’ savvy receivers. Week Eight matchup: at Seattle Seahawks (Sunday 3:05 p.m. CT) Dean Lowry: Minnesota Vikings DE Lowry played his best game of the year during the Vikings’ assertive 22-17 victory against the Niners on Monday night. He saw the field for a season-high 75% of Minnesota’s defensive snaps and recorded three combined tackles. Most importantly Lowry recovered his first fumble since Week Seven of the 2021 season setting the Vikings up for an 89-yard drive that ended in a touchdown. Everything seemed to go right for Minnesota’s defense and Lowry’s performance was no exception. The eight-year veteran will look to capitalize on this newfound momentum against his former team at Lambeau Field. Week Eight matchup: at Green Bay Packers (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Godwin Igwebuike: Pittsburgh Steelers RB Igwebuike is a new addition to the column after bouncing around the Falcons’ and Steelers’ practice squads. Pittsburgh called him up after cutting kick returner Gunner Olszewski who fumbled in each of the two games he appeared in this season.  His one opportunity came in the Steelers’ last possession of the half where he returned a kickoff for 15 yards. Igwebuike will likely see more action fielding kicks going forward continuing with a daunting game against the 5-2 Jaguars. Week Eight matchup: vs. Jacksonville Jaguars (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Earnest Brown IV: Los Angeles Rams DE Brown IV was relatively quiet during the Rams’ 24-17 loss to the Steelers. He assisted on one tackle for his lone contribution but played a season-high 13 defensive snaps. With starting defensive lineman Bobby Brown III out for the next few weeks Brown IV could continue to see more action on the field.

The 22nd-ranked Wildcats continued their great play with a second place finish.  With four of the top seven teams in the country participating (Stanford Oregon Texas and UCLA) Northwestern had to bring its best to continue its good play. The team started off the tournament with a 1-over par 285 good enough for fifth place after round one. Junior Lauryn Nguyen and senior Jennifer Cai were the only players for Northwestern to shoot under par for the day. Both players posted 1-under par to lead the ‘Cats.  Outside of Lauryn Nguyen the second round proved to be more difficult than the first. Cai sophomore Dianna Lee first-year Ashley Yun and senior Jieni Li all shot over par on day two. However because of the brilliance of Nguyen the team was able to improve on their day one score with a 1-under 283 in round two. Nguyen carded a bogey-free 5-under par round and Northwestern maintained fifth place going into the final round. The ‘Cats began the third and final round five shots back of USC. They moved up the leaderboard throughout the day with all five players converting at least three birdies. Yun led the way with a 3-under par 68 that included an eagle on the par-5 12th hole. The team finished with a 2-under 282 in the final round. USC closed with a 4-under 280 winning the tournament. The Wildcats’ good day led to a solo second place finish four shots ahead of third place occupied by first-ranked Stanford and 27th ranked California. As for the individuals Nguyen led Northwestern at 4-under par. In her first round Nguyen shot a 1-under 70 highlighted by a stretch of three birdies in four holes from 12 through 15. Round two was Nguyen’s best 18 holes of the tournament shooting a 5-under par 66. It tied the best round of any player in the event and Nguyen took a one shot lead in the individual event going into the final round. Although she didn’t play her best in the last 18 holes shooting 2-over Nguyen finished in a tie for fifth at 4-under par. Nguyen continued her good play at the Stanford Intercollegiate and it was her second top-five finish in her last three tournaments.  Jennifer Cai also had a terrific tournament and finished at 1-under par. In round one Cai made three birdies along with two bogeys to shoot a 1-under par 70. Cai shot a 1-over 72 in the second round. In her final round Cai posted a 1-under 70 after finishing her round 3-under in her last four holes. Cai made one of Northwestern’s tournament-leading three eagles at the par-5 1st hole. She finished at 1-under par overall and in a tie for 11th place. Ashley Yun secured a top-25 finish after her strong play in the tournament. She started off with a 2-over par 73 in round one including three birdies in a row from holes 10 through 12. In round two Yun shot 2-over for the second straight day. In the final round Yun made five birdies and an eagle shooting 3-under 68. She finished at 1-over in the tournament in a tie for 22nd. Jieni Li and Dianna Lee also competed in the tournament with Li finishing in a tie for 35th and Lee tying for 53rd. Li made six birdies in the final round and shot an even-par 71 for the day and 4-over in the tournament. Lee had two birdies and an eagle in her final round. She shot 2-over in her last 18 holes and finished at 7-over par for the tournament. The ‘Cats will have four months off before competing in the UCF Challenge beginning Feb. 4. In its last three tournaments Northwestern has finished second third and second and the Wildcats will look to continue their good play in Orlando. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Welcome back to the film room everybody. If you read any of these pieces last season you came to know the phrase “burn the tape”; well we are running it back because for the first time this season Northwestern’s offense needs to burn the tape from its game against Nebraska. The ‘Cats fell short in Lincoln 17-9 despite the defense forcing two turnovers. It was a story that has plagued Northwestern for years: good defense but inept offense leading to defeat. With starting QB Ben Bryant sidelined for a second straight game NU’s offense was led by junior Brendan Sullivan.  It was another poor showing for the junior although the rest of the offense did not help its quarterback in any shape or form. The offense consistently shot itself in the foot crossing into opponent territory seven times yet coming away without a touchdown. To be polite Mike Bajakian’s group has work to do. Alas before I go into a tirade about tight end and offensive line penalties let’s dive into how the ‘Cats’ backup fared against the Cornhuskers. The Numbers The eye test from Saturday did not align with the stats. Sullivan finished the game 12-for-23 for 176 yards and an interception. His 52% completion rate is the worst of any start of his career and his performance earned him a 43.2 PFF passing grade another career low in his starts. In the first half Sullivan only had 10 yards through the air including a six-yard pass to Joseph Himon in the final seconds of the half. According to PFF Sullivan had one big time throw but had two turnover-worthy plays. On the ground No. 6 added 35 yards on three carries. As if it is already not hard enough to play quarterback Sullivan had defenders in his face all day. He was pressured on 55.9% of dropbacks and was sacked eight times. On his 19 dropbacks under pressure he only attempted nine passes although he did complete five of them. However even when the pocket was clean Sullivan struggled. The ‘Cats’ signal-caller completed only 50% of his passes with no pressure racking up a meager 50 yards. Nebraska brought a blitz nearly three-fourths of the time so it is no wonder why the junior felt heat throughout the game. Outside of two big plays Sullivan kept the ball close to the line of scrimmage. Sure Northwestern did not give him much time to get the ball down the field but the Michigan native played conservatively. Here is a breakdown of all of Sullivan’s throws against Nebraska. To be honest I’ve never seen stats more poorly reflect the tape than this stat line. So without further ado let’s dive into the tape. The Good This will be a more abbreviated section than normal because there was not much good from this past weekend. However there were some positive moments throughout the game. Sullivan has shown throughout his career the ability to fit balls in tight windows. It was no different on Saturday when he made a couple of throws that made me go wow. This was the best throw not only of Sullivan’s season but of his career as a Wildcat. The offensive line fails to pick up the blitzer leaving him with a clear path to the quarterback. Another Husker beats an O-lineman inside and the junior feels the heat instantly. Instead of bailing out of the pocket as he usually does Sullivan steps up and resets his feet. Once he is set he uncorks a bomb down the sideline as he is about to be popped to hit Bryce Kirtz in stride for a 66-yard gain. To get the ball down the field that far is impressive but to drop it in perfectly is a whole other level. Yes the flick is incredible but it was the way Sullivan stepped up — not out — of the pocket that made me smirk. It is a small improvement but one that did not happen against Howard. It’s the next step in his development but it is good to see the pocket presence slowly coming along. Watching this play from the press box it looked like Sullivan badly underthrew A.J. Henning; however the tape said otherwise. As soon as Sullivan finished the play fake he had two defenders barreling down on him because the offensive line could not hold up. With Huskers in his face the junior had no time to set his feet and threw off his back foot. Even with no base Sullivan flicked his wrist and got the ball to Henning for a 32-yard gain.  There is no doubt that Sullivan has a cannon of an arm and he can make some throws that lead fans and coaches to believe that he can be a viable Big Ten quarterback. The Bad It was almost all bad for Northwestern’s offense in Lincoln. The ‘Cats had nine third-and-long situations and NU was constantly going backward. It was not all on the quarterback but he certainly didn’t help at times. One of the main criticisms of Sullivan’s play is his inability to get through his reads or make the correct read. On Saturday this same problem came back to bite Northwestern. Two plays made me lose my mind in the press box on Saturday; this was one of them. This is a walk-in touchdown if Sullivan just makes the right read. Marshall Lang comes across the formation pre-snap and the Wildcats move to a bunch set. This is a classic pick play with Thomas Gordon and Bryce Kirtz clearing out the defenders. Because Nebraska is in man coverage the defender gets into the wash and Lang is left wide open in the flat.  To be honest I don’t know what Sullivan was doing. Lang is the primary read here as the other two are trying to clear Nebraska out. This ball should be out instantly; instead he doesn’t throw the ball and takes a sack.  His eyes dart to the middle of the field first which makes no sense and he never even sees Lang wide open. Even from the press box I’m practically yelling “Lang is open!” NU only came away with three points on this drive when it should have been at least six.  To be a Big Ten quarterback the easy plays have to be easy. The Cornhuskers gave Northwestern free points but Sullivan’s inability to go through his progression pre-snap cost NU a touchdown. You may be asking yourself “Why is a second-down incompletion on here?” Well it is here because this is a decision Sullivan can’t make based on down and distance. It is second-and-10 so the goal is to make it a third-and-manageable. This is also not a good play call from Bajakian pushing every receiver 15 yards down the field. Despite the poor call Sullivan has to understand that throwing a deep ball with a low chance of completion puts NU in a bad spot on third down. Playing QB at the Big Ten level  understanding basics such as down and distance has to come naturally. Sullivan is still struggling mentally to do the fundamentals correctly. Even in minuscule snaps like this play there is a larger underlying concept that he still is not grasping. Another week another rendition of Sullivan leaving the pocket for no reason. Nebraska only rushes three and NU’s offensive line picks it up with ease. This is a clean pocket yet Sullivan bails out and scrambles not getting even close to the first down marker. There is no reason to scramble here; in fact it is the opposite of what he should do. He needs to step up and has plenty of time to set his feet and find a receiver. He never even goes through his progression failing to work the backside of this read. These are the Sullivan plays that drive me insane because he has shown how good he can be when he steps up in the pocket (see the bomb to Kirtz) but continually makes the same mistakes. Sure Northwestern’s offensive line was bad but Sullivan often puts the unit in tough spots. At the Power Five  level a quarterback has to be able to stand in the pocket and deliver a strike play-in and play-out. So far Sullivan has yet to prove he can do that. Sullivan may have only had one turnover on an end-of-half Hail Mary but the junior gave the ‘Huskers multiple opportunities to take the ball away.  Sullivan got lucky here. On the second offensive snap he drops back and locks eyes on Kirtz immediately. Everyone on the field knew where he wanted to go with the ball allowing the corner to break on the ball and jump the route. The defender read No. 6 like a book and should have taken this back for six. The Wildcats were fortunate that the ball went right through the corner’s hands; otherwise they could have been staring out a quick 7-0 hole.  This is a problem we have seen from Sullivan throughout his career. He tends to not go through his progression instead showing where he wants to go with the ball; it allows defenses to make plays on the ball. He may have survived this mistake but teams will capitalize if he continues to put the ball up for grabs. CATCH. THE. DAMN. BALL. Quarterback 101 is catching the snap before anything else. Jackson Carsello puts it on his numbers and Sullivan just drops it because he’s starting his drop before the ball even gets there. This is the first offensive play one right after the defense forced a turnover and Sullivan had the ‘Cats going backward already because of a basic mistake. If you want to see the epitome of Northwestern’s game against Nebraska look no further than the first offensive snap of the game. NU constantly shot itself in the foot because it couldn’t do the fundamentals correctly. Final Thoughts Rewatching this game was frustrating because the Wildcats had so many opportunities to win yet continued to get in their own way. Sullivan was not good but he had no help around him. Bajakian kept trying to stretch the field while Kurt Anderson’s unit was walloped up front. Something needs to change on the offensive side of the ball and that includes better play out of the QB.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Striving for back-to-back championships Northwestern field hockey trailed North Carolina for most of the 2022 title game but in a speck of hope tied the game with just two minutes left in regulation. What seemed to be a confidence booster for the ‘Cats and momentum-killer for the Tar Heels was short-lived. Thirty-nine seconds later North Carolina scored. “At the end of the day we didn’t bring any hardware home” graduate student Alia Marshall said Wednesday. “I don’t dwell on it but it is a constant reminder of what’s at stake and the goals we want to achieve.”  For the ‘Cats last year’s loss is irrelevant. Everything that isn’t this team is.  “Our motto is W.I.N. What’s important now” Marshall said. “We really like to focus on the practice in front of us the drill in front of us and the game in front of us.” What’s important now is the regular-season Big Ten title that Northwestern will play for on Thursday against No. 7 Maryland. The ‘Cats clinched a share of it against No. 4 Rutgers in a game that went into double overtime and then shootouts marking their first regular-season conference crown since 2013. “That’s not enough for us” senior Lauren Wadas said. “We want to have the whole thing.” A decade ago this standard of excellence wasn’t necessarily tangible. From 1995 to 2018 the Wildcats only qualified for the NCAA Tournament in 2014 and 2017. Before the current state of the program the prime of Northwestern field hockey was in the 1980s and 90s and it never made it past the Final Four. Today though the Wildcats are national champions who have qualified for the NCAA Tournament in their last four seasons. Today NU is the best team in the nation and has won 15 games in a row.  ""Marshall Wadas graduate student Peyton Halsey and senior goalie Annabel Skubisz are key facilitators of the program’s growth. Playing alongside one of the sport’s greatest players in Bente Baekers they were all part of Northwesterns first championship appearance and first national tile and have gathered postseason experience in each season. This year they continue to help the ‘Cats dominate. "" Halsey leads the team in goals with 10 including the game-winner over Rutgers. Marshall is a lethal passer with 15 assists and is a pivotal part of the ‘Cats’ efficient corners as the primary inserter. Wadas is an incredibly versatile player on both sides of the field who has added 14 points on offense. Skubisz is arguably the best goalie in the country and has the third-best save percentage across Division I field hockey at .857.  But it isn’t just the veterans making the difference. They have contributed to making Northwestern field hockey a highly esteemed program but they have also paved a culture that allows young and new talent to shine. “Our leaders do a great job of we call it ‘pop-up leadership’ where anybody leads at any time” head coach Tracey Fuchs said. “The quicker you can make your first-years feel comfortable the more impact they’ll have on the field.” Northwestern’s newcomers have done just that. Fuchs brought in Max Field Hockey Player of the Year Olivia Bent-Cole and highly touted Netherlands product Ilse Tromp as well as Richmond graduate transfer Lindsey Frank who Fuchs says is called “grandma” by the two first-years in the trio that they compose.  Bent-Cole already has amassed eight goals and 19 points on the season. With experience at multiple positions Tromp is helpful as a back but has also shown a strong shooting ability especially on corners. “[Bent-Cole and Tromp] came in with no egos as well as the rest of the freshman just wanting to fit it” Skubisz said. “I think that’s another staple of our team. It really is a level playing field and there’s mutual respect across the team going up and down which is really unique.” Playing with an expectation of being No. 1 demands perfection but from the first-years to the graduate students there is a common understanding that it’s okay to make mistakes. Everyone believes in each other “to get the job done” as Halsey said. Northwestern is capable of going undefeated in the Big Ten. It’s capable of a deep postseason run. It’s capable of being the last team standing. At the end of the day however what’s most important to the Wildcats is playing with each other. “I can confidently say that winning makes everything worth it” Skubisz said. “But practice day-to-day is just as fun as the games which I’m really proud that the team has gotten to a point where that’s the truth.” \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story As we head into the weekend before Halloween Northwestern will look to get its season back on track against a scary Maryland team. For the ‘Cats there are more questions than answers including the status of Ben Bryant and the potency of the defense which stepped up last week even as the offense took a step backward. So heading into Saturday here are three reasons why Northwestern will shock Maryland and three reasons why UMD will overpower the ‘Cats for a second consecutive year. \nWhy Northwestern will beat Maryland\n A Strong ‘Cats Defense Last weekend’s defeat had one silver lining for Northwestern: a much-improved defensive performance. The ‘Cats held Nebraska to 17 points keeping the Huskers to just 248 yards from scrimmage. They also limited Heinrich Haarberg to only 85 passing yards alongside two interceptions and a sub-50% completion rate. This performance marks vast development for a lagging Northwestern defense which has been near the back of the pack in the Big Ten this year. Another strong showing could prove pivotal for the Wildcats against Maryland. Holding Nebraska to such a bare stat line is an encouraging start and should only serve to motivate this Northwestern defense to come out aggressively this week. The Terps have an explosive offense and stopping it could open the door for the ‘Cats to swing the momentum in their favor and outduel them.  Ben Bryant’s Potential Return The word “potential” is italicized and for good reason. Ben Bryant was ruled out only a matter of hours before kickoff. At Monday afternoon’s press conference David Braun struck a more cautious tone saying that the graduate quarterback will return “at some point this season.” If Bryant comes back this week the ‘Cats’ offense should receive a boost. The unit was dormant last weekend scoring only nine points and failing to capitalize on a myriad of scoring opportunities. Bryant has proven his resilience on numerous occasions and has separated himself as the starter above Brendan Sullivan who has been lackluster in his past two starts. Should Bryant start Northwestern’s offense should be able to get something going and maybe do just enough to best the Terps; defense. Home-Field Advantage Indeed I’m not too optimistic about NU’s prospects against Maryland so I’ll give the Ryan Field faithful a shout here. The ‘Cats have played decently at home registering a respectable 3-1 record in Evanston so far. I don’t entirely know if this is an advantage as much as it is Northwestern playing well against inferior competition but the results are telling nonetheless. The Terrapins are a more challenging opponent than the three teams the ‘Cats have bested so this might be a bit of a stretch. Yet this Maryland team fell short against a considerably weaker Illinois in College Park two weeks ago so anything is possible. Especially given that Maryland is playing this game on the road perhaps there is a chance for the “Home-Field Advantage” to strike once again. \nWhy Northwestern won’t beat Maryland\n Quarterback Qualms As much as Northwestern fans root for Sullivan to succeed it’s been hard to find satisfaction with his performances thus far. The Howard game was too close for comfort with Sullivan’s performance nearly driving the ‘Cats to a catastrophic FCS loss. Last week was simply a repeat of that showing with the Sullivan-led offense proving inept at delivering when the opportunities repeatedly presented themselves. Given Braun’s noncommittal remarks I’d go into this game assuming it will again be Sullivan at the helm. That is worrisome and could make victory against the Terps even more of an uphill climb. With Bryant under center I see this game as a contest that favors Maryland but will be hard-fought. As for Sullivan the game feels unwinnable with him starting and could end in a result that mirrors Penn State’s blowout slightly less than a month ago. Inadequate Pass Protection I won’t be the first to say it but Northwestern’s offensive line was horrendous against Nebraska. The line collectively allowed eight sacks the most allowed by a Northwestern team since 2000. To make matters worse the ‘Cats have permitted 30 sacks through their first seven games this season averaging more than four per game.  Against a robust Maryland front seven this offensive line could be in for a long afternoon. The stats indicate that the Terrapins are a slightly worse defensive team than Nebraska but that shouldn’t make too much of a difference. They can still tear down Northwestern’s offensive line and leave Sullivan helpless. Don’t bet on another eight-sack affair because that should realistically never happen. However with the state of this offensive line nothing is out of the question. An Explosive Maryland Pass Attack Watch out for senior quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa. Even though the ‘Cats’ defense largely held Haarberg in check Tagovailoa is a different beast. He’s not necessarily his brother (who’s currently a frontrunner for NFL MVP) but he still has plenty of ability as a signal-caller. Many experts see him as a mid-to-late Day Three NFL Draft selection further indicating his breadth of talent. The performance of Tagovailoa often dictates Maryland’s entire offense which has been overwhelmingly successful through seven games this season. The loss to Illinois was an anomaly as Tagovailoa had his second-worst QBR rating of the season at 70.2 — a number that isn’t bad in the first place. Expect him to bounce back this week against the ‘Cats and potentially give Northwestern’s defense a few too many headaches.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Next up on our player previews is grad transfer Ryan Langborg who enters Evanston with the chance to contribute immediately for the Wildcats after a stellar career with Princeton. Who he is Graduate student; 6-foot-4; from San Diego California; Princeton transfer 2022-2023 stats (at Princeton) 32 games (32 starts) 31.3 minutes per game 12.7 points per game 3.1 rebounds per game 1.6 assists per game 0.6 blocks per game 0.8 steals per game 42.3% FG 33.2% 3P 82.3% FT 2022-2023 review Last season for the Tigers Langborg produced one of his most impressive seasons helping to lead Princeton to a magical Sweet Sixteen run. During the regular season Langborg was Princeton’s second-leading scorer as he played a career-high in minutes. Langborg also produced career bests in blocks and free throw attempts. While his efficiency dropped off slightly his overall shooting splits remained solid. Some might gripe that playing in the Ivy League leads to a lower level of competition but Langborg was at his best when the lights were brightest. After a lackluster opening round against Arizona in the NCAA Tournament Langborg found his rhythm in the Round of 32 to the tune of 22 points six rebounds and four assists against Mizzou. This explosion was no one-off though: in the Sweet Sixteen Langborg scored 26 points on 64.7% shooting as the Tigers were ultimately bounced by Creighton.  Strengths Langborg’s greatest asset is his range. The grad transfer is a bonafide deep threat who can thrive both off the dribble and in catch-and-shoot situations. Princeton was able to get Langborg open looks off screens and his range extends several feet past the three-point line. Even if his percentage was slightly lower a season ago his 40.5% three-point clips in 2021-22 shows why Langborg could be one of the most efficient long-ball shooters in all of the Big Ten. Langborg is effective both on and off the ball and is a pretty active mover offensively. His veteran savvy shows up a handful of times each games. He won’t blow you away in any one category but Langborg often makes contributions across the box score: he is a willing rebounder solid passer and high-effort defender who will often corral a steal or block.  Langborg also has a ton of experiences after three years of Ivy League play. On top of that he has deeper NCAA Tournament experience than any other player on Northwestern’s roster. With the loss of Chase Audige Langborg is the type of player who will be needed for his ability to get a bucket both from long range and via drives to the basket. Weaknesses If I ended the strengths section by comparing Langborg’s bucket-getting ability to Audige it would be unfair to not mention that Langborg is not the same type of player as Audige nor should he be expected to be. It shouldn’t come as much of surprise to state that Langborg is not the same defensive presence as last year’s Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year. Langborg has adequate size and is a scrappy defender but he can look out of place against bigger guards. Overall Langborg is a very good free throw shooter making his attempts at a career rate of 82.1%. Dig a little deeper and an odd quirk is exposed. Last season Langborg was a near-automatic 92.7% from the stripe in home games. But on the road that number plummets to 69.4%. His numbers from 2021-22 also show a significant drop in this home-away split (87.0% to 72.2%). In a Big Ten conference that features some of the most hostile arenas in all of college basketball Langborg’s road woes are worth keeping an eye on even if it’s a niche stat. Expectations Langborg should be in the rotation right away. There’s a chance he could be in the starting lineup if Chris Collins opts for a small lineup of Buie-Langborg-Berry-Barnhizer-Nicholson. I think more likely we see Langborg as one of the first off the bench. Either way Langborg will get playing time early and often. Northwestern will count on Langborg for his scoring prowess especially from deep. Is there a chance Langborg finishes the season as NU’s second-leading scorer behind only Buie? I’d say it’s unlikely but there is a nonzero chance. He immediately becomes a premier deep threat for a Northwestern team that finished 12th in the conference in both three-point percentage and total scoring and dead last in overall field goal percentage. It’s safe to expect a few heat check games from Langborg where he finds fire and puts up scoring outputs in the high-teens or twenties. With both Langborg and the Northwestern team having gotten a taste of March Madness a year ago there will be ample motivation to return to postseason play while the team’s window remains open. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After reaching the semifinals of last year’s Big Ten Women’s Soccer Tournament the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament and being voted as the preseason second-best team in the conference Northwestern’s season has presumably already come to an end — before the start of the 2023 postseason. The Wildcats missed the cut for this year’s conference playoff competition by finishing tied for ninth in the standings at 3-5-2; Iowa at 3-4-3 notched the eighth and final berth in the Big Ten Tournament. Entering their last two games of the season the ‘Cats had a fighting chance to sneak into the back end of playoff play sitting at 2-4-1 with contests left against Minnesota and Rutgers. However the team split the pair of games which was insufficient to earn a coveted spot. On Thursday from a rainy Evanston NU closed out its home season in Martin Stadium against the Golden Gophers. Despite struggling early against UMN’s frenetic play the Wildcats eventually persevered and cut through. Caterina Regazzoni got Michael Moynihan’s side on the board at the 11:46 mark of the first half giving Northwestern a 1-0 lead at the break. Then the Wildcats contributed two more in the second frame courtesy of a header from Emma Phillips and a last-minute tack-on shot from Josie Aulicino. Meg Boade notched two more assists while Reiley Fitzpatrick didn’t allow a goal despite 14 Minnesota shots and 10 corner kicks. Following the conclusion of its home slate with a victory Northwestern ventured to Piscataway New Jersey to battle the Rutgers Scarlet Knights on Sunday. RU got on the board first courtesy of Sara Brocious a 1-0 score which held until halftime. After the respite Aulicino answered by tying the game on her sixth goal of the season. But the purple momentum halted there. Ashley Baran deposited one at the 76:17 point putting the home side ahead. The ‘Cats couldn’t convert their lone shot attempt subsequent to that and fell in New Jersey 2-1. Collectively Northwestern ended 9-5-4 a bit of a far cry from its 16-5-2 and stellar 7-2-1 conference record last season. The Wildcats never truly looked the part of a dominant team once they hit Big Ten play as a five-game stretch without a win proved fateful. NU’s Big Ten Tournament miss proved the second time in three seasons that the purple and white did not qualify for the competition. Considering that the team returned most of its core roster and star power it’s difficult to consider 2023 as anything other than a letdown a consecutive trip to the NCAA Tournament incredibly unlikely. With mainstays Aurea del Carmen and Danika Austin having utilized their last year of eligibility — and Aulicino Boade Ella Hase and Nicole Doucette just wrapping up their senior campaigns — considerable uncertainty may lie ahead for Moynihan’s program. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After a crushing 17-9 loss in Nebraska last weekend Northwestern looks to bounce back when it welcomes the Maryland Terrapins into Ryan Field on Saturday. The Terps have lost their last two but head to Evanston just one win away from bowl eligibility. To prepare for the ‘Cats’ upcoming matchup Inside NU spoke with WMUC’s Henry Lilienfeld to fill us on everything we need to know about Maryland. Inside NU:  Maryland has lost its last two after winning its first five games of the season. What has gone wrong over the last two weeks and do you have concerns about the rest of the season? Henry Lilienfield: After starting the season 5-0 for the first time since 2001 the Terps had high hopes going into the Ohio State game in Columbus. Leading 17-10 midway through the third quarter with the defense playing lights out there was a sense that this was the year to really make a statement; that sense was wrong. For the remainder of the contest the Terps got overpowered Taulia Tagovailoa was horrible and it resulted in a lopsided loss. The following week Maryland looked to bounce back with a win over a desperate Illinois team. In a back-and-forth battle the Fighting Illini pulled off the upset with a game-winning field goal as time expired.  That game was a bit different than the loss to the Buckeyes though. It was much more of a team loss: not solely on the offense not solely on the defense. With that said even though there weren’t specific plays to look back on and think that’s the reason Maryland lost there were definitely routine opportunities to make plays and the team just didn’t execute.  Even after two disappointing losses there isn’t good reason to panic just yet. These last two games weren’t necessarily a fluke because the Terrapins lost as a heavy underdog to Ohio State and to a pesky Illinois group but there also isn’t much of a reason to be concerned. The Terps can become bowl-eligible for three straight seasons with a single win the first time since 2006-08 and have five games left to solidify another successful season.  INU: Taulia Tagovailoa has improved a lot since he last took on NU in 2020. How would you evaluate his performance this season? Lilienfeld: Overall Taulia Tagovailoa has been good. The senior ranks second in the Big Ten in passing yards passing touchdowns and completion percentage. He also has the most completed passes in the Big Ten.  Tagovailoa has been solid in six of seven games this season with the lone dud being Ohio State. Excluding that game you could make the case that he is at the top of the list of quarterbacks in the conference. However you can’t just forget about a two-interception game with under 200 yards through the air. The word to describe Tagovailoa is inconsistent but Terps fans know what he has done for the program and will always have his back.  INU: Last season Roman Hemby ran for 179 yards and three touchdowns against Northwestern. How has he done this season and is he likely to recreate this type of game on Saturday? Lilienfeld: Hemby has been quieter than expected thus far. After leading the Terps’ backfield last season the running back earned his Big Ten All-Conference Honorable Mention accolade to finish out the year. Despite high hopes coming into the season the redshirt sophomore has declined in production. Hemby no longer gets goal-line carries and has seen his touches decrease a pretty substantial amount.  Antwain Littleton II has taken on the workload this season due to his north-south style of play and head coach Mike Locksley seems content with the way the backfield is operating. Expect Hemby to get his fair share of touches on Saturday but I wouldn’t count on another career day for the Baltimore native.  INU: Maryland’s defense already has nine interceptions this season. What makes the secondary so dangerous? Lilienfeld: After seeing their two best cornerbacks Jakorian Bennett and Deonte Banks leave for the National Football League the Terps knew they’d have to rely on their veterans in the secondary. Maryland returned both of their starting safeties this season senior Beau Brade and junior Dante Trader Jr. and the duo have done a phenomenal job anchoring the defensive unit.  Maryland has lots of confidence in their cornerbacks too. Tarheeb Still ranks second in the Big Ten in interceptions with three even after missing two games. The senior moved outside after playing nickel corner during the first few years of his college career. Ja’Quan Sheppard mans the other side of the field and the transfer from Cincinnati has done a nice job settling in with the defense and has given the team some added protection in the back end. Maryland plays a bend but doesn’t break style of play on the defensive side and the secondary has a lot to do with it.  INU: What does Maryland need to do to break its two-game losing streak on Saturday and what is your score prediction? Lilienfeld: Maryland needs to play Maryland football if it wants to leave Evanston with a win on Saturday against Northwestern. In games when they play their brand of football the Terps usually come out victorious but they tend to play down to worse teams and it ends up haunting them.  Taulia Tagovailoa needs to take care of the ball and let his playmakers make plays and the defense has to make the Wildcats methodically drive down the field earning every yard.  If Maryland plays up to their potential it will win and even if it doesn’t I think the Terps still win. My final score prediction is 30-17 Maryland.         \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story When the halftime whistle blew during Northwestern’s Thursday field hockey matchup against Maryland it was facing what many would call a first-world problem. Northwestern was up by two goals. Senior goalie Annabel Skubisz was proving why she was the reigning Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week by thwarting most of Maryland’s attempts to find the back of the net tallying a game-high five saves in the second quarter. And yet the Wildcats weren’t satisfied.  But if you looked beyond the surface you could see why.  To start the game the Wildcats scored a whopping three goals in 16 minutes. Fifth-year Linsdey Frank found the back of the net eight minutes into the game by virtue of an assist from Lauren Wadas recording her first goal of the season. Four minutes later another fifth-year scored: this time it was Alia Marshall who sprinted down from midfield and got past three different defenders to tack on another point for her team. “I got the ball in the middle of the field and I was looking for my teammates” Marshall said of her goal. “(Maryland’s) defenders jumped on my teammates which left the center open for me to do quick little pulls and then just a nice little finish over the goalie.” ""...and Alias   pic.twitter.com/cKsMQ4mudm"" A minute into the second quarter Marshall contributed once again completing a long pass to fifth-year and team goal-scoring leader Peyton Halsey that led to Halsey’s 11th goal of this season. However the rest of that quarter felt like an offensive momentum halt for the Wildcats. In that second quarter Maryland scored in that quarter to turn the score from 3-0 to 3-1 and outshot the Wildcats 9-7. Out of the seven shots that NU made four of them were stopped by Maryland goalie Alyssa Kebasko. In other words a game that was once dominated by Northwestern suddenly felt winnable for the Terrapins. But given the mindset that Northwestern entered the game in there was no way it was going to settle for just leading the game. It wanted to have total control. Headed into Thursday’s matchup NU already had a share of the Big Ten regular season title by virtue of its win over Rutgers on Sunday. However as Wadas said before the game against Maryland just getting a share of the title wasn’t enough — it wanted the whole thing. This was a team that settled for nothing less than perfection and that wasn’t going to change after the second quarter. So during halftime head coach Tracey Fuchs knew she needed to make adjustments. And to her adjustments meant having her team put more pressure on the ball. “I thought Maryland had a great second quarter” Fuchs said after the game. “We were sitting back a little bit — we tweaked the way we were pressing their backs. So we pinched in and we really wanted them to play on the outside because we’re really good and swarming and really putting pressure on the ball. Once we got pressure on the ball I thought we did a great job.” To Marshall team changes during halftime were also mental ones. She mentioned the team especially the younger players tends to get frantic when things don’t go its way and she felt it was her role as one of the more experienced players to help snap the team out of panic mode. “The scoreboard makes it seem like we didn’t but there were definitely moments especially in the second quarter when we were under a lot of pressure” Marshall said. “We hadn’t gone to our attacking circle as much as we had in the first quarter so (we found) ways to stay calm cool collected and get back to our tempo play.” And just like that Northwestern was back in its groove during the second half of the game. As Fuchs wanted the team started putting more offensive pressure as Marshall drew a penalty corner 25 seconds into the third quarter. Two minutes later Marshall drew another corner and both she and Lauren Hunter assisted on a goal scored by first-year Ilse Tromp. While the Wildcats’ offense was getting hot the defense didn’t let up in the third quarter either. Maryland failed to score on the two consecutive corners it drew in this quarter with Skubisz saving the first shot and the NU defense blocking the next one. Fuchs credits Northwestern assistant coach Georgia Holland for running and making the team’s corner defense what it is. “You have to be so brave on penalty corner defense — the ball is hard and a little bit bigger than a golf ball” Fuchs said. “Our corner percentage has been amazing all year... kudos to (Holland) and the rest of our staff for a job well done.” The final quarter was the icing on top for the Wildcats. They subbed out several of their starters Skubisz made another save and the Terrapins could not score once again. Junior Regan Cornelius who only came into the game at the end of the third quarter shot from right outside the crease to make the score 5-1 where it would stay for good.  pic.twitter.com/R6ko1Iec3F With this win the Wildcats gained sole possession of the Big Ten regular-season title for the first time since 1994 and finished the season 8-0 in Big Ten regular season play — their first time going undefeated in conference play since 1988. They now head into the Big Ten Tournament as the No. 1 seed for the first time in program history. And to add on their 16-game win streak is the longest they have had since 1990. So yeah that’s a lot of firsts. And those firsts are a further testament to the fact that this year’s Northwestern team doesn’t have a “survive and advance” mentality. It wasn’t only aiming for the grand prize but also every single checkpoint that came along with it. Yes the Wildcats won a national title back in 2021. But this year the team is looking to add every possible accomplishment onto its ever-growing season resume. Simply put this year’s Northwestern field hockey team has a certain spark to it that’s unlike any other that’s been fielded by the program before. “There’s been teams in the past where I’m like ‘Oh are we ready?’” Fuchs said. “This team has been ready since game one. Even in that game we lost we performed okay.” Marshall thinks that the Wildcats are also better from a technical perspective this year. She says that the team retains the same athleticism and speed that they had in years past but now they have more depth. This held true against Maryland where Northwestern had five different goal-scorers for five goals. “We have a lot of people contributing in big ways instead of having a few people doing a lot of big things” Marshall said. Northwestern now has its eyes on next week’s Big Ten Tournament in Ann Arbor Michigan where it will have a first-round bye and start straight from the semifinals. It hasn’t captured a conference tournament crown since 2014 so that will be another item on the team’s bucket list in a season where it seems to be earning everything. For Fuchs the start of the tournament feels like the start of an entirely new season. “Season number two is over” Fuchs said. “We did what we had to do... there’s another trophy up for grabs. That was our goal set out: to vie for regular season vie for [Big Ten] Tournament and then make a run in the NCAA (Tournament). So far we checked all the boxes but season number three starts on Sunday.”      \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story With the women’s basketball exhibition game just next week we’re continuing our player preview series. Next up is Paige Mott who was Northwestern’s third-leading scorer last season behind Caileigh Walsh and Sydney Wood. Who is She? Senior; forward; 6-foot-1; from Philadelphia Pennsylvania 2022-23 stats 30 games 25 starts 23.6 minutes per game; 8.9 points per game; 4.4 rebounds per game; 1.4 assists per game; 52.7% FG%; 58.3% FT% 2022-2023 review Taking on a bigger role last season Mott proved she is a real asset to the team. Playing in every game and starting in 25 of those the forward had doubled her minutes from her sophomore season. With her increase in minutes brought a spike in her scoring as her 8.9 points per game marked a five-point jump from her 2021-22 average. She even had a seven-game stretch of double-digit nights towards the end of the season and dropped 23 points against Wisconsin to lead Northwestern to its road win in Madison. Last season Mott had many firsts and career-breaking games including her first double-double against Duke to open last December. Despite NU’s lackluster season as a team that finished 2-16 in Big Ten play Mott’s impact on the floor only got better as the season went on. So much so she played 36 minutes — the most minutes in her career — in late January at Wisconsin.   Strengths Going into her senior season Mott will be a leader for this team especially as someone with three years of experience. Overall Mott has pulled the ‘Cats out of scoring deficits in multiple games including the game at Nebraska where she helped erase a 10-point first half deficit before the Huskers pulled away. Through the four games in the second half of January the forward scored 15.8 points per contest.  If Mott can keep up the momentum that she had at the end of the season there’s no doubt that she can be the second-best scoring player for Northwestern. As Mott became a regular starter she also became very comfortable scoring in the paint. As a starting forward her ability to drive to the rim is essential to the ‘Cats winning games.  \nWeaknesses  Throughout her career the senior has only attempted six three-pointers. Recently Mott said that she’s been working on that part of her game. Along with her shooting behind the arc if she began free-throw shooting at a higher level Northwestern’s offense could have a better chance at keeping pace with high-octane offenses such as Iowa Maryland and DePaul.  Now an experienced player Mott needs to be more consistent on a game-to-game basis. Only three games apart last season Mott scored 15 points against Maryland and then zero against Purdue. With a team that now has their fair share of upperclassmen it’s important to be prepared to step on the floor at all times.  Expectations This season is the one for Northwestern to prove that they can be competitive in the Big Ten. At Big Ten Media Day Mott specifically emphasized how team culture was a big focus over the summer. Following their work this offseason and with only two seniors and a grad student remaining on the roster No. 20 is expected to step up to the plate as a consistent starter. In terms of her game Mott should focus on improving her three-point shot as well as grabbing more boards each game. Last season she averaged 4.4 rebounds per game. However as the most experienced forward this year Mott should set an example for the younger and newer players. Most importantly Mott needs to make more free throws in the few close games that the Wildcats had the missed free throws would’ve saved them an L on their record. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Now less than two weeks away from tipping off Northwestern women’s basketball has a number of newcomers who can play high-impact roles right away. One of them is Crystal Wang a forward out of Sierra Canyon in California whose versatility could jump off the page right away. Who she is First-year; forward; 6-foot-2; from Beijing China; attended Sierra Canyon HS in Chatsworth California High School Stats 10.2 points per game 5.0 rebounds per game (per Northwestern Athletics) 2022-23 Review Playing a critical role on an absolutely loaded Sierra Canyon team led by USC-bound Juju Watkins the No. 1 recruit in the Class of 2023 Wang enjoyed a stellar senior year. She was the starting small forward of a core that was a consensus top-five team in the nation from wire to wire. The Trailblazers won their first 31 games before losing to Etiwanda in the Southern California Regional Open Division title game by one point. While Watkins and rising senior Mackenly Randolph starred Wang was a two-way player who proved she could step up as a top offensive option against quality competition. Last January Sierra Canyon’s undefeated run appeared to be in jeopardy when Watkins suffered an injury that forced her to miss the team’s opening game in the Mission League an uber-talented conference of Southern California private schools. That didn’t faze Wang who led the Trailblazers with 21 points five rebounds five assists and two steals in a 70-50 win at Harvard-Westlake. She routinely put up multiple-steal games and was a great facilitator from the wing. Because Sierra Canyon had immense offensive talent in Watkins Randolph and Izela Arenas Wang’s primary role was to provide defensive versatility and she did just that. Strengths It’s tough to make a concrete assessment from the sliver of info and film out there but Wang seems to possess a unique set of defensive skills for a 6-foot-2 player. Four of Sierra Canyon’s starters were over six feet tall: Wang Watkins (6-foot-2) Randolph (6-foot) and rising sophomore Emilia Krstevski (6-foot-5). Because of that head coach Alicia Komaki had so much length at her disposal that she often needed Wang to defend wings and guards. The Beijing native really stood out as an off-ball defender with her ability to clog passing lanes. Like Joe McKeown Komaki threw out lots of zone defense. Of course both schemes differ in their intricacies but that similarity could make Wang’s transition to Northwestern smooth. She has experience flying around in rotation to guard both post and perimeter players on the same possession which gives Northwestern a defensive weapon in its frontcourt. Wang’s one inch smaller than Caileigh Walsh but also has the potential to match up with the same players Sydney Wood guarded last year. It’ll be interesting to see how Wang can hold up in isolation but McKeown has a ton to work with. Now on the other end: Again Paige Mott is 6-foot-1 and Walsh is 6-foot-3. Wang is doing this at 6-foot-2. By centering the offense around Walsh’s perimeter scoring last year Northwestern has already taken a big step toward establishing its identity as a team that wants to stretch defenses as much as possible. Wang consistently shot corner-threes and thrived at facilitating off the dribble in Sierra Canyon’s offense. If she can do all that even somewhat consistently in the Big Ten then she will add a new dimension to NU’s offense. McKeown can already play Wang at three or four positions on defense and this amount of offensive versatility would unlock a treasure chest of lineup combinations and sets that he could tinker with. With three players over 6-foot-1 who can play big frontcourt minutes in Wang Walsh and Mott Northwestern can throw out different looks every possession. Maybe those first two players function as perimeter players without the entire defense keying in on them. Maybe they could alternate possessions with a set where one of them forms a duo with Mott in the post while the other stretches the defense off the ball. Who knows?  In other words Wang’s ability to stretch the floor and guard wings doesn’t just give the Wildcats a good two-way player. It also gives McKeown a prime opportunity to deploy Walsh in a myriad of ways to tap into her inside-out scoring prowess with greater efficiency. If everyone’s shooting numbers see some positive regression to stretch the defense even further that could pay off in a huge way for Wang and the entire team. Weaknesses If McKeown does choose to occasionally deploy her as a wing Wang has room to improve as an isolation defender. She isn’t that quick on the ball which is something that Sierra Canyon’s zone and its talented core may have hid. For Northwestern to play Wang at the three defensively — even if it’s just situationally in in the middle quarters — that has to improve. It’s nitpicking especially considering that may not even be her role but developing more on-ball skills could go a long way. Additionally it’ll be interesting to see how Wang’s pace as a creator translates to the Big Ten. Obviously she’s a crafty finisher who confidently commits to her move off the dribble (just watch that clip above again and these highlights). However Wang heavily relies on her finesse and less on her speed to work inside and has benefited from an unclogged paint thanks to the dangerous perimeter scorers around her spacing the floor. Given Northwestern’s top-two returning scorers are paint players Wang could run into some trouble if she needs to create for herself while they’re on the floor. It’s important to note that this is a 6-foot-2 player we’re talking about. These may not even be noticeable weaknesses if McKeown chooses to utilize Wang as a stretch-four who sits in the corner; they would just make it really tough to play her while Mott and Walsh are both on the court. Expectations It didn’t happen last year but McKeown is not afraid to start true first-years. In 2021-22 he penciled in Walsh and Jillian Brown to start immediately. Wang is capable of becoming the next one to do that. Besides Abi Scheid no Northwestern big nor wing in recent memory has possessed Wang’s positional versatility (or at least this much potential to provide it) in both phases. There’s a non-zero chance that she starts at the three in place of Jasmine McWilliams if NU wants to run with a bigger lineup. However because Mott and Walsh are the two best offensive players on the team who should take on the bulk of the frontcourt minutes Wang might begin the season with a lower minute total before gradually working her way up the rotation. Regardless she has the potential to become a crucial piece for the ‘Cats down the stretch. Northwestern a team that struggled mightily with floor-spacing in 2022-23 will rely on Wang’s three-point shooting and playmaking ability to do so.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Following a disappointing 17-9 loss at Nebraska last week NU needed a more encouraging performance against Maryland. The ‘Cats were able to deliver besting one of the more high-powered offenses in the B1G and keeping their bowl hopes alive in a 33-27 win. Here’s the highs and lows from an astounding Northwestern win. Stock Up Sullivan and the NU offense opened the day with an inauspicious four-play drive but they only went up from there. The junior QB led the ‘Cats to the end zone on three consecutive drives in the first quarter. On the second of those drives Sullivan found Bryce Kirtz three times for 51 combined yards the final catch being a 23-yard TD. Sullivan showed off his mobility during their final offensive possession rushing for two first downs. He also completed one of his best balls of the season when he hit Cam Johnson on a 34-yard rainbow down the sideline.  Despite a slow start to the second half Sullivan beat the Maryland blitz and churned out an 18-yard gain in the fourth quarter to cross into enemy territory. On the same drive he uncorked another beautiful 34-yard pass down the middle to A.J. Henning. He hit Joseph Himon II for a 53-yard quick pass on NU’s next possession setting up first-and-goal on a drive that would end in a Jack Olsen field goal. Sullivan finished 16-for-23 with 265 passing yards and two touchdowns in what was indisputably the best game of his career. NU’s defense held the line on two consecutive Maryland drives in the second quarter. They forced a turnover on downs despite the Terrapins threatening to score on the 1-yard line for three plays. On Maryland’s next drive — its last before halftime — Taulia Tagovailoa completed three huge passes to reach NU’s 16-yard line in less than a minute. But the defense didn’t break forcing three incompletions to bring up fourth down and force the Terrapins to settle for a field goal.  The ‘Cats forced another Maryland field goal in the third quarter despite getting pushed to their 3-yard line. NU scored 30 points in the red zone as opposed to Maryland’s 20 as the defense stayed tough against a Terrapins offense with the fourth-most touchdowns in the B1G entering the game. Mueller had one of the most crucial plays of the first half batting a Tagovailoa pass down on fourth-and-goal in the second quarter to force a turnover-on-downs. He also showed up in yet another vital moment in the second half. Mueller sacked Tagovailoa at NU’s 4-yard line to bring up fourth down and force a field goal attempt. Overall Mueller finished with five total tackles one sack and a pass breakup in an impressive showing.  Honorable mentions: Coco Azema Jack Olsen Bryce Kirtz Bryce Gallagher first-quarter offense Stock Down The wind was whipping in Evanston on Saturday afternoon which made for some short kicks and long returns as a result. Braedon Wisloski returned the opening kick to the 34-yard line setting UMD up with decent field position to begin a five-play TD drive. NU also had some crucial penalties that worked against them. An unsportsmanlike conduct on a Northwestern extra point forced a kickoff from their 20-yard line allowing Wisloski to return the ball beyond midfield. That excellent position also resulted in a Maryland TD to Roman Hemby. Maryland started its drives behind the 25-yard line just twice all game as NU’s special teams unit failed to make splash plays. Northwestern must improve its penetration on kickoff returns if they want to take pressure off the defense going forward. The offensive line had difficulties handling Maryland’s D-line all game long. On NU’s opening drive Sullivan was sacked on two consecutive plays as he ran out of time in the pocket. Sullivan was brought down again in the third quarter on 3rd-and-10 forcing a punt. With four minutes in the same quarter the O-line broke down and let Sullivan go down for the fourth sack of the game. In the run game the ‘Cats’ line couldn’t clear many wide-open lanes as Northwestern’s backs averaged just 2.9 yards per carry. Sullivan’s career-best performance could’ve been that much sweeter if the O-line protected him better. Tagovailoa easily maneuvered around NU’s defensive line all game dancing in and out of the pocket. Though the ‘Cats were credited with six sacks most of them came from running Tagovailoa out of bounds behind the line of scrimmage. An exasperating play came in the third quarter when the Maryland QB scampered for a first down on third-and-10. It would’ve been an excellent opportunity to get the defense off the field but they ended up giving up three on that drive.

Share this story Northwestern has found its offense again. Coming off of a nine-point showing on the road the Wildcats (4-4 2-3 B1G) found their form again in Ryan Field in its 33-27 defeat of Maryland (5-3 2-3 B1G). Northwestern totaled 368 yards on offense and scored on seven drives which included six forays into the Maryland red zone.  Brendan Sullivan played the game of his life going 16-for-23 for a total of 265 yards and two touchdowns. He also led the team with 56 yards on the ground. For Maryland Taulia Tagovailoa was splendid in defeat throwing for 274 yards and a trifecta of touchdowns but threw a backbreaking interception with under two minutes to go to end the game.  UMD received the opening kick and after a 26-yard return by Braeden Wisloski to set Maryland up in good field position at its own 34 the Terrapins offense went to work quickly. Tagovailoa completed his first two passes for 14 yards before wide receiver Kaden Prather took an end-around for 36 yards to set Maryland up in the red zone. Two plays later Tagovailoa found Tai Felton in the end zone for an eight-yard score. The drive had covered 66 yards in just five plays. On the ensuing drive. Coco Azema had a nice return of his own to set the Wildcats up just outside their own 25 and the Northwestern offense also got to work quickly. Mike Bajakian also dialed up an end-around this one to AJ Henning and Henning took it for 11 yards and a first down. Unfortunately for Northwestern the Maryland defensive line flexed its muscle and sacked Sullivan twice on the ensuing series to force Hunter Renner to punt.  ""However Sullivan wouldnt have to wait long to get the ball back. An aggressive blitz from the Wildcats pressured Tagovailoa and he ended up losing the ball. Bryce Gallagher cleaned up the mess himself setting up Northwestern inside the Maryland 15 with a great chance to tie up the game. "" ""It was a chance the Wildcats wouldnt squander. Sullivan scrambled for 10 yards nearly taking the entire Maryland defense into the end zone with him before being dragged down at the one-yard line. Cam Porter would finish the job from there diving into the end zone to knot the score up at 7-7 just over six minutes into the game."" Due to an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on the extra point Northwestern kicked off from its own 20. Wisloski ripped off another big return rumbling for 34 yards into Northwestern territory to give his offense prime field position. Maryland played conservatively getting to a third-and-one at Northwestern’s 36. Tagovailoa was able to convert the first down after scrambling on a rollout but then badly underthrew a wide-open Felton on a flea-flicker that probably could have gone for six. He would make up for it three plays later finding Roman Hemby on a beautifully designed screen pass that broke 24 yards for Tagovailoa’s second passing touchdown of the game.  Northwestern’s next drive started with a pair of short runs but the Wildcats were able to moe across midfield after an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Maryland linebacker Fa’Najae Gotay. The Wildcats would get into the red zone after back-to-back completions to Bryce Kirtz and Kirtz would finish the drive off with a beautifully run post route from 23 yards out. Sullivan’s first passing touchdown of the day was perfectly placed and tied the game at 14 with just under three minutes to play in the opening frame. Maryland would again start near midfield after an unnecessary roughness penalty on of all people kicker Henry Helms. The Terrapins were unable to take advantage of the prime position thanks to Northwestern’s run defense holding firm and a third-down Tagovailoa throwaway forced a punt that wound up being downed at the Northwestern 3.  The Wildcats would move out of the shadow of their own goalposts quickly after Sullivan found a wide-open Marshall Lang on a crossing route for a gain of 23 yards. The offensive efficiency continued into the second quarter partially thanks to a late hit on Maryland that pushed the ball inside the Terrapins’ 40. The next play saw Thomas Gordon rumble for 18 yards to put the Wildcats in the red zone for the third time in 16 minutes of game action.  Porter pushed forward for 10 yards to set the ball up at the four but fumbled two plays later. Luckily Northwestern was able to fall on the ball and Porter redeemed himself by catching a shovel pass from Sullivan and taking it into the end zone to give Northwestern the lead with three minutes gone by in the second quarter.  Maryland was nearly forced to punt again but Tagovailoa escaped pressure on third down and found Prather who made a spectacular catch over Ore Adeyi to pick up 24 yards and move Maryland to midfield. Three straight Roman Hemby touches picked up 23 yards to set up Maryland on the fringes of the red zone and a great receiver screen to Jeshaun Jones gave the Terrapins a first and goal. Tagovalioa got the offense to the doorstep on a scramble but on third down he couldn’t find the end zone on a tush push-style play. Maryland’s offense stayed on the field but Tagovailoa’s pass for Rico Walker was tipped by Xander Mueller and fell harmlessly to the turf. Northwestern once again had to start a drive inside its own 5-yard line and this time the ball was mere inches from the goal line. Sullivan was pushed forward for two yards on the opening play but a false start sent the Wildcats backward. The ‘Cats were able to get a first down on the next play though thanks to Cam Johnson slipping tackles on a short pass and pushing forward for 12 yards. Sullivan scrambled for another first down and after two consecutive screens to Henning ran for another first down that moved the Wildcats to the 45-yard line with just over two minutes left in the half. On the next set of downs the ‘Cats’ QB dropped an absolute dime to Johnson who found the sweet spot in the defense and the connection resulted in a gain of 34.  After a pair of Anthony Tyus runs and a Sullivan incompletion Jack Olsen came on and nailed a 34-yard field goal and Northwestern expanded its lead 24-14 with just over a minute left in the first half.  Maryland was able to quickly dissect the defense on the ensuing drive. After a screen was broken up on the opening play Tagovailoa completed three consecutive passes for a total of 60 yards to set Maryland up at the Northwestern 16. After that he threw two straight incompletions setting up a third down with 18 seconds to play. The result of the play was another incompletion and Maryland was forced to settle for three as well. Jack Howes’ attempt from 34 yards away was true but Northwestern went into halftime with a 24-17 lead. In the second half Northwestern picked up where it left off. Coco Azema broke a kickoff return for 61 yards setting up Northwestern in prime territory. Short gains set up a 47-yard field goal attempt for Olsen which he buried with ease to push the lead back to 10.  Maryland quickly responded with Colby McDonald erupting for a gain of 19 on the opening play to reach Northwestern territory; however the drive stalled out and Maryland had to punt for the second time in the game. Northwestern would punt the ball right back after a physically taxing series for Sullivan and Maryland started its next drive in plus territory. On third down Tagovailoa kept the ball himself for a gain of 10 to move the chains and Azema had to leave the field to enter the medical tent. Without Azema the secondary was vulnerable and a Tagovailoa pass to the end zone was dropped by an open Jones.  Three straight runs set up a third down and after a completion short of the sticks Xander Mueller was flagged for a late hit to set Maryland up at the six. He would make up for it by stonewalling Tagovailoa on the ensuing third down and Maryland once again was forced to settle for a field goal which Howes converted to cut the lead to 27-20.  On the ensuing drive Sullivan was sacked on second down and picked up just five yards on third down forcing a second consecutive Wildcat punt. After 236 yards in the first half Northwestern had totaled just three yards on its first three drives of the second half.  Maryland continued to find occasional success moving the ball. Screen passes to Jones and Octavian Smith Jr. picked up first downs and a run by McDonald got the Terrapins to midfield as the third quarter ended. After that though it was all backward for Maryland as a failed screen pass and a massive sack by Reggie Person set up a fourth-and-22.  Northwestern’s next drive started at its own 32 after an interference penalty on the punt. Joseph Himon II took his first catch of the game for 14 yards and two plays later Sullivan scrambled for 18 yards to put the Wildcats back in Maryland territory. A holding penalty seemingly stymied the drive but Sullivan found Henning for a gain of 34 on a busted play to set up first and goal. Henning laid out to secure the ball in one of the most athletic plays of the game but his efforts didn’t result in a touchdown after the next three plays gained just two yards. Olsen’s kick was once again true and Northwestern extended the lead to 30-20 with under 10 minutes remaining in the game.  On the second play of the next drive Tagovailoa found Jones inside the Northwestern 40 but illegally: Jones had committed offensive pass interference which set up a third-and-23. With the Terrapins in desperation mode Tagovailoa went deep for Prather but couldn’t fit the ball through the coverage of Ore Adeyi and overthrew both. Maryland had to punt yet again its third punt in four second-half drives. Northwestern would make them regret it. Sullivan found Himon on a beautifully set up screen pass and Simon shook half the Maryland defense before finally being run out of bounds inside the 10 after a 53-yard pickup. After two fruitless runs Sullivan seemingly found Henning in the end zone for the clinching touchdown but the officials ruled the pass was incomplete. The call was correct as the ball did hit the turf despite protests and boos from the Northwestern faithful. Olsen continued his perfect day converting his fourth field goal from 29 yards out to push the lead to 33-20.  Maryland wouldn’t go away without a fight. After starting on their own 39 after a squib kick the Terps quickly marched down the field behind Tagovailoa and his receivers. He completed four passes for a total of 47 yards including an 18-yard strike to Jones to slice the deficit in half. The Northwestern lead was cut to 33-27 and because the Maryland drive took just 80 seconds off the clock there were still almost four minutes to play.  Two runs for Northwestern resulted in two Maryland timeouts and the ensuing third down would be snapped with 3:32 left on the game clock. Sullivan got outside the pocket but couldn’t escape defensive lineman Tre Colbert who sacked him for a loss. While Maryland was forced to use its final timeout Tagovailoa and company got the ball back with 3:16 to play and just 59 yards between them and the end zone. That journey would get slightly longer after Tagovailoa was sacked on first down the sixth time Northwestern’s pass rush got to him. A 12 yard completion set up third and three and Roman Hemby plunged forward for five yards to move into Northwestern territory. Two more Tagovailoa passes moved the ball to the 31 but his next pass was blown up for no gain with under two minutes left. Tagovailoa moved quickly but a wide-open Felton couldn’t hold on to the ball resulting in another third down. Once again Tagovailoa failed to convert this time to devastating effect. His overthrow was intercepted by Coco Azema (who went to the locker room due to injury concerns earlier in the half) and the turnover with less than 90 seconds to go sealed Maryland’s fate.  A lengthy review affirmed the call much to the delight of the sideline and black-clad fans in the stands. Two kneeldowns later Northwestern had clinched its second conference victory of the year and moved back to .500 on the year. The Wildcats will look to reach a winning record next Saturday when they take on Iowa at Wrigley Field.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Looking to bounce back Northwestern returns to Evanston to take on the Maryland Terrapins in a Halloweekend clash. As our staff prepares for the weekend’s festivities here is what we think will happen today at Ryan Field. Iggy Dowling: Maryland 27 Northwestern 13 Chances are that Ben Bryant doesn’t play in this one. Northwestern’s defense played really well in Lincoln but it’s going to be much more difficult to hold this Maryland offense down. Even if it does NU’s offensive line hasn’t shown that it can provide the consistent protection necessary to keep pace with the Terps. Bradley Locker: Maryland 30 Northwestern 13 Since the beginning of the season this game has just been a bad matchup for the Wildcats. Even with the departures to numerous Terps stars like Deonte Banks (shoutout Iggy’s Giants) Jakorian Bennett and Rakim Jarrett UMD still has star power with Taulia Tagovailoa and Roman Hemby. Maryland’s trio of Jeshaun Jones Kaden Prather and Tai Felton should pose considerable problems for NU’s secondary; meanwhile EDGEs Donnell Brown and Quashon Fuller could very well wreck this game. Assuming Brendan Sullivan gets the nod yet again I don’t expect much of a different outcome than the junior’s first start last year in College Park which ended in defeat. David Gold: Maryland 27 Northwestern 10 To be blunt Northwestern’s offense simply cannot hang with the Terps. I have very little faith in Brendan Sullivan and the offensive line to get things going especially against a ferocious Maryland front four. With a team that has already forced nine interceptions I expect Sullivan to give the ball away at least once. On the other side Taulia Tagovailoa is the second-best quarterback the ‘Cats will face all season and Roman Hemby is poised for another big day against a banged-up NU front seven. All in all this game will probably leave Northwestern with some Halloween ghouls. Ethan Segall: Maryland 28 Northwestern 7 This Maryland team is going to come out hungry and rested coming into this game off a bye week and on a two-game skid. With a win in Evanston the Terps accomplish bowl eligibility and can rebound from an ugly loss to a mediocre Illinois team. Roman Hemby is going to have a massive day against Northwestern’s front seven and I think Maryland takes care of the ‘Cats in unexciting fashion. Natalie Wells: Maryland 34 Northwestern 10 Looking at the quarterback position this just isn’t a fair matchup. Taulia Tagovailoa has been slinging it for the Terrapins as he sits at 1926 passing yards on the season (second in the B1G). Meanwhile Brendan Sullivan will likely make his third consecutive start after a rough showing against Nebraska. I’m expecting Maryland’s receivers to run circles around NU’s defensive backs — this could get ugly folks. Ascher Levin: Maryland 24 Northwestern 14 Following a tough loss against Nebraska Northwestern is taking on Maryland. The Terrapins have a potent passing attack with Taulia Tagovailoa leading the way. Tagovailoa has distributed the ball nicely and his top three wide receivers each have at least 350 receiving yards. The Wildcats will have to limit Maryland through the air if they want to be successful defensively. Northwestern had a great game defensively last week but a horrible offensive game. It is looking like Brendan Sullivan will be the quarterback again for this game and he has to improve his pocket presence. The offensive line isn’t giving him much time but Sullivan can’t look to escape the pocket right away. Even if Sullivan improves Maryland will be too much for the Wildcats to contain. Brendan Preisman: Maryland 28 Northwestern 14 The Wildcats couldn’t buy a touchdown against Nebraska putting up just nine points despite multiple first half drives starting in Nebraska territory. The defense for the third consecutive game also showed too many cracks in the second half for Northwestern to be confident they can shut down the Terrapins. Taulia Tagovailoa is probably the best quarterback the Northwestern defense has faced since Riley Leonard and even on a brisk October day he should provide enough firepower for Maryland to win easily.

Share this story Complementary football.  If you have listened to David Braun speak for a second this season you have heard him utter those words. Whenever a question is asked about what Northwestern needs to do to get back on track or what it is doing well there is a strong likelihood that his answer will have those two words in it. In fact he says it so much that the saying made its way into my Halloween costume. As much as Braun loves to say those words the Wildcats have not actually played four quarters of complementary football. Sure there were spurts or even halves of good football but NU had yet to play a full 60 minutes of solid football. However on Saturday the ‘Cats finally put it all together and outplayed Maryland for all four quarters. When asked if the team played complementary football Coach Braun answered with one word: “Absolutely.” “Turn on the film and you’ll see it” Braun said after the game. Northwestern displayed what complementary football looked like out of the gate. After a bad first drive on both sides of the ball Taulia Tagovailoa lost grip of the football and the ball landed in Bryce Gallagher’s arms to set NU up in the red zone. Unlike last weekend when Northwestern couldn’t score a touchdown after forcing two turnovers in Nebraska territory the ‘Cats’ offense converted on their opportunity. Cam Porter punched the ball from a yard out to tie the game at seven and the offense got rolling from there. I never thought I would write this sentence but NU scored on four straight possessions on Saturday putting up 24 first-half points. The last time the Wildcats scored that many points to open a game was against the Terps in 2020. After a week where the defense carried the team the offense had to carry the ‘Cats in the first half.  Let me be the first to say it Brendan Sullivan proved me wrong yesterday. I have been very critical of the ‘Cats’ quarterback since he took over for Ben Bryant three games ago even calling for his benching at points but he absolutely balled against the Terps. He threw the ball with precision and made plays off-script with his legs. ""Let’s be frank: the reason Northwestern was not playing complementary football in past weeks was the offense. However even with some offensive line issues the juniors improvisation and playmaking were the reason the ‘Cats’ offense was humming on Saturday. David Braun never waivered in his belief in Sullivan even as the outside noise was loud and the gunslinger proved his head coach right."" “It started to click today” Sullivan said post game.  As the offense put on a show Maryland’s potent offense gave Northwestern’s defense trouble in the first half moving up and down the field. However when it was put up or shut up time the ‘Cats hunkered down. There were multiple times when the defense bent but did not break. Maryland reached the red zone five times but only came away with seven twice.  You want to talk about a game-changing moment and a sign of the defense David Braun is building Maryland had a second-and-goal from the 1-yard line and came away empty-handed. NU stuffed the Terrapins on three straight plays and handed the ball back to the offense which went down the field to kick a field goal. That is all three units doing their jobs together or as Coach Braun would call it complementary football. Northwestern’s game of complementary football carried into the second half but the roles had reversed. The offense stalled out to begin the half going backward on its first three possessions. While the offense stuttered the defense held down the fort. In the final two quarters the defense forced three punts and an interception to seal the game. Against a high-powered offense the defense stifled the Terps and delivered NU the victory. Each side of the ball stepped up when the other struggled carrying the load for stretches of the game and did enough combined to pull off the upset. That is the definition of complementary football. “We put three phases together this week” Coco Azema said. “We’re able to rely on one another and trust one another is huge for the team.” If you know anything about me you knew there was going to be a special teams section. Special teams can make or break a game and the group was advantageous for the Wildcats. In recent years Northwestern has struggled to find a consistent kicker but Jack Olsen has been knockdown for the ‘Cats. Olsen was 4-for-4 yesterday including a 47-yard bomb.  It is a luxury for an offense to trust that if it gets down the field there is a strong probability that it will come away with points. In the return game Coco Azema ripped off a 61-yard kick return to open the second half setting NU up in instant field goal range. Complementary football requires all three phases to play well and for the first time this season all three units were in sync for 60 minutes. One game is not enough to make declarative statements but it is hard to argue that David Braun hasn’t brought the best out of this team. Using complementary football as a slogan is one thing but Braun has the Wildcats playing together and imposing their will on opponents. “Watch out” A.J. Henning exclaimed after the game. “This team has everything we want right in front of us.” \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story The last time Northwestern cross country was in Madison Wisconsin in early September it found itself in a dogfight. Its third-place finish at the Badger Classic a meet in which six of the seven teams in the field came from the Big Ten hinted that the Big Ten Championships a few weeks later would be tight.  Spoiler alert: it was. Although NU initially put itself in great position to put up a program-best team finish and create a very compelling case for a NCAA Championship at-large bid at the conference meet last Friday it fell just outside the top five with 156 points. Ohio State which received votes in the last U.S. Track and Field & Cross Country Coaches Association’s last national poll edged out the ‘Cats by just two points.  On a much brighter note though senior Katherine Hessler ran one of the best races in program history. She snagged a fifth-place finish and an All-Big Ten First Team honor with a 21:10 in the 6K race. Heading into the race No. 15 Michigan State and No. 22 Wisconsin were the clear team favorites as the only nationally-ranked teams in the conference. The real competition was for the next three spots. Michigan Ohio State Northwestern and Penn State are all teams with hopes of punching their ticket to NCAAs in November. However since all of those teams are unlikely to place top-two in their respective regional meets in a few weeks they were all under pressure to put on quality performances in a competitive field to strengthen their resumes. Northwestern was already at a disadvantage here. Missing Anna Hightower a junior who was a key scorer in NU’s NCAA-qualifying lineup in 2022 the Wildcats haven’t flashed as much top-end talent as they did last year. Because of that they entered Big Tens as an underdog compared to the Wolverines Buckeyes and Nittany Lions. The ‘Cats addressed that concern head-on from the gun as three runners placed themselves smack in the middle of the lead pack. Hessler and Kalea Bartolotto tucked in behind Ohio State’s Addie Engel and some other runners while Ava Earl gradually moved her way up into the front over the first mile-and-a-half. Hessler and Bartolotto came through 2K in second and fourth respectively while Earl was in 22nd and moving into the front. Behind them Anna Delgado and Fiona Lenth were in 38th and 45th. NU came through the 1.25-mile marker in third place. It was a pretty fast start for the ‘Cats who even led the fourth-place Badgers by five points. Given that the race took place on Wisconsin’s home course and that the Badgers almost had all seven of their runners in a pack it was inevitable that they’d catch Northwestern. However NU’s early lead over Michigan and Ohio State gave it a legitimate chance to defeat those squads.  The dynamics changed a bit over the middle 2K of the race which featured some easier rolling hills. At about 3K Engel and the MSU duo of Katie Osika and Makenna Veen stretched out the 15-runner lead pack. A little over a half-mile later almost everyone had fallen off that trio with Hessler clinging to the back of the first chase pack trailing the leaders. However Earl made a huge move firmly placing herself in the top 10 for a few minutes. She and Hessler came through 4K together in 10th and eighth while Bartolotto was 12 seconds behind them in 17th. The Wildcats appeared to be faring well individually but fell to fifth as a team at 4K because of what was happening in the middle. Michigan’s third-through-sixth runners moved up a combined 51 spots allowing the Wolverines to jump up to fourth. NU’s back-end scorers had lost a ton of ground on MSU PSU Michigan and Wisconsin in a race that was already very stretched out in the middle which put it in a tough position. Northwestern wasn’t going to get those points at the top because its fastest runners had already gone out quickly and weren’t in a position to challenge Engel and Osika for the individual crown. What Northwestern did have was an advantage over Ohio State’s No. 4 and No. 5 runners. Despite having Engel and Daniella Santos at the top the Buckeyes had struggled mightily with their depth throughout the season. Even though NU had lost to OSU at the Loyola Lakefront Invitational in late September it displayed better depth. With the ‘Cats having put three runners in the top 20 through 4K — challenging Ohio State’s top-end scoring — it seemed like they had a great chance to wrap up fifth place. NU’s top two scorers did close well. Hessler and Bartolotto held their ground with the former kicking the last 2K in 7:02 to take fifth in 21:10. Thirty seconds later Bartolotto earned 16th.  Unfortunately Earl appeared to hit a physical wall and fell back significantly. Right as she was settling into her move at 4K the race hit a massive hill. The leaders took full advantage of the ensuing steep downhill and Earl eventually ran out of gas. She approached the finish line exhausted and valiantly fought through what looked like significant muscle fatigue to crawl through the finish in 74th. Earl was the sixth scorer on the team with Lenth (22:15 41st) Adele Magaud  (22:16 42nd) and Delgado (22:44 62nd) finishing in front of her. Lenth and Magaud each moved up eight spots but couldn’t make up the point difference in front of them. The Buckeyes came back to eke out fifth place by just two points with Gia Napoleon picking off 14 runners in the last 2K to lead the way. It’s not like this was a horrific race from Northwestern by any means. It was just two points away from tying its highest Big Ten finish in program history. However given it was well within striking distance of Ohio State and Penn State which only beat NU by 20 points and spent most of the last 4K losing ground it’s a missed opportunity. Even without Hightower Northwestern could have taken fourth in this race if all the pieces had come together. With her there’s a decent chance NU would be ranked right now. On the bright side it marked the culmination of a phenomenal season for Hessler who broke out as one of the conference’s best runners this year after performing well as a middle scorer on last year’s team.

Olsen @InvrrtedFB  Oct 29, 2023, 12:51pm CDT      / new",Men’s soccer: ‘Cats on the verge of Big Ten title despite mixed results, Northwestern hasn’t finished on top of the conference standings since 2012. Share this story Yes that headline is correct. Northwestern who most in preseason expected to be one of the conference bottom-feeders is 90 minutes away from securing at least a share of the Big Ten regular season title. Currently the Wildcats sit joint-first with Penn State and Michigan State — all on 13 points. However the Spartans have played all eight conference games while NU and PSU still have one match left. Indiana 11 points and Rutgers 10 points — who play each other Sunday —both have an outside shot at finishing top but will need quite a bit of help (as well as a win). Fortunately the math is quite simple for Payne and co. To win the title outright and claim the No. 1 seed in the Big Ten tournament they need a better result at Michigan than the Nittany Lions get at Wisconsin. Match Penn State’s result and they’ll get a share but PSU’s 2-1 win against the ‘Cats would hand it the top seed in the tournament. There are some caveats to this especially pertaining to seeding with three-way ties which truth be told I have no idea how those get broken but a win in Ann Arbor for NU makes them all for naught. From a Wildcat perspective it is obviously nice to be concerned with the calculus at this end of the standings. After the past two years required wins on the final day of the season to just not finish last and qualify for the Big Ten tournament the stakes are still high but for much different reasons. That in itself is a testament to how far this program has come in three seasons under Payne and getting a tangible reward for that development would be a perfect way to send the ‘Cats into the postseason.  Friday Oct. 20 (Evanston Ill.) In the toughest test of the season to date for the ‘Cats (if NCAA’s RPI rankings are anything to go off of) everything that could’ve gone wrong went wrong. My completely rational theory is NU picked up some bad karma after honoring the seniors at a time other than right before the final home match of the year. All jokes aside Michigan State was just an extremely strong traditional 4-4-2 team. After the match Payne described the Spartans as “committed” and that to me was an apt label. Every player works for his 10 teammates on the pitch and they stick to their strategy executing it at a high level even though it’s not particularly complex or revolutionary. The ‘Cats’ ability to cope with MSU’s quality certainly wasn’t helped by Justin Weiss being forced off midway through the first half after picking up an apparent hamstring injury. He would give it another go in the second half but after 10 minutes or so it was evident he couldn’t carry on. During that period between Weiss initially getting injured and halftime the Wildcat attack looked the worst it had all year. Compounded with Michigan State tallying two cheap goals in that time — the first resulting from a questionable handball call in the box and the second from a complete defensive snafu — things couldn’t possibly have looked more bleak for Northwestern at the break. However NU hadn’t given the game up yet and a slight tweak in the in-possession structure revitalized what had been a lifeless attack. Instead of the standard 3-2-1-4 with an AM behind two strikers the ‘Cats came out in a 3-2-5 with three strikers — Ugo Achara through the middle with Christopher Thaggard to his right and Paul Son to his left. In post-game interviews throughout the year Payne has emphasized his belief in the importance of being a team that can both play in front of and over the top of the opponent’s back line and a similar explanation followed when asked about this switch. He said his team didn’t threaten in behind anywhere near enough in the first half and the change in shape was to fix that. In practice that front three was able to pin Michigan State’s back line deeper opening up space between the two banks of four in MSU’s 4-4-2 — decompacting the block — to then be exploited through arrivals. The clip below illustrates this idea well with Northwestern’s 3+2 first manipulating the Spartan press to access Son’s last-line abandonment in the left half-space and then the junior attacker looking to stretch the back line.  pic.twitter.com/beOMTNEI2s Son did a phenomenal job with his role within this new structure but so did his right-sided counterpart. Here after Fritz Volmar arrives in the left half-space (positional rotation between him and Son) Thaggard makes a great lateral movement between the lines to receive before a mazy run opens up a crossing opportunity on the left. pic.twitter.com/UruLUJAWaF On the topic of Volmar who was recently listed No 7. in TopDrawerSoccer’s Top 100 Freshmen rankings the below sequence is a magnificent example of the dynamism he adds   to NU’s attack as well as the potency the ‘Cats showed at the start of the second period. A brilliant carry and run coupled with a lovely pass from Jason Gajadhar gets him clean through on goal but he just can’t finish. pic.twitter.com/72MvayVDur After quite a few opportunities for a Wildcat equalizer came and went the Spartans shifted to a 4-5-1 with 20 minutes to go and set their line of engagement lower limiting Northwestern’s ability to access the center of the pitch. As a result NU struggled to create much outside of set pieces and hopeful crosses and couldn’t complete the comeback. Tuesday Oct. 24 (Evanston Ill.) While there were a lot of interesting aspects of Northwestern’s encounter with Michigan State its next match against Indiana was quite the opposite. And honestly the less that is said about this one the better. I usually don’t like relying on the box score stats to tell the story of a game because they do lack a lot of context but the Hoosiers registering 21 shots to NU’s four does a good job boiling this contest down to one figure. However Jackson Weyman only needing to save three of those 21 attempts to keep a clean sheet says a lot as well. Regardless Indiana was in control of the game throughout and a Nigel Prince goal in the 25th minute off a Reese Mayer long throw (that may or may not have been a foul throw) was the textbook definition of “against the run of play.” The Hoosiers’ dominance only grew in the second half and Payne eventually responded to the one-way traffic in the direction of NU’s goal with a shift to a 5-4-1 from the 4-4-2 block it started the game with. Ultimately the concession of territory and the ball combined with some well-timed blocks kept the red tide out of Weyman’s goal and as a result the ‘Cats picked up a crucial three points in their quest for their first Big Ten title since 2012.

Berry will need to play a major part in any trip back to the postseason for Northwestern. Who he is Senior; 6-foot-3; from Newton Kansas; returning starter 2022-23 stats 34 games (34 starts) 28.3 minutes per game 8.5 points per game 4.8 rebounds per game 1.1 assists per game 0.1 blocks per game 1.4 steals per game 34.2% FG 29.1% 3P 81.4% FT 2022-2023 review Berry had his ups and downs last season for the ‘Cats. There was the “Ty Berry game” at Nebraska in which he put up 26 points making six three-pointers. Then there were games like the one against Penn State in the Big Ten Tournament in which he shot 1-for-10 from the field and 1-for-8 from beyond the arc. Overall Berry scored 8.5 points per game to go along with 4.8 rebounds and 1.1 assists in an inconsistent offensive year. Consistently though Berry was a strong wing defender with the athleticism to match up with talented Big Ten guards. For a junior in his first year as a clear-cut starter Berry impressed in that way enough to keep his spot in the rotation. He was also a really solid free throw shooter converting from the line at a 81.4% clip (up from 66.7% the year before). At the end of the day however because of his offensive inconsistency Berry was overshadowed and outshined by Boo Buie and Chase Audige all year. He was arguably the third best scoring option but Brooks Barnhizer and Robbie Beran both had some claim to that title as well. Strengths Shooting…. kinda? Berry’s 34.2% field goal percentage from last year doesn’t look great but it was also the worst of his college career. There’s reason to believe he is at least capable of making shots at a more consistent rate. Berry also possesses the ability to create his own shot something not a ton of Northwestern’s players can claim. If he can start to cash in a little bit more often he could become a problem for opposing teams. It’s also worth noting once again that Berry is becoming a very good free throw shooter as he matures. There are a variety of ways he is capable of scoring the basketball. Berry is also a good defender with quick feet and active hands who knows the defensive system and is accustomed to executing it in big spots. His familiarity with the ‘Cats’ program heading into his fourth season shouldn’t be understated especially for a team that needs its defensive system to sustain success without its Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year. His 4.8 rebounds per game last year is also worth mentioning; Berry makes an impact on the boards. Weaknesses   The output just hasn’t been there yet. His numbers are underwhelming and while numbers don’t tell the whole story don’t overthink Berry’s. The guard sometimes simply cannot avoid long stretches of inefficient shooting. Berry’s approach to continuing to test from deep after misses also isn’t entirely effective. The incoming junior can be a frustrating watch when he’s taking early shot clock threes from NBA distance. As one of Northwestern’s expected primary scorers he’ll have to continue to work in that department. Berry’s performances against Penn State in the Big Ten Tourney and then against UCLA in the NCAA Tournament did not help bolster the Wildcats’ chances. Stepping into an even larger leadership role this year as a senior — and without Audige — he’ll be tasked with showing up in big games. Expectations I’m certainly not bullish on Berry heading into the year but there’s reason to believe he could iron some things out to become a more complete player. The good news is even if he doesn’t he’s still a skilled guard who makes an impact defensively. I do expect Berry’s numbers to improve. I don’t think he’ll take as many bad shots and his presumptive role as the starting two guard will help. I am however concerned about his ability to step up in big games. To what extent Berry can become a more consistent scorer should determine how well he helps mask the loss of Audige. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Two others in the Big Ten East continued their winning ways even if it came with more of a struggle than either team anticipated. We even had one team provide us with a massive Big Ten West vs. Big Ten East upset. Welcome to another edition of Around the Big Ten! Four-way tie atop the Big Ten West A couple weeks ago I declared that five Big Ten teams had chances of winning a division title. It appears the statement was premature given the current mess atop the Big Ten West. After division leader Wisconsin predictably fell to Ohio State 24-10 this past weekend albeit in a much more competitive game than expected there are now four teams in the division with a 3-2 record in conference play. Wisconsin is one. Iowa who was idle this weekend is another. Minnesota and Nebraska(!) join them in a tie for first place. Both teams capitalized on the Badgers loss with wins this weekend. Minnesota beat conference cellar-dweller Michigan State 27-12 while the Cornhuskers crushed Purdue 31-14 at home in the team’s homecoming game. With four games remaining for each team including pivotal matchups between each other it’s still anyone’s race. According to ESPN’s Matchup Predictor it’s Iowa’s race to lose. It predicts Iowa to run the table and finish 7-2 in conference play. The model predicts Wisconsin will do the same resulting in a tiebreaker that would favor the Hawkeyes after Iowa beat the Badgers a few weeks ago. The predictor has Minnesota finishing 2-2 and Nebraska 1-3. In spite of the model it’s Minnesota who controls its own destiny as they already have wins over Iowa and Nebraska. Unfortunately for the Golden Gophers they still have to play Ohio State. Nebraska still has to play Iowa and Wisconsin which presents an opportunity but also a tough path. This is why I believe Wisconsin is going to be the team to emerge and take the division crown after seeing how the team played against the Buckeyes and taking into account the fact that Iowa has to play Nebraska on the road. But unlike how it seemed even just last week this is a fight that’s far from over. The Power of 33 The 33 points scored by the likes of Northwestern and Penn State this weekend come with different sets of emotion. For the Wildcats fans have to be elated after the team upset Maryland 33-27 this weekend despite coming in as two-touchdown underdogs at home. The win came at the hands of current starting quarterback Brendan Sullivan. Sullivan was 16-of-23 for 265 yards and two passing touchdowns and added 56 yards rushing. After jumping out to a 24-17 lead at halftime Sullivan and the Wildcats managed to hold on late as senior defensive back Coco Azema intercepted a pass by Maryland quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa and sealed the win for Northwestern with Maryland threatening inside the red zone. A win is a win is a win. But a nine-point win over Indiana is likely not what Penn State had in mind especially coming off a frustrating loss to Ohio State. The Nittany Lions escaped with a 33-24 win Saturday after scoring nine points in the last two minutes. The 9-0 run came after Indiana had tied the game at 24 on a 35-yard field goal by sophomore kicker Chris Freeman with 2:58 remaining in the fourth quarter. Penn State quarterback Drew Allar while producing a stat line that looked pretty on the surface struggled once again this weekend this time in a game that the team was favored heavily in at home. He threw a crucial interception his first of the season deep in Penn State territory to set up Indiana’s game-tying field goal. Luckily for the Nittany Lions they won and remain in the Big Ten East race and they get to take on a struggling Maryland team next weekend as they look to get back on track. Zero is not the hero Zero is the number of Big Ten wins Indiana and Michigan State have combined after each lost once again this past weekend. Indiana as mentioned above showed life against Penn State but ultimately lost 33-24. Michigan State meanwhile looked lifeless once more in the 27-12 loss to Minnesota. Zero is also the number of wins the pair of schools have against FBS opponents this season. The wins between the two? Akron Central Michigan Indiana State and Richmond. Two MAC schools and a pair of FCS teams. Speaking of the Indiana win over Akron that win occurred September 24. The Hoosiers and Spartans have zero wins amongst the two of them since. Michigan State hasn’t won since September 9. There is good news for the pair however. These teams have to play one another before the season ends. That game will take place November 18 in Bloomington and it ensures that at least one of these teams will remove their set of zeroes from the board by season end. As for the loser of that game…   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Well that was fun! Coming in as 14-point underdogs Northwestern played four quarters of fashionable football to beat Big Ten foe Maryland 33-27. It is the Wildcats’ most impressive win of the season and puts them back at the .500 mark heading into their matchup against Iowa at Wrigley Field. Here are five things we learned from Northwestern’s exhilarating victory over the Terrapins.  Brendan Sullivan can be a winning quarterback After Sullivan’s struggles against Nebraska last week many Northwestern fans amplified their hopes for Ben Bryant to return back to the starting role. In Lincoln Sullivan completed just 52% of his passes and failed to lead his squad to the end zone. The Northwestern offense was stagnant against the Cornhuskers and with Bryant still injured (upper body) expectations were for more of the same. Instead Sullivan shocked the world looking like a completely different quarterback than he did just one week prior. He was cool calm and most importantly he was confident. This was evident almost immediately — Sully completed all of his first six throws and after the ‘Cats punted on their first drive they went on to score on all of the rest of their first half possessions. After just one half Northwestern had already tripled its scoring total from the week prior.  There was a certain fluidity to Sullivan’s game on Saturday — something Northwestern hasn’t seen much of this year from the quarterback position. He clearly had developed a strong connection to the offense and was comfortable enough to trust his athletic instincts. Whether flipping it out to an open Cam Porter under pressure for a touchdown or scrambling out of the pocket to pick up a first down Sullivan looked fearless. He finished Saturday’s game with career-highs in passing yards (265) rushing yards (56) and passer rating (195.0) but most impressive was the tenacity he displayed throughout.  It is still unclear who will line up under center for Northwestern next week at the Friendly Confines. After Sullivan’s performance against Maryland it is safe to say that David Braun can have confidence in either Sullivan or Bryant to get the job done. While both have had some moments to forget they have both shown flashes of incredible play this season. They have both shown that they can be winning quarterbacks.  This front seven can compete Things were looking quite glum for Northwestern right off the bat. The Terps drove down the field in a hurry and got on the board with a touchdown less than three minutes into the game. The ‘Cats punted it back quickly thereafter and in the early going the game had signs of a Maryland blowout. The catalyst for changing course was the defense — specifically the men up front. On a Taulia Tagovailoa pass deep in Maryland territory a pressure-induced fumble gave the Wildcats the field position to score their first TD of the game. It also generated key momentum for the ‘Cats — propelling them forward the rest of the way. Until their matchup against Maryland the front seven has been a sore spot for Northwestern. In the seven games prior to Saturday they had averaged just 1.2 sacks per game putting them among the bottom 20 FBS teams in that statistic. On Saturday they exploded for six sacks — three of them coming from lineman Aidan Hubbard. They were playing with a newfound fire and a physicality that they haven’t shown all too often this year. The ‘Cats defensive front will look to continue this trend next week against Iowa a team notorious for their gritty style of play.  The ‘Cats have some serious playmakers Until Saturday it felt as if Northwestern would get one notable performance from one of their playmakers each game. In the home opener against UTEP it was Cam Porter with 90 rushing yards. Against Minnesota Bryce Kirtz starred going for over 200 yards. On Saturday against Maryland it was a different story — everyone had the chance to shine. Kirtz and Porter led the way again racking up all three of Northwestern’s touchdowns but so many others contributed in big ways. A.J. Henning had his best game as a Wildcat with five receptions and over 50 receiving yards. Joseph Himon II scurried across the field for 53 yards to set up Northwestern in the red zone. Coco Azema delivered in two facets: he had a huge yard kick return and provided the game-sealing interception late in the fourth quarter.  With skilled players all over the field the ‘Cats kept pressure on the Maryland defense all game. They were firing on all cylinders repeatedly finding ways to open up the field for their athletes. The ‘Cats were in a rhythm and it was fun to watch.  Late game execution may need some work In a game with so many positives Northwestern very nearly let it all slip away at the end. Up 10 points in the last minutes of the game NU failed to score a touchdown inside the ten and instead of taking a three-possession lead they settled for a field goal and went up only 13 points — a deficit erasable with two touchdowns. Sure enough the Terrapins strolled down the field for one touchdown and nearly made it two had it not been for Azema’s heroic interception.  The Wildcats have only played one other close game while holding a lead — against Howard. In that game too the Wildcats had many chances to put it away to put it out of reach. They didn’t and barely escaped with a three point win. The story was similar against Maryland. Northwestern had an opportunity to close the door much earlier on the Terps but they instead narrowly missed blowing a sizable lead. They got away with it against Howard and Maryland but if they want to build off of the momentum of their Maryland win the ‘Cats will want to improve on their execution during crunch time. David Braun can lead this team to a bowl game Heading into Week 10 here we are discussing the possibility of Northwestern bowl eligibility. Coming off of a one-win season an offseason of controversy and a massive head coaching change it is truly remarkable that the ‘Cats find themselves in this position. While we obviously must give credit to the players who made it happen it is undeniable that David Braun deserves an abundance of praise. In his first-ever head coaching gig he has seemingly garnered the respect of his team and has instilled the value of “complementary football” into their veins. By the looks of it Braun is having a blast and it seems as if the players mirror that energy.  Before they pulled off the improbable upset of Maryland it was much tougher to see a path for bowl eligibility. After all they were fresh off a near-loss to an FCS school and a frustrating defeat to Nebraska on the road. Now the record is a respectable .500 and most importantly the ‘Cats have momentum. Coming off an impressive win with four winnable games on the horizon bowl eligibility feels more possible than ever for the Wildcats. And who knows — the Big Ten West is still up for grabs and Northwestern is nowhere near being out of the race. Why not make a run for that Big Ten West Title? At least while they still can. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story With just four games left in its 2023 season Northwestern football sits at 4-4 — a remarkable feat that almost nobody saw coming unless you’re interim head coach David Braun. With the Wildcats set to battle the Iowa Hawkeyes (who they haven’t beaten since 2020) from Wrigley Field this weekend hear what NU’s guide had to say during his weekly media availability. Opening Statement: “Exciting time to be around the facility right now. A team that battled on Saturday; found a way to get a big win against a really good Maryland team. We were back at it this morning evaluating the film. I think the thing that’s exciting for this group and this coaching staff moving forward is we feel like we’re getting better as a team — we’re improving — but I think it’s also very clear to everyone in the building that there’s still a lot of room for improvement moving forward. I’ve said this before; I’ll continue to say it: I think our best football is still in front of us. “This afternoon the group will be back. There will be an opportunity for us to completely shift our focus to a very good Iowa team. We know the challenge that is ahead against a team that in a lot of ways embodies a lot of the things that we pride ourselves on here at Northwestern — in terms of being a developmental program that plays with great fundamental great technique and great physicality. Iowa certainly embodies that. “Opportunity to be playing at Wrigley Field in a rivalry game is something that this group is really excited about.” On Ben Bryant’s status: “Do not anticipate Ben playing this week. Said it last week: he’s  progressing maybe not as quickly as he’d like to or as we’d like him to. He is working his butt off. Anticipate getting him back at some point. Anticipate that Brendan Sullivan will be going for us this week.” On playing at Wrigley: “I know I’ve had a lot of these moments in the last year but it’s just another pinch-yourself moment. First professional baseball game I ever went to was with my dad at Wrigley Field. Drove down grabbed a hot dog on the way. Mark Grace Sean Duston Joe Girardi — all those guys are still playing — Ryne Sandberg. Remember walking up the stadium parking in the back alley all those things. An opportunity to be part of a football game at Wrigley Field? What a unique special experience to say that I’m getting an opportunity to get to coach in that game. Pretty special. Really excited for our fanbase to experience it our players to experience this. Really excited for my two boys to get an opportunity to experience this. It’s going to be a special day.” On the historically low over/under: “I know it sounds super cliche: I wasn’t aware of that. We don’t pay attention to that. I think this group has all the extra motivation that it needs. We’re going to keep focusing on the people in this building.” On the crucial goal-line stand against Maryland: “What that D-line room has been able to do this season is such a reflection of what you hope is happening all over this team right now. It’s banked reps from us double-repping during fall camp. It’s investment paying off in terms of some of our developmental indy. It’s developmental paying off in some of the bye week. It’s the walk-on program here at Northwestern. You look at some of those guys — the four guys lined up with their hands in the dirt against Maryland at one point it’s two true freshmen and a former walk-on. You’re going ‘I’ll take this group any day.’ They’ve battled; they’ve invested; they’ve continued to improve. Really proud of that group. We need to continue to push especially with this week. Our D-line will be tested this week in a big big way. “In terms of those situations you’ve got to be really careful how you practice those high-intensity scenarios. It’s really hard to replicate. To be honest with you the only time you really practice those scenarios live is maybe an isolated practice or two during fall camp; when you get into scout team sessions you’re practicing those scenarios at about 80% just to make sure that you keep people on their feet and keep people healthy. On preparing for the last play from that sequence: “It’s really difficult. You’re picking your poison. Honestly anticipated on the fourth down that it would be a pass. You start to ask yourself ‘Are we willing to call a defense that plays to the pass and then all of a sudden they hand the ball off and they walk in for a touchdown?’ You’re going ‘We’re going to make them earn every inch.’ Just a credit to Xander [Mueller] making a huge play in that situation for us and to the rest of our defense for getting ourselves to that point. These are questions that I ask myself every week. In the moment I’m asking myself that same question: ‘What are you willing to give up here?’ At that point we were going to force them to execute on a pass play and give everything we had to stopping the run.” On changes to gameday operations playing at Wrigley: “We’ll have to be very strategic in that. You’ll see the same format [as 2021] with both teams on the same sideline. That’ll create some unique substitution situations. The Big Ten and the officiating crew has done a great job of communicating with us in terms of what that’s going to look like and how we need to operate. I firmly am confident that our guys will handle it well. We’ve got to find ways to replicate that in practice to the best of our ability. Just another piece to the puzzle in terms of a very unique and special opportunity for our guys.” On Aidan Hubbard winning Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week: “Really proud of Aidan. Some things that we’re starting to see are the things we’ve seen out of Aidan in practice on a consistent basis. Had a great fall camp. Has really developed as a pass rusher. Starting to mature in terms of his preparation and the urgency that he plays with. I think last year when you turned on the film — or even in spring ball — Aidan was doing what he was supposed to but didn’t have that urgency didn’t have that motor didn’t have that edge that you’re looking for out of a big time Big Ten defensive lineman. I think you’re starting to see that maturing process from a young man that we’re not only expecting to perform but also help lead that room. For him to have production like that on Saturday is really exciting but not surprising. He’s put in a lot of work.” On conversations with Brendan Sullivan after the Nebraska loss: “The first thing that I told him was that I was proud of him and that he’s a stinking warrior — the way he battled out in Nebraska. Did he play a perfect game? Absolutely not. He battled; battled for his team. Was really proud of him. And then you go back and you watch the film; evaluate where he needs to be better. Coach Bajakian expects a lot out of Brendan. Brendan expects a lot out of Brendan. I think we did a really good job this week of getting Sully comfortable. Performed much better around him on offense. With the play-calling I think did some really good things to get the ball out of his hands on time which allowed for him to get into a rhythm and play his best football.” On what Sullivan needs to do to succeed against the Hawkeyes’ defense: “We’ll all be challenged this week in so many different ways. This Iowa defense is a model for consistency. Just the way that Coach Parker and the rest of that staff — it’s impressive. We’re going to have to detail our work this week. I think the things that we’re going to hold Sully accountable to is just his process. Where his eyes are at in his progressions; making good sound decisions; protecting the football. I think all of us at times can get caught up in the statline. You don’t find wins and losses in the statline. If his statline comes back next Saturday at varying numbers and much lower totals in terms of passing yards but we find a way to win that’s good quarterback play. “Against such a talented defense such a well-coached defense in Iowa I think the expectation in terms of his ceiling is just being a great decision-maker a great manager of the game a great leader on the sideline. Getting the ball out on time. Forcing Iowa’s defense to earn everything that they get. With the way that Sully’s trending there’s no doubt in my mind that he’s going to continue to put our team in a lot of good situations to win a lot of football games.” On more playing time for Michael Kilbane and Dylan Roberts: “Part of it was out of necessity in terms of where we’re at from a depth perspective. Dylan played against Minnesota; Michael played some against Howard. They earned that opportunity with their practice habits with the way that they’re performing on scout team and giving the offense good looks. Kilbane last week was the scout team player of the week; all of a sudden turns around a few days later and he’s playing 30 snaps of Big Ten football. “What it comes down to in terms of those guys being ready isn’t just one flash practice where it’s like ‘Oh my gosh! He had a great day.’ It’s just that consistency of ‘Man this guy’s getting better and better and better one day at a time.’ Really comes down to a certain element of trust — that you trust that you can put that young man out there and you are confident that he’s going to be able to execute at a high level for his teammates and the guys around him. Both those guys have proven to be worthy of that opportunity.” On D-line coaching: “Christian [Smith] would be the first one to tell you — Logan McCormick who is our defensive GA who played for us at North Dakota State will tell you. Watch out: if you get me down in D-line drills I might stick around for a while. I get pretty passionate about that that position. I have not micro-managed that position. We hired Christian Smith for a reason; he earned that opportunity through the interview process. I think the greatest gift I can give Christian is my perspective some wisdom and knowledge from coaching the position prior. Also giving him the sense that it’s his position group. “I feel like great D-line play is guys playing free. Not with the mentality of ‘Don’t get reach! Don’t get reach! Don’t make a mistake!’ It’s ‘Man I’m going to play vertical knockback aggressive football. If I make a mistake I’m going to make it fast. I’m going to make it violent.’ That’s great D-line play. Sometimes Christian will come to me with questions concerned about ‘Oh I want to make sure this is just how David wants it.’ “Talking about Taulia and preparing for him we got to find a way to just get to him. Just get him off his spot. I know pass rush lanes are critical but no one’s getting to him. We’ve just got to find a way to get to him and affect him. Playing fast; playing with conviction. I think that is showing up in our play. I can’t speak highly enough of Christian and the job that he’s done with that group.” On the significance of this game: “I think the attitude is number one we’ve got to respond. Last week was a response after a really tough crushing loss. How are we going to respond to success? How are we going to respond to people talking about bowl games and the Big Ten West and our standings? Tune it all out guys. It’s interference. What do we need to do today to position ourselves for a great practice into preparation for a really good football team? That is so much easier said than done. I have a tremendous amount of belief in the maturity and the leadership in this football team with a lot of reminders that this team will be able to do that — because we’re going to have to. This football team is too well-coached too talented; finds ways to win football games. We’re going to have a great week of preparation and that starts this afternoon.” On preparing for Cooper DeJean in the punt return game: “My first conversation was with Matt Entz up at North Dakota State. When I was up at North Dakota State we offered him. I really would’ve appreciated if Matt Entz could’ve closed that recruiting up and gotten Cooper up to North Dakota State so we didn’t have to deal with him now. All kidding aside he’s such a model for what the Iowa program has stood for. They’ve done a tremendous job of recruiting their home state; keeping Iowa kids at home that are passionate about playing for the Hawkeyes. “He is a dynamic talented instinctual football player. That will be an absolutely critical piece of this gameplan working with Coach Genyk throughout the week in terms of just limiting our risk. At the end of the day sometimes you’ve got to compete and trust your guys to make plays. At the same time you only want to give someone like that — a young man like that with that skillset — so many opportunities to touch the football.” On how punting styles may change to favoring bouncing kicks: “I think that is certainly a part of our thought process and considerations. How can we find ways to continue to create field position while also limiting his [DeJean’s] opportunities back there to field the ball cleanly with time to make things happen? We’ve all seen what he can do with the ball in his hands. We’re going to have to find ways to get creative. At times we’re going to have to just trust our guys to go cover and tackle and play with great leverage. He is a dude.” On the importance of growth via practice: “I think we’re in a unique setting. There’s a lot of Big Ten teams that entered into fall camp with 120 guys for Day One of fall camp. We had 103. We’ve talked since Day One: it’s going to take all of us. You don’t know when your opportunity’s coming. It’s really not a matter of if; it’s a matter of when. Owning your role. “What does it look like for Michael Kilbane to own his role? In fall camp it was just continuing to improve each and every day. Early on during the season it was be the best scout team player you can possibly be. As he continues to get better and earn credibility and trust — and opportunity arises with some injury — he walks through that door. You turn on the film: he may not have showed up in the statline but that young man helped us in a big way win a football game on Saturday. “I think Michael’s a great example for all the guys in our program whether you’re a freshman or a junior that doesn’t have the role that you want. Staying the course; continue to improve; owning your role; staying ready. It’s not a matter of if but when that opportunity’s going to come.” On the lack of a winning streak thus far: “I haven’t gone back and evaluated it. I’m proud of the way that we’ve responded after losses for sure. What a great opportunity for us to keep momentum within the season. So much of it is just isolating one game at a time. It’s going to be absolutely critical as we come back this afternoon that man we completely put Maryland behind us. Iowa’s a completely different operation completely different skillset in terms of their strengths. Our guys understand that. We’re going to have to do a great job of focusing on the details. In some ways channeling the emotion around this game in terms of the competitive demeanor that we know is going to be required to compete with a team like Iowa — while bringing that competitive demeanor and edge with a level of poise that allows us to play clean football.” On his plans for Halloween: “None for me. You can count on Kristin Braun to come up with some creative ideas for our kiddos. Lukas and Andrew were the wet bandits from Home Alone last year. Absolutely hilarious. This year we’ve got some Mario Luigi. You can’t forget about little Blake: she’s going to be Princess Peach. Kristin Braun has got that all lined up. Going to be a fun day for the Braun family tomorrow.” On the work of the specialists: “Expecting them to continue to do what they’re doing. What we saw out of Hunter [Renner] at Nebraska was just a model for excellence. Jack [Olsen] continues to play at a really high level. Will [Halkyard]. Those guys are just such pros. What I mean by pros — they’re clearly student-athletes and great students here at Northwestern — but just the way they handle themselves in the facility. They have their routine; they stick to it. They just take ownership of their craft. Expect them to just continue to do what they’ve been doing up until this point. Field position will play a critical role.” On Joseph Himon II: “It’s awesome. It’s not awesome in practice in fall camp when we’re competing against our offense from a defensive coordinator’s perspective in the past. That dude was such a headache last spring ball to me as a defensive coordinator. Gave our defense fits this fall camp. To see him stepping into this role and being utilized in creative and different ways. You can see the way that our guys respond when Joe gets the ball in space. You watch that coach’s copy of that film; A.J. Henning blocking downfield; Bryce Kirtz straining for a block; our O-line getting downfield; Marshall Lang. I mean it’s pretty exciting. You get the ball in the hands of a young man like Joe. Really proud of the way that he’s stepped up. A credit to our staff of putting him in those situations.” On A.J. Henning’s six targets: “I think that’s always something that’s on the forefront of Mike’s mind. I think some of the specific scheme was more tailored toward what we were seeing out of Maryland. That is at the forefront of Coach Binns’ and Coach Bajakian’s mind. We know the playmaker that A.J. is and how critical he is to what we’re doing. “I’ve got to be honest with you: I’ve got to love up the rest of that room. The level of play that we’re seeing out of Cam Johnson and Bryce Kirtz. That room as a whole continues to step up in big big ways. A.J. is certainly a big part of that.” On his candy-eating habits: “I’ll tell you what: I have a sweet tooth. I’ll put it this way: when I get home their candy will probably be hidden.”   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After achieving an upset victory over Maryland Northwestern is once again at .500 and in the thick of the competition to make a bowl game. One step in getting there will be winning this weekend’s showdown against Iowa at Wrigley Field. The ‘Cats are looking to continue their winning ways while the Hawkeyes hope their bye week gave them enough time to recover from their loss to Minnesota two weeks ago. Here are three matchups to watch for in this Big Ten West showdown.  Brendan Sullivan vs Iowa’s defense While Ben Bryant’s status remains up in the air expect David Braun to stick with Brendan Sullivan for the foreseeable future. Sullivan excelled against Maryland registering over 300 yards from scrimmage against a tenacious defensive unit. He also recorded a QBR of 82.5 a colossal improvement from his previous two starts in which he failed to record a figure above 30 in either game. He has seen massive improvement particularly given the circumstances surrounding injuries and other concerns on the offensive side of the ball. Especially following the loss to Nebraska a 33-point showing on offense coupled with Sullivan’s resurgence is encouraging news ahead of another formidable opponent. Unfortunately for Sullivan and the NU offense Iowa’s defense is not just one of the best in the Big Ten but one of the most dominant in the country. Even with a struggling offense the defense has kept the Hawkeyes in games oftentimes giving them just enough ammunition to win close matchups. Iowa kept Wisconsin’s offense to six points in Madison winning a huge Big Ten West game as a result. At home the defense has also held its ground allowing only 14 points to Purdue and 12 to Minnesota despite Iowa losing the latter game by two points. Against the ‘Cats the defense could be a determining factor potentially halting Sullivan’s glorious return to form. Indeed Iowa’s defense could cause Sullivan to make mistakes and revert back to pre-Maryland form. Conversely the arduous matchup could motivate Sullivan and give him and the offense the ability to outplay the defense and continue their offensive progress from last week. Only time will tell how this plays out. Northwestern’s defense vs Iowa’s offense This feels kind of basic doesn’t it? It might seem like an obvious matchup but Iowa is a team of polar opposites. The Hawkeyes might have an elite defense but their offense is far from elite. So far this season it ranks dead last in the Big Ten averaging a measly 232.4 yards per game. The ‘Cats who are second worst in this category have averaged a much more respectable 307.4 yards per game — a number in line with other programs including Minnesota Indiana and Michigan State. Iowa’s offense has failed to be prolific in any capacity since they lost transfer quarterback Cade McNamara to a torn ACL leaving Deacon Hill to take his place. In the three games that Hill has started the Hawkeyes have averaged just 15 points per game and have only escaped due to their dominant defense. The program has already announced that offensive coordinator Brian Ferentz the son of longtime head coach Kirk Ferentz will be let go at the end of the season. This decision being made in October – while the Hawkeyes still have four regular-season matchups remaining and likely a bowl game awaiting them – is telling. With that in mind the onus is on the Northwestern defense to keep Iowa’s offense dormant. The Wildcat defense held its own against Maryland but did struggle at times against the arm of Taulia Tagovailoa and a strong passing attack. The Northwestern defense will need to play some complementary football of its own and limit any opportunities for Iowa to score. Firstly it will require the pass rush – which got to Tagovailoa five times last week – to push Hill outside the pocket into uncomfortable situations. The strong secondary must also play its part and force the receivers and tight ends into tight coverage. Given that Hill’s completion percentage thus far rounds to a lowly 38% this shouldn’t be immensely difficult but could be vital in giving NU the edge. If Hill can evade some of these troubles and exploit Northwestern’s defensive weaknesses Iowa could be in pole position to emerge victorious.  Northwestern and Iowa vs the over/under line This game is quite a rarity as both teams face a common enemy – the over/under scoreline. Sports betting companies have set the over/under at 29.5 which comes in as the lowest in college football history. Given that Northwestern just put up 33 points against Maryland this might seem unusual. However Iowa’s defense is exceptional and could throw a significant wrench in Northwestern’s plans. Things could also go the other way if NU’s defense can shut down the Iowa offense and provide them with no ability to elude pressure and make game-changing plays. It may seem ridiculous to make this one of three matchups to watch for but it is an indicator of how this game might play out. There is a very good chance that this will be a gritty low-scoring game that tests the resolve of both defenses to keep their teams alive until the end. It also foreshadows a game that will be close throughout enabling both teams an opportunity to break out and pull ahead. It will be up to Sullivan and Hill’s unit to prove this somewhat shameful number wrong. Yet there is plenty of reason to believe the under wins here. Both of these teams have played games below the line so far this year (Northwestern vs. Nebraska and Iowa vs. Wisconsin) and based on each team’s strengths and weaknesses it could absolutely happen again.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story For the uninitiated collegiate fencing features flurries of exhibitions — bouts and duels that mean nothing toward a school’s record or NCAA ranking but plenty toward the development of players that populate Division I (and other) rosters. In reality that pretty much encompasses all of October fencing as Northwestern usually doesn’t even start tallying its collective record until the annual Western Invitational.  To kick off exhibition season Northwestern traveled to Penn State last week and hosted the Remenyik ROC/RJCC the Saturday and Sunday prior. In those contests the ‘Cats fared well to the tune of individual podium finishes at each event. The spotlight was all on the freshmen in those two contests as sabre Alex Chen outperformed star sophomore Megumi Oishi at Remenyik and Adele Bois snagged a solid silver medal in the junior sabre category. As NU’s swords headed into the season’s first North American Cup (NAC) hosted monthly they each sought to continue fine-tuning their jabs and slices against some of the nation’s best competition. With the Western Invitational put on by Air Force this season this weekend the October NAC was the last chance for members of the team to gear up for what’ll hopefully be a long year. Six of Northwestern’s fencers entered the Division I sabre competition and the veterans reclaimed their status as the team’s stalwarts. Sky Miller a senior and a frequent podium-finder offered up NU’s best performance. The North Carolina native finished No. 23 in a field of well over 150. On her tail was Oishi who grabbed No. 32 in the event. Kailing Sathyanath a junior from New Jersey and Bois finished No. 52 and No. 55 respectively. The remaining ‘Cats placed in the 80s. ""A surprise was due in the foil category as first-year Karina Vasile snagged the top finish among Northwestern’s five entries. Vasile stayed off the award sheet in her first two meets and while a 28th-ranked finish isn’t a podium spot it certainly is eye-catching in an event featuring dozens of the nations top foils. Behind Vasile was another freshman Erika Castenada who finished No. 63. Then came the usual suspects — Rowan Park (No. 67) and Yejine Lee (No. 73) — with Samantha Serban rounding out the pack at No. 81."" In the much-anticipated épée division Northwestern’s roster had its hardest time. The top finish came courtesy of Anna Damratoski a sophomore from New Jersey. She latched on to a 64th-place finish. Freshman Ava Wade-Currie was close behind ending at No. 68. Karen Wang who served as a cornerstone of the program last season interestingly finished No. 81. The other two ‘Cats participating in the category finished below 160th. It was a telling weekend for Northwestern. Strong freshman finishes must have head coach Zach Moss excited for what’s ahead. Unlike these notable debut successes however the veteran showings were different. Aside from Miller who flexed in the sabre contest upperclassmen didn’t garner quite the finishes they or Moss might’ve been hoping for. With the Western Invitational — the first meaningful duel of the season — coming up on Nov. 4 and Nov. 5 Moss and Co. look to polish up in order to take on a tough slate of competing schools. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story There seems to be a similar pattern developing in Northwestern’s season. Following a week where the ‘Cats got swept by No. 2 Nebraska but took a five-set thriller against Michigan the Wildcats experienced some deja vu when they met Ohio State and Indiana. The Buckeyes easily got ahead of the Wildcats on Wednesday winning each set by 12 or more points. On Sunday the ‘Cats narrowly beat out the Hoosiers in the last two sets to stay .500 on the season.  Ohio State set the tone of the matchup from the beginning getting out to an early 3-1 lead. NU however equalized the playing field with a kill from Leilani Dodson and service ace from Drew Wright.   The two Big Ten rivals went back and forth once more but a five-point run from the Buckeyes certified their dominance in the match. The ‘Cats continued to gather kills from Dodson Maddy Chinn Rylen Reid Averie Hernandez and Alexa Rousseau with four from Hernandez and three from Dodson in total over the first set. Yet NU never came close to closing in on Ohio State which won 25-13. The second set was similar to the first. The Buckeyes jumped out to a 6-1 lead with Chinn adding a kill for Northwestern. But the ‘Cats didn’t have a strong enough answer to stop Ohio State. In claiming the set 25-12 OSU achieved multiple scoring streaks including ones of four and five points.  Northwestern trailed closely for the first four points of the final set tying the match twice at two and four. Ohio State then put up straight four points but Kathryn Randorf answered with two of her own. That is the closest the score would be as six straight points from the Buckeyes helped secure their lead and a 25-13 victory. The Wildcats seemed bluntly outmatched against the Buckeyes having just a .091 hitting percentage. While Emily Londot Chelsea Thorpe and Rylee Rader gathered 22 10 and eight kills respectively to lead Ohio State Hernandez led Northwestern with seven.  The return to Evanston was a much-needed momentum booster for the ‘Cats. Northwestern started out the first set strong winning 25-23 after beginning with a two-point lead off a kill from Randorf. Indiana stayed close behind and NU was holding on to just a 9-8 lead before a kill from Randorf and two attacking errors gave it another three points. The small four-point advantage at 12-8 gave the Wildcats an edge as the set continued. The Hoosiers eventually retied the score at 21 and then 22 but two attacking errors and Randorf’s fourth kill of the set secured a win.  The second set was all over the place featuring 14 ties and six lead changes. The Hoosier started off with a quick 5-0 lead but eventually a 6-0 run that featured three kills put the ‘Cats ahead 9-7. It took three times of equalizing the score for Indiana to finally overtake Northwestern. Yet after falling behind 21-20 NU went on another four-point run. At 24-21 the set was close to being over but Indiana tied it up once more. The Hoosiers finally won the set 34-32 after eight more ties.  Indiana was able to carry its success into the third set. The Hoosiers tacked on the first point and the Wildcats were only able to even the score at 1 and 10. Despite keeping the game as close as 23-21 towards the end of the set Northwestern was never able to get ahead leading Indiana to claim another set 25-21.  The Hoosiers needed just one more set to win but the Wildcats prevailed. NU propelled itself to an 8-4 lead amassing kills from Randorf Dodson and three from Hernandez along with a serve from Dodson. Indiana came within one point twice but Northwestern went on a four-point run to go back up 15-10. The Hoosiers continued to closely trail the Wildcats even making it 19-18 and 20-19 but were never able to get over the hump allowing NU to push a fifth set at 25-22.  Northwestern easily carried the momentum from the fourth set into the fifth. Indiana had a 2-1 lead but a kill from Dodson and two from Hernandez put NU along with an Indiana error up 5-2. The Hoosiers pulled in close at 6-4 but the ‘Cats unleashed a 3-0 run on kills from Dodson and Rousseau and an attacking error fueled by a block from Rousseau and Kennedy Hill. The Hoosiers would come within two points three more times but could not make anymore leeway. Thanks to two service errors NU was up 13-10 before delivering two unanswered kills from Hernandez to win 15-10.  Hernandez Dodson Hill and Chinn all tallied double-digit kills in the win. The ‘Cats and Hoosiers were evenly matched committing 74 and 70 kills and nine and 11 service errors respectively. Ultimately Northwestern was a tad more efficient.

Share this story Holy s**t. As the clock turns to November this piece sure has a different tone than when I wrote the first installment of the 2023 season. When I sat down to write that piece my optimism regarding Northwestern football was at an all-time low. Even though I predicted a record of 4-8 which was the highest win total by any Inside NU contributor I could have easily been convinced that the Wildcats were destined for another 1-11 season. On paper the roster was worse than the 2022 squad and the entire offseason was engulfed by a hazing scandal that led to the unceremonious firing of the winningest head coach in program history. To be frank 2023 felt like a lost season before it began going through the motions before a new head coach took over in 2024. Sitting in the Rutgers press box during Week One it sure felt that the ‘Cats were headed for another abysmal record. Now no one could have predicted how good the Scarlet Knights would be this season but Northwestern looked horrible. As I drove home from that game I seriously debated whether this team would pick up a single victory this season. Flash forward two months later the Wildcats sit at 4-4: just two or maybe even one win away from going bowling. Each Saturday brings an emotional rollercoaster making a heart jump and sink for 60 minutes as you wonder whether this team can find a way to eke out a win. Even undermanned — and trust me they are undermanned — the ‘Cats are playing meaningful football in the final month of the season.  If I haven’t put it in writing yet I will right now: Northwestern football has completely shocked me this season. I was wrong about this team. After the 33-27 Maryland upset and press conference I found myself sitting in the parking lot chatting with the West Lot Pirates. Still trying to process what just happened we all came to a similar conclusion — Northwestern would not have won that game in previous years. As I sat down at home to write the gamer I couldn’t. I couldn’t find the words to describe what happened because I still didn’t believe it. Maryland was the better team but the Wildcats outplayed the Terps for 60 minutes. Sitting here 96 hours later I still haven’t fully comprehended what occurred on Saturday; however saying that the ‘Cats have surpassed expectations is an understatement. As much as the players have outperformed expectations I would be remiss to not talk about coaching. Replacing a 17-year head coach who was the face of the University is hard. Replacing him after a hazing scandal rocked the program is even harder. David Braun who had never coached a down of FBS football was thrown into the deep end needing to steady the ship and get NU ready to play football. Sure he hasn’t been perfect but he has brought a style of play that Northwestern desperately needed. This team simply does not quit and that is a reflection of its head coach.  Talking to players throughout the season it is obvious how much they love playing for Braun. He has kept the group focused bouncing back after each defeat with a victory. If he can get the ‘Cats to a bowl which I expect him to do he should be the Big Ten Coach of the Year. And if that happens Derrick Gragg should not hesitate to remove the interim tag from Braun’s title. Especially with the circumstances he was dealt Coach Braun has been a revelation for NUFB.  Alongside Braun multiple coaches new to Evanston have reinvigorated their position groups. Take the Maryland game for example the Northwestern D-line was carried by low-level transfers former walk-ons and true underclassmen. In most Big Ten programs this is a recipe for disaster yet defensive line coach Christian Smith has this group getting better each week. I have been so impressed with Coach Smith and the job he has done in the trenches. Receivers coach Armon Binns has turned the receiving corps from a weak point of this team to one of its biggest strengths. If you had told me in June that NU would have one of the best pass-catching groups in the Big Ten I would have laughed in your face.  Even Mike Bajakian who has not been good in past seasons has improved this season. There have been multiple times this year where I left the game saying Bajakian called a good game. Sure there are definitely some calls he wants back and the execution needs to be better but he has set the ‘Cats up to succeed. He appears to be calling plays more freely. Even in his role as QB coach Bajakian’s group has improved in the fundamentals something that was lacking in the past years. It hasn’t been a huge leap but the better QB play is the reason Northwestern sits at 4-4. In a span of two months Northwestern went from a potential punt season to fighting for bowl eligibility in November. This squad has shocked me and I will never count them out again in 2023. Coach Braun and the players keep telling media members “Everything we want is still ahead of us.” As unfathomable as it was eight weeks ago they are right. So buckle up folks and enjoy the rest of the ride. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Only Thieneman made it out of the second round but Goli put up an impressive underdog fight in a match that went to three sets against Ohio State’s Alexander Bernard the top player in the tournament. Thieneman was not done however. In the Round of 16 he survived a second-set scare against Lucas Horve of Illinois winning 6-2 4-6 6-1 and advancing to the quarterfinals where he would face off against Bryce Nakashima of Ohio State. Thieneman fell 6-2 in the first set but he rallied to win the second set 6-3. The third set came down to the wire and in heartbreaking fashion Thieneman fell to Nakashima 7-5 ending Northwestern’s hopes at winning the singles bracket. In the doubles draw Northwestern had three pairs ready for battle: Blekher and Caldwell Thieneman and Nordby and Goli and Miller. All three advanced to the Round of 32 by scores of 8-3 8-2 and 8-4 respectively. Only one of the three duos would make it to the Round of 16. Blekher and Caldwell fell 8-4 to Chase Thompson and Yu Zhang of Notre Dame while Goli and Miller lost in an 8-6 thriller to Michigan State’s Ozan Baris and Max Sheldon. Thieneman and Nordby blew past Depaul’s duo of Shourya Verma and Sven Moser by a score of 8-3 en route to the Round of 16 where Thieneman would face a familiar foe in Bryce Nakashima and his partner from Ohio State Robert Cash. Despite a valiant effort to avenge the singles quarterfinals loss Thieneman and Nordby could not come away with a win as they fell 8-3 to the Ohio State duo who ended up reaching the semifinals. Looking ahead this Wednesday the Wildcats will travel to San Diego as they compete in the ITA National Fall Championships against some of the top talent across the nation.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Maybe! Share this story Northwestern sits at a balmy 4-4 after an improbable 33-27 victory against Maryland last Saturday placing the ‘Cats a mere one game back from the Big Ten West title with four games to play. Is it likely that they win the division? Probably not but Brendan Sullivan and his Heisman-caliber handlebar mustache have Wildcat faithful believing anything is possible. Here’s how Northwestern can get it done: The path for the ‘Cats is a lot easier if they win out. As it stands after Week Nine Northwestern sits in fifth place in the West with two conference wins. It is one game behind Iowa Nebraska Minnesota and Wisconsin who are tied for first place in the division with three conference wins. Northwestern doesn’t control its own destiny in the division as it only has two of the four first place teams left on their schedule (Iowa and Wisconsin) meaning that the ‘Cats would need losses from Minnesota and Nebraska to get the job done. The primary tiebreaker in the Big Ten is head-to-head so the ‘Cats would only need Minnesota to lose one of their remaining four games if they win out. Fortunately the Golden Gophers face third-ranked Ohio State on the road in three weeks and I really can’t see a world where P.J. Fleck’s guys can steal a win in Columbus.  Nebraska poses a bigger problem. In the first year of the Matt Rhule era in Lincoln the Cornhuskers appear to have a legitimate shot to win the Big Ten West. Since Northwestern lost to the Cornhuskers in Week Eight it would need Nebraska to finish no better than 2-2 the rest of the way. Nebraska is only projected to win one of their remaining four games according to ESPN FPI with that one win coming this Saturday on the road against a struggling Michigan State team. However Nebraska seems to have found their stride in recent weeks ripping off three wins in a row after an embarrassing 45-7 loss to Michigan. The Huskers play at Michigan State home vs. Maryland at Wisconsin and home vs. Iowa in their final four games. Northwestern needs the Cornhuskers to cool off and lose at least two of those games to keep the dream alive. To summarize the path to Indy in this scenario: It gets a little more complicated for the ‘Cats if they go 3-1 down the stretch and the path to the promised land varies substantially depending who they lose to. Yet no matter who that one loss comes against Nebraska and Minnesota would each need to lose one more game apiece meaning the red-hot Cornhuskers (relatively of course – our little brothers from Lincoln haven’t made a bowl game since 2016) would have to go 1-3 in their final four games and Minnesota would have to finish 2-2.  The Golden Gophers are 3-1 since they fell to Northwestern most recently taking down No. 24 Iowa 12-10 in a classic Big Ten West shootout. They have Illinois Purdue and Wisconsin left on their schedule in addition to their date with Ohio State. ESPN FPI projects them to go 2-1 in their non-Ohio State matchups beating Illinois and Purdue while losing to Wisconsin.  If Northwestern loses to Wisconsin or Iowa Iowa and Wisconsin are by far Northwestern’s most important games remaining as those two teams are ahead of the ‘Cats in the West. If Northwestern were to lose either game the winning side would have to lose out to keep the ‘Cats in contention. If Northwestern beats Iowa at Wrigley but loses to Wisconsin in Week 11 it would need Iowa to lose at least one other game and need Wisconsin to lose each of its three remaining games.  Both Wisconsin and Iowa are favored by ESPN FPI in each of their remaining four games. Iowa’s offense remains archaic and Brian Ferentz may be a dead man walking but I can’t see a world where Iowa goes 0-3 against the gauntlet that is Rutgers Illinois and Nebraska. Wisconsin is a 9.5-point road favorite against 2-6 Indiana who has lost four straight games (though the Hoosiers did give Penn State a scare last week). Wisconsin also has Nebraska left on its schedule which means that if the Badgers beat Northwestern they must also lose to the Cornhuskers. Realistically Northwestern must get victories against Iowa and Wisconsin to keep its title hopes alive. To summarize the path to Indy in this scenario: If Northwestern loses to Purdue or Illinois  As much as I’d like to believe that David Braun is the reincarnation of Bear Bryant and Northwestern will run the table the ‘Cats’ most realistic path to Indy probably includes a loss somewhere along the way. If that loss comes against either Purdue or Illinois the two teams sitting at the bottom of the West the ‘Cats have a reasonable if not convoluted path to Big Ten West glory.  The Nebraska and Minnesota problem would remain the same in this hypothetical where NU loses a game to either Purdue or Illinois: Northwestern would need two losses from the Golden Gophers and three from the Cornhuskers.  Wisconsin and Iowa would both need to lose at least two more games including both of their respective games against Northwestern. Purdue and Illinois each only have one conference win at the moment and if either team were to beat Northwestern they would still need to win out the rest of the way to snatch the West. Purdue still has Michigan left on their schedule so barring a vintage performance from the Spoilermakers in Ann Arbor Northwestern should not have to worry about the Big Ten West team from Indiana in this scenario.  Illinois however plays Iowa Minnesota and Indiana before its battle with the ‘Cats on Thanksgiving weekend. In an ideal world the Illini would lose to Indiana – who are in the Big Ten East and do not pose a threat to Northwestern’s title aspirations – and help the ‘Cats out by winning one of their games against Iowa and Minnesota. To summarize this mess of a scenario the path to Indy in this scenario is: There is a ridiculous hypothetical that has been circulating on Twitter where Northwestern can “win” the West in a seven-way tie by going 2-2 in their remaining four games. Unfortunately I am pretty sure that Purdue would come out on top winning the worst tiebreaker in human history to book a trip to Indy at 5-7 (the math here is insane so I’m relying on playoffpredictors.com). I don’t know if a non-bowl-eligible team has ever played in the Big Ten championship and I don’t really want to find out but what a fitting conclusion it would be for the wackiest division in Power 5 college football. In this dream/nightmare scenario Northwestern would win against Purdue and Wisconsin and lose against Iowa and Illinois. Would Northwestern hang a banner to celebrate one-seventh of a Big Ten West title? After what transpired this offseason I’d bring out all the stops. Hang that banner parade through the streets of Evanston replace the Arch with a 20-foot tall statue of David Braun. March through the Arch? I’d rather watch the class of 2028 walk through a Colossus-style statue of the greatest interim coach in college football history.  Realistically though the 2023 football season should be considered a success for the ‘Cats regardless of whether or not they book a trip to Indianapolis. Northwestern was picked to finish last in just about every single Big Ten season preview and it’s borderline miraculous to be even entertaining dreams of a Big Ten West title eight games into the season. I’d build that 20-foot statue for Braun if his guys are able to scrape out two more wins and earn a trip to a bowl game. The fact of the matter is that Northwestern is playing meaningful football games in November for the first time since the pandemic and in a season that began under such a cloud of uncertainty that alone is reason for celebration.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story With the women’s basketball exhibition game on Thursday we’re continuing our player preview series. Next up is Caroline Lau a sophomore guard who flashed throughout last season. Who is she? Sophomore; guard; 5-foot-9; from Westport Connecticut  2022-23 Stats 30 games played three starts 20.8 minutes per game 5.7 points per game 2.9 rebounds per game 2.6 assists per game 0.6 steals per game 35.1% FG% 31.3% 3PT% 65% FT% 2022-23 Review As the No. 91 recruit in ESPN’s Class of 2022 prospect rankings Lau entered Evanston with high expectations. Northwestern looked for her to flash signs of becoming the program’s point guard of the future given it had just lost Veronica Burton and Kaylah Rainey was entering her final season.  It took time but that’s what Lau did. She immediately displayed great passing talent in non-conference play averaging three assists in her first six games despite playing just 16.7 minutes per contest off the bench. However early turnover and shooting struggles made Lau’s adjustment to the collegiate level difficult. NU’s late-December blowout loss to Ohio State which hounded her with its press and forced the first-year into four turnovers encapsulated her rough transition. Eventually though Lau worked through those tough games to put up some eye-popping performances toward the end of the season.  She dropped 13 points in 22 minutes at then-No. 2 OSU and scored 12 in a loss to Penn State but her best performance came on Jan. 25 against Chicago State in an 87-64 win — a game that she started. In just 27 minutes Lau blossomed with 20 points seven rebounds six assists a steal and two blocks on 6-of-10 shooting. She also went 3-of-6 from three-point land. It was the first game of Lau’s Northwestern career where she illustrated the sky-high heights she could reach as an all-around offensive player.  While Lau continued to struggle with ball security and decision-making as the season drew to a close she built on the Chicago State game by doing a little bit of everything down the stretch. She recorded two steals in four of her last 10 contests and she went on a six-game stretch where she averaged north of four rebounds a game. Northwestern struggled mightily on offense all year and Lau wasn’t immune from that but she had a number of moments that hinted she’s capable of leading the way toward righting the ship. Strengths Lau is a point guard who thrives most when working in open space. When she gets out in transition she tends to shine as a ball-handler and as a facilitator by beating defenders and setting up Northwestern’s paint scorers for easy looks. Lau’s assist percentage last year ranked in the NCAA’s 91st percentile and a bunch of her feeds came when she had ample room to work with. If NU’s shooting was better she likely could have had even more. The sophomore also has the potential to light it up from long range. Her 31.1% mark from beyond the arc wasn’t great but it was also the second-best mark on the team in 2022-23 behind Rainey who won’t be back this year. With the first year under her belt that mark could definitely improve. At her best Lau is the most offensively talented guard on the entire team. Frankly Lau’s ability to gradually get better was her most impressive quality in her first season. The overall statistical improvement is outlined above but Lau’s growth between the two games she played against Ohio State really highlights why Northwestern fans should expect a significant jump from her. In the home matchup she didn’t score in 19 minutes and turned the ball over four times as mentioned above. However when the ‘Cats went to Columbus Lau’s 13 points and five rebounds came on 5-of-9 shooting without a single turnover. Entering Year Two Lau should make some serious strides in multiple facets of her game. Weaknesses Lau really struggled to consistently make good decisions throughout 2022-23. In nine of her 30 games she turned the ball over at least four times. Considering Lau came off the bench in almost all of those games that’s even more discouraging. While her speed made her electrifying in the open floor it was also a source of many of those giveaways. Playing out-of-control led to her dribbling into traps or simply losing the ball. Furthermore that pace of play probably hindered Lau’s shooting mark at the rim which stood at just 36.5% last year. Although she was consistently able to beat defenders to find paths inside No. 2 didn’t often draw fouls or finish well in traffic. To be fair to her that might have been a result of defenses collapsing inside without strong shooters around her stretching the floor but Lau has to improve her finesse inside to become NU’s primary scoring weapon. Expectations Lau will almost certainly be Northwestern’s starting point guard for the next three years and she’ll get her first chance to lead the way this season. Considering she’s the team’s first sophomore captain since Burton in 2019-20 it’s clear that Lau is already a leader in the locker room and that McKeown expects big things from her.  Simply put the offense will go as far as the PG goes. Lau will need to complement Caileigh Walsh well on both sides of the ball for the Wildcats to improve from their 2-18 Big Ten record last season. The Big Ten is loaded with great backcourt players so if Lau can climb up to the middle of the pack of floor generals in the conference NU should be looking at a better record come March.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Week Eight of the NFL season has come and gone and there are some new names in the column! Let’s take a look at what the NU alumni accomplished in the league over the weekend. Rashawn Slater: Los Angeles Chargers OT Slater had an easier time protecting Justin Herbert’s blindside in Los Angeles’ 30-13 drubbing of the Bears. As always the iron man played all 69 offensive snaps and allowed just one pressure all game. However he continues to struggle avoiding the referees’ whistle. Slater was called for just seven penalties in 19 career games leading up to this season but he’s already been dinged four times in seven games this year.  This week Slater was called twice for offensive holding (one was declined). A nagging ankle issue has left him less fleet of foot than usual forcing him to grip onto his opponents for a second too long at times. Slater will have an extra day to recover this week before the Chargers take on the Jets on Monday night. Week Nine matchup: at New York Jets (Monday 7:15 p.m. CT) Peter Skoronski: Tennessee Titans OG Skoronski helped create a clean pocket during rookie Will Levis’ first career start and a 28-23 win for the Titans. He held down the interior for all 68 offensive snaps and gave up two pressures but he was not responsible for any sacks.  Tennessee tied for second in the AFC South at 3-4 could be turning a corner with Levis as the starting QB. If Skoronski continues to excel at protecting his fellow rookie he should be in line for an All-Rookie selection at season’s end. He and the Titans will look to keep their momentum rolling into a Thursday night matchup at Pittsburgh. Week Nine matchup: at Pittsburgh Steelers (Thursday 7:15 p.m. CT) Ben Skowronek: Los Angeles Rams WR Skowronek is back on the column after catching a 20-yard TD during the Rams’ embarrassing 43-20 loss to the Cowboys. He capitalized on his five offensive snaps shaking Dallas cornerback Jourdan Lewis on a dig route to haul in the first receiving touchdown of his NFL career. It was Skowronek’s first target since Week Five and he took advantage earning the top PFF grade on the Rams’ offense (78.6).  The third-year receiver also recorded two tackles (one solo) on special teams playing 70% of the snaps on that unit. Between the blowout loss and quarterback Matthew Stafford leaving with a thumb injury it wasn’t the ideal afternoon for the Rams. Nonetheless Skowronek will try to build on the momentum he accumulated in at Lambeau Field in Green Bay. Week Nine matchup: at Green Bay Packers (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Greg Newsome II and Cameron Mitchell: Cleveland Browns CB Newsome managed to record a solo tackle and a pass deflection before exiting Cleveland’s 24-20 loss to Seattle with a groin injury. Mitchell stepped in for his injured teammate notching two solo tackles. Mitchell came this close to snatching his first NFL interception in the third quarter. He jumped Seattle receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba’s route reaching across his body to grab Geno Smith’s errant pass. But the ball bricked off his hands preventing a likely pick-six that would’ve put the Browns up 26-17. Mitchell will fill in for Newsome on Sunday against the Cardinals if the latter can’t recover in time. Week Nine matchup: vs. Arizona Cardinals (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Anthony Walker Jr.: Cleveland Browns LB After playing every snap last week Walker saw the field for a more reasonable 74% of the Browns’ defensive action. He recorded four tackles (two solo) and made his first tackle for loss of the season. Walker finished with a lackluster PFF grade of 49.6 as Cleveland’s defense struggled as a whole to contain Geno Smith and the Seahawks. Walker and the Browns will face a less intimidating offense in the Cardinals where fifth-round rookie Clayton Tune will likely make his first NFL start. Week Nine matchup: vs. Arizona Cardinals (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Godwin Igwebuike: Pittsburgh Steelers RB Igwebuike saw action as the Steelers’ kick returner for another week during their 20-10 loss to the Jaguars. His one opportunity came in Pittsburgh’s final possession of the first half when Brandon McManus booted a kick deep into the end zone. Igwebuike darted to the Steelers’ 32-yard line for a 36-yard return which is the team’s longest this season.  Though Chris Boswell would miss the field goal as time expired Igwebuike still gave his team a chance to put points on the board. Anthony McFarland who started the season as Pittsburgh’s kick returner could return for Thursday’s clash against the Titans. If he can’t go Igwebuike will look to impress the Steelers with every chance he gets. Week Nine matchup: vs. Tennessee Titans (Thursday 7:15 p.m. CT) Joe Jones: Tennessee Titans LB This is Jones’ first appearance on this season’s column as he was signed to the Titans’ practice squad last Monday and called up for their game against the Falcons. The seven-year veteran played 14 snaps on special teams and assisted on a tackle before exiting with a hamstring injury. Jones played for Northwestern from 2013 to 2016 consistently earning more playing time with each new season. As a fifth-year senior he recorded 46 total tackles two sacks 4.5 TFLs two pass deflections and a fumble recovery. Jones went undrafted in 2017 and has bounced around the league — the Titans are his sixth squad. Depending on the severity of his injury he could miss Thursday night’s game in Pittsburgh. Week Nine matchup: at Pittsburgh Steelers (Thursday 7:15 p.m. CT) ‘Cats that didn’t play this week (or record any stats): Dean Lowry (Minnesota Vikings) Earnest Brown IV (Los Angeles Rams) Evan Hull (Indianapolis Colts torn meniscus) Adetomiwa Adebawore (Indianapolis Colts) Blake Hance (Jacksonville Jaguars) Ifeadi Odenigbo (New York Jets injured reserve) Tyler Lancaster (Denver Broncos) Joe Gaziano (Atlanta Falcons) Trevor Siemian (New York Jets) \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He’ll look to keep improving in an increased role this season. Share this story Who is he? Junior; 6-foot-6; from Lafayette Indiana; returning to NU 2022-23 stats 34 games (0 starts) 24.2 minutes per game 7.6 points per game 4.9 rebounds per game 1.1 assists per game 0.4 blocks per game 0.8 steals per game 41% FG 31% 3P 83.6% FT 2022-2023 review Barnhizer was excellent in his role off the bench last year proving to be a solid option for Chris Collins to turn to. Not only was he productive offensively Barnhizer was a great hustle player with good instincts and a noticeably high basketball IQ. He was always in the right spot. He played good help defense. He was a voracious rebounder. There’s a reason he saw north of 24 minutes a night off the bench. Admittedly Barnhizer has not yet proven to be a complete player. Similar to many other young players in college basketball he has been a streaky scorer at times. He also lacks to an extent the physical traits to guard the Big Ten’s most athletic guards and forwards. He can have a bit of a jerky play style as well that sometimes puts him in bad situations from a turnover standpoint. Barnhizer was far from perfect last season but it’s hard not to get excited about a guy who made as big of a jump as he did in his sophomore season. He was a solid contributor on a tournament team whose best basketball was played towards the end of the year. There was a lot to like. Strengths Barnhizer’s intelligence on the floor is perhaps his most intriguing strength. It’s an intangible that some just have and luckily for the ‘Cats Barnhizer has it. When you combine that with his effort and hustle you get the kind of player we all saw last year. Barnhizer is always going for the loose ball. He’s constantly scraping around for boards. It sounds like a cliche sports-ism but Barnhizer truly makes an impact doing the little things. As an offensive player Barnhizer isn’t necessarily elite at anything yet but his jump shot can get hot and he knows how to drive in the lane. His ability to hang tough among the trees is where he’s at his most impressive. Additionally he’s developed into a free throw shooter you can trust at 83.6 percent. On the defensive side of the ball Barnhizer isn’t a flashy player per say. His defensive averages don’t show that he’s forcing a lot of takeaways or blocking a lot of shots. But Barnhizer moves his feet well understands the Northwestern defensive system and consistently executes it. He’s someone who certainly isn’t prone to making mistakes. Weaknesses Barnhizer’s jumper while statistically speaking is not awful could use some work. It’s not that it’s bad but his hitchy shooting form seems to lack consistency. It almost reminds me of a leg kick in baseball. If he has it timed up right and it’s feeling good then he’s a pretty good shooter. If not then he’s usually off. As mentioned earlier since he plays with his hair on fire he’s prone to some bad turnovers or other awkward plays with the ball. He absolutely should not stop playing like Brooks Barnhizer but hopefully the errors will naturally occur less and less as he continues to gain experience (remember he’s only a junior). Defensively again he’s not a bad defender and I’d go as far as to say he adds value at that end. But due to his presumptive role as the starting four this year I’m a little concerned about his size and his ability to handle big athletic forwards in the paint. It’s something to keep an eye on as the season gets rolling. Expectations Expect Barnhizer to take another step up. How significant of a step is tough to predict but I think he’ll be even better this season than he was last year. He will likely slot into the starting lineup at the four slightly out of position but probably not too much for him to handle. It’s a mild concern but not a big one. Barnhizer will also have to step up in the locker room. Named one of the captains on Monday he will have an expanded leadership role in the absence of some of the veterans from last year. Expect him to fulfill that role well. Barnhizer has always been a pretty well-spoken even-keeled guy and Collins speaks glowingly of him as a person. Overall Barnhizer is a big piece for the ‘Cats this season. If he can take another step up as an offensive contributor he lengthens the lineup a lot. His versatility gives him a leg up but consistency will be the key. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Olsen @InvrrtedFB  Nov  1, 2023, 11:04am CDT      / new",Men’s soccer: Stumbling into postseason play, Martin Stadium will host men’s Big Ten Tournament soccer for the first time since 2019. Share this story The end of the regular season was not kind to Northwestern. After an unbeaten run of 12 games to start the year the ‘Cats faltered losing three of their final four. They capped off that stretch — in which they scored just three times while conceding eight — with a 3-0 defeat at Michigan throwing away a golden chance at a Big Ten title. However all of that is in the past now. Entering the conference tournament the Wildcats get a clean slate and can just focus on one thing: winning the game directly in front of them. That “survive and advance” mentality will be crucial regardless of what the ‘Cats aim to achieve in the rest of the year. For an NCAA Tournament appearance this is especially true as NU’s ticket is far from secure as an at-large team. With the Wolverines traveling to Evanston for a Big Ten Tournament quarterfinal matchup in addition to a semifinal berth Northwestern will be seeking revenge for Sunday’s loss discussed below. Sunday Oct. 29 (Ann Arbor Mich.) The soccer gods are a funny bunch. All year NU has relied on rather unsustainable methods to win games. All year I have been saying the lack of control the ‘Cats assert over the ball and territory would eventually catch up with them. While my claims haven’t necessarily been proven or disproven a higher power seems to have been ensuring Northwestern gets its fair share of negative variance to even out the good luck it had earlier in the season. Further it appears this deity (or deities) is trying to make this regression to the mean as painful as possible by sprinkling in some false hope. After back-to-back 2-1 defeats to Penn State and Michigan State both of which featured Wildcat defensive errors leading to goals a miraculous 1-0 win against Indiana put them back within striking distance of the conference title. But this is exactly what the gods wanted. With the ‘Cats just needing to match the Nittany Lions’ result at Wisconsin which ended up being a draw to win a Big Ten title disaster struck in Ann Arbor. That’s right — Northwestern got Northwestern-ed. Michigan was far from an impressive outfit. The Wolverines’ in-possession play (4-2-4/4-1-2-3) was more or less nullified by a solid Wildcat 4-3-1-2 press and although they managed to do the same to NU that’s not much of an accomplishment as evidenced by now 16 matches of subpar attacking from settled play for the ‘Cats. While I wouldn’t say Northwestern was dominant the run of play certainly favored the visitors. None of this mattered though as Michigan was able to exploit the opportunities it was given and it felt all too familiar from an NU perspective. After pouncing on transitions defensive errors and just plain bad luck for a while it was the ‘Cats who suffered from the same exact situations this time. The home side broke the deadlock after a Wolverine was allowed to get a free header from eight yards out and it doubled its lead soon after as a Collin McCamy deflection carried a shot past Jackson Weyman’s outstretched hands inside the far post. Once again Northwestern was down 2-0 at the break to a team from Michigan and with a conference title on the line it really started to get desperate. Payne cycled through personnel combinations and attacking structures searching for something that would generate some genuine threat but nothing really gelled. Wolverines eventually added a third — with admittedly a nice back heel finish — exploiting the space left behind NU’s extremely high defensive line. When I first started working on this article I anticipated writing about how the ‘Cats could right the wrongs of this game in the upcoming rematch but honestly they shouldn’t have to change a lot. And even if they were going to make changes it wouldn’t be in line with my one suggestion — not allowing the Michigan press to force them wide keep the ball centrally and have forward players make movements corresponding to that aim — because they love playing down the wings. With Martin Stadium hopefully filled with purple and a desire to get back at the team that denied it a trophy I’m cautiously optimistic the ‘Cats prevail Friday. Looking beyond that I have no clue what might happen. But hey that’s one-off tournament soccer for you.

Share this story 1. Michigan (8-0 5-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 1 Last Result: 49-0 win at Michigan State Next: vs. Purdue Michigan had a bye week to reflect on its 49-0 blowout win of in-state rival Michigan State but considering it has another weak opponent in Purdue coming up it can be said the Wolverines didn’t need it. In the team’s win Heisman hopeful quarterback J.J. McCarthy threw for 287 yards and four touchdowns while the defense held the opposition to just 133 yards in the air. We could see a repeat of this next week when the Wolverines face a Purdue defense that has allowed the most points per game in the Big Ten. 2. Ohio State (8-0 5-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 2 Last Result: 24-10 win at Wisconsin Next: at Rutgers The Big Ten’s other undefeated team opted for a slow burn of a middling Wisconsin team scoring a touchdown apiece in the last three quarters to seal the victory. The Kyle McCord–Marvin Harrison Jr. tandem was as strong as ever as McCord found Harrison Jr. twice in the end zone. The Buckeyes will face a much tougher opponent in Rutgers next week and they might look to run the ball more against one of the conference’s best passing defenses. 3. Penn State (7-1 4-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 3 Last Result: 33-24 win vs. Indiana Next: at Maryland Aside from their loss to Ohio State this last matchup against a bottom-feeding Indiana team has given Penn State the biggest run for its money. After taking a flimsy 17-14 lead into half the Nittany Lions were finally able to limit the long ball stifling the Indiana offense until garbage time. Penn State has a chance to regain control again when they travel to College Park hoping to take advantage of a weak Maryland passing defense. 4. Iowa (6-2 3-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 4 Last Result: 12-10 loss vs. Minnesota Next: at Northwestern Coming out of a bye week offensive coordinator Brian Ferentz seems to be nearing the end of his tenure but the Hawkeyes will likely still be good enough to make a bowl game. One of the Big Ten’s stingiest defenses didn’t allow a single touchdown in the team’s 12-10 loss to Minnesota highlighting its issues on offense. Iowa will face a tougher passing defense when it comes to Evanston to face Northwestern but the defense could find a way to shine against a middle-of-the pack Northwestern passing game. 5. Rutgers (6-2 3-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 5 Last Result: 31-14 win at Indiana Next: vs. Ohio State It’s now Week Nine and Rutgers has yet to slow down. They narrowly pulled out a win against a bumbling Michigan State team in Week Eight but a dominant three-touchdown fourth quarter cemented the Scarlet Knights’ place in the conference’s second tier. The magic carpet ride will probably come to a halt next week when Rutgers welcomes Ohio State to town but it’s still likely to make a bowl game if it can shut the door against some weaker opponents coming up. 6. Maryland (5-3 2-3 B1G) Last Ranking: 6 Last Result: 33-27 loss at Northwestern Next: vs. Penn State Oh how the mighty have fallen. There were calls for Maryland to be ranked when they started off the season 5-0 but after three straight losses to Ohio State Illinois then most recently Northwestern those sentiments seem to be all but forgotten. Despite quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa’s continued success the cracks in the Terrapins’ defense have been exposed not only by Ohio State’s Kyle McCord but by some lower tier quarterbacks in Luke Altmyer and Brendan Sullivan. Not a recipe for success going forward. 7. Minnesota (5-3 3-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 8 Last Result: 27-12 win vs. Michigan State Next: vs. Illinois Minnesota has taken a step back since their hot start to the season but if it can continue to dispatch weaker opponents like it did to Michigan State last weekend it should still be able to finish with a respectable record. The Golden Gophers will test that theory in their next two matchups against Illinois and Purdue likely by utilizing their strong ground game against two of the weakest rushing defenses in the conference. 8. Nebraska (5-3 3-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 9 Last Result: 31-14 win vs. Purdue Next: at Michigan State Just like Minnesota Nebraska has been feasting on its weaker opponents and has the chance to finish off the season strong if it can continue to do so. It easily dispatched Purdue with three touchdowns from the offense as well as another from a blocked field goal. The Cornhuskers face another weak opponent in Michigan State next week which will provide head coach Matt Rhule with another opportunity to take advantage of a very weak passing defense. 9. Wisconsin (5-3 3-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 8 Last Result: 24-10 loss vs. Ohio State Next: at Indiana Wisconsin continued its inconsistency in Big Ten play with a home loss to Ohio State but didn’t get blown out in the fashion that similar teams have. The defense refused to let the Buckeyes pull away limiting them to just one score per quarter but the Braedyn Locke-led offense had no answer for Ohio State’s brick wall defense. The Badgers have a solid chance to rebound against a struggling Indiana team next week. 10. Northwestern (4-4 2-3 B1G) Last Ranking: 12 Last Result: 33-27 win vs. Maryland Next: vs. Iowa Northwestern came into Saturday’s home matchup against Maryland as a heavy underdog but aside from a quick Maryland score on the first drive of the game the Wildcats never really relinquished control. Backup quarterback Brendan Sullivan had the game of his life in starter Ben Bryant’s absence popping off for a career high 265 yards and two touchdowns on 16-of-23 passing to give the ‘Cats a one-score victory. If they can put on this kind of offensive performance against Iowa next week it’ll almost guarantee them a win. 11. Illinois (3-5 1-4 B1G) Last Ranking: 11 Last Result: 25-21 loss vs. Wisconsin Next: at Minnesota Despite their 3-5 record Illinois has been playing some better football as of late. The Illini took down Maryland on the back of a solid performance by quarterback Luke Altmyer and they would’ve beaten Wisconsin if not for a fourth quarter collapse. The defense has looked better at the start of games and it seems to run out of steam late. But Luke Altmyer and the offense have been keeping the team competitive in the second half which could give Illinois the edge in Minnesota next week. 12. Purdue (2-6 1-4 B1G) Last Ranking: 10 Last Result: 31-14 loss at Nebraska Next: at Michigan The Boilermakers’ struggles continued in a blowout loss to Nebraska last week and things will likely get worse before they get better as they prepare to travel to Michigan next weekend. One of the Big Ten’s bottom-four defenses proved to be no match for an elite Nebraska ground game a weakness that running back Blake Corum and the Wolverines will certainly look to exploit. 13. Indiana (2-6 0-5 B1G) Last Ranking: 13 Last Result: 33-24 loss at Penn State Next: vs. Wisconsin Surprisingly Indiana was able to put up a fight against a juggernaut Penn State team in Happy Valley. Quarterback Brendan Sorsby torched the Penn State secondary for three touchdowns and 269 yards on 13-of-19 passing while receivers DeQuece Carter and Donaven McCulley combined for 200 receiving yards. Based on the result of this past game it’s not crazy to say that the Hoosiers have a shot against Wisconsin at home next week. The Badgers’ offense has been underperforming and if Sorsby can measure up to last week’s breakout they could pull off an upset. 14. Michigan State (2-6 0-5 B1G) Last Ranking: 14 Last Result: 27-12 loss at Minnesota Next: vs. Nebraska The Spartans suffered their sixth straight loss on Saturday this time at the hands of an upstart Minnesota squad. Starting quarterback Katin Houser was unable to mount any sort of attack and their only touchdown came out of the arm of backup Sam Leavitt. Michigan State will face a very similar team when it welcomes Nebraska to town next week hoping to break out the slump that started with the suspension of head coach Mel Tucker. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Northwestern Wildcats basketball is back and expectations are high for the first time in years. The Wildcats’ 2022-23 campaign saw them finish with a 22-12 record (12-8 in the Big Ten) including four top-20 wins over the course of the regular season. Northwestern fans are ready for the action to return as they expect that same terrific season to repeat itself but there are some major factors to be considered before any assumptions can be made about NU’s basketball season. At the forefront of everyone’s minds regarding Northwestern’s 2023-24 squad is one looming question: what will the Wildcats do now that star guard Chase Audige is gone? Audige was nothing short of prolific for the ‘Cats last season — he was the second-leading scorer and assister and was the Big Ten’s Co-Defensive Player of the Year — and after being named to the All-Big Ten Second Team the redshirt senior declared for the NBA Draft and is currently rostered by the Washington Wizards’ G-League team.  Meanwhile Northwestern is left without one of its key components from a team that was responsible for the school’s second-ever NCAA Tournament appearance the first being in 2017. Looking ahead now there remains plenty of question marks on the roster especially regarding who will step up as the number-two option alongside fifth-year senior guard Boo Buie. One potential answer may just be Brooks Barnhizer. Though he saw limited action in his freshman season in 2021-22 Barnhizer made massive leaps in the midst of a breakout sophomore year. Practically all of his major statistics made noticeable jumps including minutes per game points per game field goal and three-point shooting percentages and rebounds per game. If the Lafayette Indiana native can continue to make positive strides as he enters his third season of Big Ten basketball the capabilities for Northwestern especially on the offensive side of the ball are endless — even without Chase Audige. Another defining characteristic of Northwestern’s season was its electric home wins: Illinois Wisconsin No. 14 Indiana and of course No. 1 Purdue. The Wildcats went 13-5 at home. Recreating that same magic though it’s obviously no guarantee could be a difference-maker for Northwestern’s 2023-24 campaign. One thing that makes some of today’s premier Big Ten programs so successful is their scary home environments. Whether it’s Purdue’s Mackey Arena the RAC for Rutgers or Indiana’s infamous Assembly Hall having a home-court advantage could be massive to replicate the movie-like finishes that the Wildcats had.  At a first glance it isn’t obvious why Northwestern was as successful as they were last year. Though it was toward the bottom of major categories such as scoring field goal and three-point shooting and rebounding margin the Wildcats thrived the most in the turnover game and capitalized on it.  NU was first in the conference in turnover margin last season sporting a +4.29 margin which was a head above the rest of the pack (second-place Wisconsin’s margin was +3.17). With speedy athletic guards who also knew how to protect the ball like Buie Audige Barnhizer and Ty Berry the ‘Cats were absolutely stacked with talent at the guard positions. This year they bring back three of their five rotational guards and add Denver transfer Justin Mullins to the mix as well a sophomore guard who averaged nearly 10 points per game in his first year of college basketball.  Overall there isn’t any guarantee that the Wildcats have as magical a season as they did last year: after all it was arguably the most successful basketball season in school history. But head coach Chris Collins and crew definitely have an opportunity to replicate something special assuming things go their way.    \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Coming off a disappointing 13th-place finish at the Golf Club of Georgia Collegiate Invitational the ‘Cats looked to rebound at the Cal Poly Invitational at The Preserve. The 15-team tournament had a solid field with four of the top 25 squads in the country participating.  Northwestern had a tough opening 18 holes ending the round in solo 12th place at 6-over par collectively. With a total of six birdies and three in a row to close his round junior Cameron Adam led the team with a 1-under par 71. Sophomore Ethan Tseng also had a solid round shooting even-par 72 and closing his day out with two birdies in a row. Heading into round two Northwestern was 14 shots behind first-place Oregon. The ‘Cats had a terrific second 18 holes and shot 9-under 279 as a team. They were led by Tseng who shot a 4-under par 68. Sophomore Daniel Svärd also had a great round shooting 3-under par. His round was highlighted by two eagles: at the par-5 eighth and par-5 15th holes. Even with a great second round the ‘Cats only moved up to 10th place and 11 shots behind UCLA. The team saved its best round for last. Northwestern shot a single round tournament-best 13-under par 275 in the final round. Svärd led the way with a bogey-free 6-under par 66. Adam also had a fantastic finish shooting 4-under par and making eight birdies in his final 18 holes. Graduate student James Imai had his best round of the tournament and contributed a 3-under par 69. By shooting 13-under par the ‘Cats vaulted up the leaderboard and finished in a tie for second with UCLA five shots back of first-place California.  In individual play Daniel Svärd and Cameron Adam led the Wildcats and each finished at 7-under par. Like Northwestern as a team Svärd didn’t have the best start to his tournament with a 2-over par 74 but he finished strong. In round two Svärd made two eagles and three birdies and shot 3-under par 69 for the day. His final round was tied for the best round of the tournament as he shot 6-under par 66. He made three birdies in a row from holes 8-10 and his three round total of 7-under par was good enough for a tie for sixth place.  Adam had a consistent and quality three rounds to finish at 7-under par. In round one he shot 1-under par 71 after a great stretch on the first three holes. In the second round Adam made 4 birdies and shot a 2-under par 70. Adam’s final round was his best. He started his round at the 4th hole and made birdies on holes four six seven and eight to be 4-under par through his first five holes. He played even-par golf for the next 13 holes and shot 4-under par for the day. His great day led to a tie for sixth-place finish with Svärd at 7-under par. Ethan Tseng also had a superb three rounds shooting 4-under par throughout the tournament. In round one Tseng made four birdies and shot an even-par 72. The second round was Tseng’s best of the tournament. He made five birdies and an eagle to shoot 4-under par 68. In the final round Tseng finished his last hole of the tournament with one of his three birdies of the day and shot even-par. Tseng had a great three rounds finishing at 4-under par and in a tie for 15th. James Imai had a great final day to finish at 3-over and in a tie for 46th in the tournament. In his first round Imai shot 6-over. However Imai was able to respond in round two by making four birdies and shooting even-par 72. In his final 18 holes Imai had his best round of the tournament. He shot a 3-under par 69 that was highlighted by a birdie-eagle stretch on holes seven and eight.  First-years Archie Finnie and Niall Shiels-Donegan also competed in the tournament with Finnie finishing in a tie for 73rd and Shiels-Donegan placing 75th. Finnie’s best round was his second 18 holes where he shot 3-over 75 with two birdies. Shiels-Donegan started off the tournament with his best round and after making three birdies during the day he shot a 2-over 74.

Share this story Over the summer I was watching Secret Base’s brilliant docu-series “History of the Minnesota Vikings” when something caught my eye (I highly highly recommend checking out the whole series if you have the time — it’s worth your while). About 15 minutes into Episode Five Jon Bois tells the story of former Vikings coach Dennis Green who made a pit stop at Northwestern before rising to the NFL ranks. If you don’t have the opportunity to check out 90 seconds from the hyperlink above the gist of the section is this: on the heels of a 34-game losing streak spanning multiple seasons in the early eighties in 1982 Dennis Green led Northwestern to a 3-8 record and as Bois perfectly puts it “[The voters] said ‘Wait you won three games at Northwestern? Holy s---! You win Big Ten Coach of the Year. Congratulations.’” Setting aside the 34-game losing streak which is awfully hard to do this got me thinking. How many wins would David Braun need to accumulate to be awarded for his coaching accomplishments in 2023? Of course the Big Ten looks a lot different now than it did in ‘82 — back then it was actually 10 teams. But now that Braun has passed Green’s winning output from over 40 years ago and has this Northwestern team on the cusp of bowl eligibility I’m going to build the case for David Braun potential Big Ten Coach of the Year. I’m not saying this will or even should happen. I’m just laying out the facts and you can do whatever you’d like with it. Throw a parade? Fine by me. Burn your reading device? To each their own.  Step One: The Easy Cross-Outs Let’s start with the low-hanging fruit. Here is a list of Big Ten coaches you can bet the mortgage that will not win Coach of the Year: The two Indiana team leaders Walters and Allen simply fall out of the race due to poor performance. Indiana has yet to win a conference matchup and Walters’ first year in West Lafayette has been a major struggle. Barnett was thrown into an undesirable situation following the midseason firing of Mel Tucker but he has been 0-6 since taking over so scratch him off. Illinois technically could go on a 4-0 run to close out the season against a moderate schedule but the Fighting Illini would still need some help to win the Big Ten West and I don’t see that undefeated run happening. Jim Harbaugh is certainly the trickiest of the bunch. Michigan could very well finish the regular season 12-0 and cruise to a conference title including a win over Ohio State. Even if that happens I don’t see Harbaugh winning the award for a few reasons. First of all Harbaugh won it last year and usually coaches are rewarded for turning a program around or exceeding the previous year’s record. Second Harbaugh was suspended for the first three games of this season amid an NCAA investigation so his record is technically only 5-0 at the moment. Last not sure if you’ve seen it but uhhhhh... There is an even worse scandal brewing in Ann Arbor for potential sign stealing. All that and I’d be shocked to see Harbaugh honored by the season’s end. Technically possible but there is work to be done Here’s the next list of guys I am more tentatively crossing out in pencil — most of these coaches do have a path to the award but for whatever reason I don’t see it happening: Let’s break these down one at a time. For Iowa and Ferentz the team might finish 10-2 but it’s hard to argue that Ferentz has elevated this roster any more than usual. The team has the same defensive identity with the same offensive struggles. The Hawkeyes have enjoyed an easy conference slate without either Ohio State or Michigan on the schedule. The one ranked team they did face off against then-No. 7 Penn State blew the doors off the Hawkeyes 31-0. Five weeks into the season Locksley looked like the favorite for this award as the Terps jumped out to a 5-0 start. Since then Maryland has hit a wall dropping three straight matches including losses to both Illinois and Northwestern. With Penn State and Michigan still on the docket it looks like Maryland will finish with a losing record in conference play. For Minnesota it’s been more of the same. While the Gophers could go on a run to claim the Big Ten West title that dream will most likely fall short with remaining matchups against Ohio State and Wisconsin. A bad loss to Northwestern earlier in the year most likely seals the deal. The only way Franklin wins this award is by winning out beating Michigan (unlikely in my opinion) and having Michigan beat Ohio State (much more possible) in order to activate a three-way tie that might go in PSU’s favor going all the way down to the fifth tiebreaker. It’s quite the long shot and the 2023 Penn State story is the same one we’ve grown accustomed to the past few seasons: drum up early season hype and subsequently fall flat against Ohio State and Michigan. In my opinion that leaves five legitimate candidates for the crown. The true contenders Let’s break each of these resumes down in order of weakest chance of winning to strongest (of course in my subjective opinion): 5. Luke Fickell (Wisconsin) — I wanted to put Fickell in the previous group but Wisconsin’s remaining schedule makes Fickell’s inclusion in this section necessary. With a remaining lineup of Indiana Northwestern Nebraska and Minnesota Wisconsin could very well finish 9-3 and 7-2 in conference play. Although at times I’ve been underwhelmed by Fickell’s team in his first season in Madison it’s hard to ignore a new coach boosting a team’s regular-season win total by three full games. Begrudgingly I’m keeping Fickell as a contender knowing that a single loss makes him a cross-off in my book. 4. Matt Rhule (Nebraska) — You can copy and paste a lot of what I just said and apply it to Rhule as well. The only differences? First with a tougher remaining schedule Rhule has the chance to impress voters with matchups against Maryland Wisconsin and Iowa. Second the Cornhuskers went just 4-8 in 2022 making Rhule’s turnaround even more impressive. Nebraska has played well as of late winning five of the last six but you’d probably think a 3-1 record would be the minimum for Rhule to garner consideration. 3. Ryan Day (Ohio State) — This one just comes down to one thing: beating Michigan. If the Buckeyes take care of their rival on the road and finish 12-0 Ohio State will likely go on to win the Big Ten and enter the CFP as the top-ranked team with the strongest resume in college football. In that case give Day the award — fine by me. If Ohio State loses “The Game” and Day’s record against Michigan drops to 1-3 you can probably write Day off even if Ohio State is still able to sneak into the playoffs. 2. David Braun (Northwestern) — Maybe this is optimistic but I’m inclined to think voters will have a ton of respect for the job Braun has done in Evanston after being thrust into head coaching duties with less than two months to prepare for opening day. It hasn’t been pretty but Northwestern sits at 4-4 already a three-game improvement from the 1-11 record under Pat Fitzgerald in 2022. After losing four players to the NFL (Peter Skoronski Adetomiwa Adebawore Evan Hull and Cameron Mitchell) Braun might still end the year with the single-biggest wins improvement in the conference. If Northwestern loses to Iowa this weekend am I going to jump off this bandwagon? Heck no. Looking at Northwestern’s remaining four games (Iowa Wisconsin Purdue and Illinois) with three or four wins deliver Braun the award on a silver platter. 2-2? Yep still has my vote as getting this team to a bowl game would have been unfathomable before the season. Even if NU goes 1-3 and finishes out at 5-7 I can still make the argument a la Dennis Green that there was no better coaching job in the Big Ten in 2023 relative to situation. 1. Greg Schiano (Rutgers) — If this award were handed out today I think Schiano gets it. Rutgers sitting at 6-2 has already earned bowl eligibility and improved on the 4-8 record from a season ago. The team has looked completely different in his fourth season (of his second stint) in Piscataway. That said Rutgers’ remaining schedule is a gauntlet of Ohio State Iowa Penn State and Maryland. It would be optimistic to suggest Rutgers could split those four games though I do think a 7-5 Rutgers season is still deserving of praise and potential hardware. With the remaining schedule diminishing there is still so much up for grabs in the Big Ten. Of course both division races are still wide open and double-digit teams could reach a bowl game. On the individual level J.J. McCarthy (Michigan) and Marvin Harrison Jr. (Ohio State) are both in the mix for the Heisman and the Big Ten will also hand out conference-specific honors. Although many of these races should be close if the previous 1600 words didn’t illustrate it I think the Coach of the Year competition is the one to watch.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After a crucial victory over Maryland the Wildcats head to the friendly confines to take on the Iowa Hawkeyes. To get us set for this Big Ten showdown Inside NU spoke to The Athletic’s Scott Dochterman to fill us in on Iowa. INU: Despite its struggles Iowa is already bowl-eligible at 6-2. What is the mood in Iowa City and how do Hawkeye’s fans feel about the state of the program? Dochterman: The feelings are mixed right now because of the offensive issues. The excitement over whether Iowa could win the West Division is somewhat muted because of what inevitably awaits the Hawkeyes – or any West Division champion – in Indianapolis. But I would say feelings have altered somewhat after this week’s events and many fans now are more excited for the future. INU: Obviously the big news this week was Brian Ferentz being fired as offensive coordinator. What went wrong this season? Is there any part of Iowa’s offense that the Wildcats should fret? Dochterman: The Hawkeyes’ offense has been on a downward spiral the last three years because of multiple reasons. This year specifically season-ending injuries to quarterback Cade McNamara and tight ends Luke Lachey and Erick All have taken away any real hope of a decent passing game. The scheme is old and tired and the playcalling hasn’t helped.  The Hawkeyes’ running game is much improved but didn’t show it against Minnesota because the Gophers sold out against the run. Iowa did nothing in the pass game to make the Gophers pay for it which is part execution and mostly play calling. INU: Defensively the Hawkeyes have been one of the best in the nation despite losing top talent to the NFL. What has the defense done well and how can NU counter? Dochterman: This is one of the most collectively solid defensive units I’ve covered at Iowa. At all three levels the Hawkeyes are good but not necessarily dynamic. They are fundamentally sound at every position and rarely get beat. They’re not as prolific in rushing the passer as last year and no player can replicate Jack Campbell but they’re disruptive up front and middle linebacker Jay Higgins has filled Campbell’s role as well as anyone could.  The one element Northwestern brings that could give Iowa some issues is the RPO quick-passing attack with a capable runner at QB. But you’ve got to be patient against Iowa’s defense which is difficult to do over four quarters. INU: You can’t talk about Iowa without talking about punts. How can Northwestern neutralize Cooper DeJean in the return game?  Dochterman: Kick it out of bounds? Haha. He’s a tremendous threat every time he touches the ball. He could be an All-American as a defensive back punt returner or if the Ferentzes let him as an offensive performer. I’d either punt out of bounds or sky high without regard for distance and force him to fair catch. You don’t want to give him the ball and 10 yards of space or he’ll make you pay. INU: This is the lowest over/under in college football history. What is your score prediction and do you think the under hits? Dochterman: With Iowa football you just keep predicting the under and you might miss once but you’ll end up ahead in the long run. Unless there are multiple turnovers I don’t see Iowa scoring very often. Likewise unless there are big plays or a couple of defensive scores I don’t see Northwestern putting up many points on Iowa. Let’s just give the offenses each three field goals and I’ll say DeJean does something either on defense or special teams and Iowa pulls out a 16-9 win. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story For 40 minutes it looked like Northwestern was on the verge of Big Ten Tournament heartbreak yet again. But it only took three golden minutes for the Wildcats to shut those doubts down. A flurry of three goals near the end of the third quarter propelled No. 1-seeded Northwestern (17-1 8-0 B1G) to a 3-1 Big Ten semifinal victory over No. 5-seeded Ohio State (14-6 4-4 B1G). The ‘Cats will advance to their second-straight Big Ten final and will look to win the tournament for the first time since 2014. Northwestern has never won the Big Ten regular season title and Big Ten Tournament in the same season. Annabel Skubisz had a remarkable day with 10 crucial saves allowing just one goal after Northwestern put the game out of reach. Although Ohio State won the shots-on-goal battle 11-6 relentless pressure from Peyton Halsey opened up the game for NU. The senior led the team with five shots three of which were on goal and one of which got past the goalie. Two of the other three — from Lauren Wadas and Ilse Tromp — all found the back of the net. Lauren Hunter and Alia Marshall each had two assists. Leanne Bough Makenna Webster and Hallie Brost each put up three shots on target for the Buckeyes. Brost scored the team’s lone goal which Webster assisted. In just about 90 seconds Ohio State found its way into the circle for the first time. However Skubisz kicked it away. Through the next few minutes both teams struggled to generate much offense until Mackenna Webster drew a corner. Katie Rodjik’s ensuing shot was blocked by the NU defense which set the tone for the first half. The Buckeyes were able to keep the ball in Northwestern’s half throughout but rarely found clean looks. NU’s best chance came on a play in transition from Olivia Bent-Cole. The first-year sped off in transition and beat a defender to set up a chance near the goal but she just missed Chloe Relford on the far side. The ‘Cats failed to put up a shot in the first despite earning a corner. The second quarter was much of the same story. Northwestern struggled to connect on passes in the midfield which allowed the Buckeyes to dominate possession. Ohio State earned consecutive corners but the defense knocked away one and Skubisz saved the other. Although Northwestern drew two corners in the period Ohio State’s offensive performance put the defense under a ton of pressure. Two green cards from Wadas gave the Buckeyes two 11-on-10 advantages. Three saves from the Big Ten Goalkeeper of the Year — two of which came while she was on the ground — kept the score even going into the half. Heading into halftime Ohio State had outshot the Wildcats 7-3 and 4-1 on goal. Northwestern’s press and counterattack — two of its biggest driving factors behind its offense all year — were relatively quiet. It seemed inevitable that OSU would break through unless Tracey Fuchs made some adjustments to reverse the momentum. That’s exactly what she did. For a moment it seemed like not much had changed when Ohio State’s Hallie Brost forced Skubisz to make another save on a loose ball. Gradually though Northwestern’s attack picked it up. A green card on Webster gave NU an advantage which Peyton Halsey appeared to cash in on with a shot that found the back of the net. However the officials waved it off due to an infraction and her next shot was wide. Halsey’s miss would be Northwestern’s last missed opportunity for the foreseeable future. With about 3:30 left in the third NU drew a corner. Marshall and Hunter set up Tromp who flicked a bullet of a shot that found the back of the net. Less than 40 seconds later NU worked its way into the attacking half to draw yet another corner which Wadas cashed in to double Northwestern’s lead. Somehow the ‘Cats still weren’t done. Ohio State drew a corner but the defense blocked another shot from Rodjik. That jumpstarted a golden opportunity in transition. Crisp passing created a fastbreak which Halsey capitalized on with a goal off a feed from Bent-Cole. Northwestern had opened up a 3-0 lead in the blink of an eye. Ohio State continued to generate offensive momentum in the fourth quarter as it drew four corners. Eventually it broke through with about six minutes to play when Brost deposited an assist from Webster to make the score 3-1. The Buckeyes worked their way inside the circle a few more times but Northwestern’s defense held strong to send the Wildcats to their second straight Big Ten Championship. The top-ranked Wildcats will face the winner of the second semifinal between No. 2-seed Rutgers and No. 3-seed Maryland on Sunday at 11 a.m. CT.

Share this story Welcome back to the film room everybody. After a brutal loss in Nebraska Northwestern looked to bounce back in a Halloweekend matchup against Maryland and bounce back they did. The ‘Cats took down the Terps 33-27 and its quarterback was a big reason NU came away victorious. Yes you read that correctly. With Ben Bryant out another week with an upper-body injury Brendan Sullivan was under center for the Wildcats — and he balled. Without a question Saturday was the best game of Sullivan’s career. After two poor showings this season the junior displayed how good he could be. I’ve watched a lot of Brendan Sullivan tape over the past two seasons but I’ve never been more excited to dive into his film from this weekend. This should be a fun piece so get some popcorn and let’s talk about high-level QB play. The Numbers It was a career day for the gunslinger finishing the game 16-for-23 for 265 yards and two touchdowns and adding 63 yards on the ground. His 265 yards were 100 more than any game he has started and his efforts earned him a 78.1 PFF passing grade — the highest by a NU quarterback this season. The junior’s yards per attempt skyrocketed to 11.5 yards this week the highest by a ‘Cat this season. Sullivan had three big time throws (a pass with excellent ball location and timing generally thrown further down the field and/or into a tighter window) but had a turnover-worthy play as well. It was another week of Sullivan facing heavy duress facing pressure on 48.5% of snaps. The ‘Cats’ starter only completed 33% of his passes when facing pressure; although he completed 60% of his pass attempts when he was blitzed — which was over 63% of the time. When protected Sullivan completed nearly 93% of his passes for over 200 yards.      No. 6 was lights out pushing the ball down the field going 5-for-7 on 10+-yard passes. Here is a breakdown of every pass the junior tossed on Saturday. Last week I said that the tape told a completely different story than the stats did; however this week they line up perfectly. Let’s not waste any more time and dive into the tape. The Good After struggling to find positives last week there is so much to talk about this week. Sullivan balled against the Terps and deserves his flowers. This has always been the part of Sullivan’s game where he excels. He is able to make plays when the play breaks down and this weekend was a prime example of how good he is with his legs. This was an absurd play from Sullivan. With the Terps in man coverage Northwestern runs a vertical concept play side. Despite rushing just four Maryland collapses the pocket and flushes Sullivan to his left. With a defender in his face the junior resets his hips and uncorks a bomb to A.J. Henning who makes a phenomenal diving grab. Not only does Sullivan keep the play alive with his feet: he delivers a dot while being crushed. There are not many QBs in college football who can make this throw; luckily for Northwestern No. 6 is one of them. SIT. DOWN. YOUNG. FELLA. This is a really good blitz design from Maryland but Sullivan is able to make chicken salad out of chicken s**t. The Terps bring six including one on a twist stunt and overwhelm the ‘Cats’ O-line. This should be a sack but the junior evades the rush and escapes through the front of the pocket. As he turns into a runner the QB makes a defender eat dirt with a nasty stiff arm and scampers for an 18-yard gain. In prior starts Sullivan bailed out of the pocket backward and lost yards; this time he continued to move forward and turned it into a fresh set of downs. It is a minute detail but it shows that he is continuing to improve in the pocket. That is a great sign for his development and for the ‘Cats. This another freak play from Sullivan. Maryland brings seven and NU only has five protecting so there are two free rushers instantly. One of the rushers shoots right through the A gap into the junior’s face. No. 6 is able to scramble right before the defender clobbers him rolling right as more Terps inch closer. Even with a defender wrapped around his legs going to the ground the ‘Cats’ signal caller miraculously flips it to Cam Porter for a walk-in touchdown. This is a perfect play call by the Terrapins but Sullivan was able to stave off a sack once again. There should not be a way this turns into a positive play yet the Wildcats got six out of it. In the box my jaw dropped watching this play because no one should be able to make this play — but Brendan Sullivan did. There were multiple throws where Sully dropped the ball in a bucket. Despite tight coverage NU’s receivers came away with a catch because their QB put it right on target. ‘Cats fans just stop and admire this throw. Maryland is in man coverage and Cam Johnson runs a simple go route. With a clean pocket Sullivan looks play side works his way back side hitches and tosses a dime to Johnson. This ball could not be placed any better even if the QB handed the ball to the WR. He puts just enough air on it to get it over the corner in coverage and gets enough zip for the ball to beat the high safety to the spot.  There is nothing either defender can do because the throw is perfect. I was in awe during the game and I am even more in awe watching the tape back. Furthermore this was not the only dart he threw on Saturday. Nothing Mike Bajakian loves to dial up more than the fake screen post-wheel concept at the edge of the red zone.  The Terps were again in Cover One and the Wildcats made them pay. Sullivan executes a good pump fake and Bryce Kirtz beats his defender inside on a post. With another clean pocket the junior tosses a pass right to Kirtz in stride for a touchdown. This is a much more difficult throw than people think: too much on it and the receiver runs out of room too little on it and the corner can undercut it. Sullivan does neither of these things and gives Kirtz enough room to get both feet down easily while allowing the corner no chance of making a play on the ball. It was at this moment in the game that I knew Sullivan was feeling it because there were multiple other starts in his career where he does not make this throw. Last season it felt that Sullivan was playing conservatively and taking the checkdown first. Now he is letting it rip and showing how strong his arm is. He makes one of these throws each week and it may be the difference between a win and a loss down the road. The Bad To be honest I am nitpicking here. Sullivan played extremely well but there is always room for improvement. While this has gotten much better in just a few weeks since Sullivan has taken over under center the junior is sometimes too quick to get out of the pocket. His biggest weakness is that when he bails the pocket he often is heading in the wrong direction. If you look up the word jittery in the dictionary this play shows up. Maryland brings four but the offensive line picks it up with ease. Sure the nose tackle gets a little penetration but this is a clean pocket. You see Sullivan try to step up which is the correct decision but then decide against it and start running backward. He creates pressure for himself and ends up having to throw the ball away. Because he puts his eyes down and starts moving backward Sullivan effectively ends the play. He can’t see what his receivers are doing so he has to just heave it out of bounds. This simply cannot happen. Northwestern is in chip shot range and Sullivan almost takes them out of field goal range entirely. Maryland does a great job at penetrating the offensive line overwhelming the ‘Cats. I know Sullivan is trying to make a play on third down but as soon as the interior defensive lineman flushed No. 6 from the pocket the ball should be tossed out of bounds; instead he keeps running farther behind the LOS and allows the edge rusher to join in the pursuit and send him even closer to midfield. By the time Sullivan finally throws the ball away he is 20 yards behind the line of scrimmage. There should never be a play where the QB has to throw a stiff arm to avoid a 20-yard loss but Sullivan did. He is lucky he got away with it this time but teams already have and will continue to make him pay for going the wrong way. If you have read any of my quarterback breakdowns over the last 18 months you know that nothing drives me more insane than when quarterbacks do not throw the RPO when they should. Well here we are again. Northwestern has three on the outside and Maryland has two. This is a pre-snap read Sullivan has to make. When there is a numbers advantage on the outside get the ball out there to your playmakers in space. If he throws the screen it is an easy five-yard gain with the potential for a big play; instead the Wildcats pick up one on an inside zone. It is simple but it drives me crazy every time I see it. If an offense has a numbers advantage take it. Final Thoughts I have been very critical of Brendan Sullivan since he stepped in for Bryant a month ago but he shut me up on Saturday. He played the position at an extremely high level and showed he can be a Big Ten-caliber quarterback. Consistency is now the key but for at least one week he proved all the naysayers wrong.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Although Boo Buie struggled to find his offensive groove against McKendree in exhibition play Agent Zero still managed 10 points on three-of-nine shooting and ran the offense with a game-high nine assists. Let’s dive into what makes Buie critical as Northwestern’s floor general and premier scorer this season. Who is he? Graduate student; guard; 6-foot-2; 180 pounds; from Albany New York; Preseason Third Team All-American; unanimous Preseason All-Big Ten Team selection (first Wildcat since Bryant McIntosh in 2017) 2022-2023 Stats 34 games (34 starts) 34.9 minutes per game 17.3 points per game 3.4 rebounds per game 4.5 assists per game 1.1 steals per game 40.6% FG% 31.8% 3PT% 86.9% FT%. 2022-2023 review In his senior season for the ‘Cats Buie blossomed into one of the country’s premier point guards finishing the campaign as a Bob Cousy Award Finalist and with All-Big Ten First Team honors. The four-year starter finished sixth in the the conference in points per game and fifth in assists per contest. Buie found his footing in mid-November’s non-conference action against Purdue Fort Wayne pouring in 28 points off 9-of-18 shooting and canning seven threes to surpass the 1000 career point mark with the ‘Cats. Just over two weeks later against Michigan State at the Breslin Center No. 0 dropped 20 points in Northwestern’s first Big Ten win of the season. But it wasn’t until conference play when Buie caught fire scoring 20-plus points in 11 of 16 games from Northwestern’s win at Indiana in early January to the squad’s heartbreaking loss to Penn State on March 1. During the ‘Cats’ five-game win streak in February culminating in historic wins over No. 1 Purdue and No. 14 Indiana Buie dominated posting 26 points four rebounds three assists three steals and three blocks against the Boilermakers — the first Big Ten Player in over a decade to tally 25-plus points 3-plus blocks 3-plus steals and 3-plus assists in a conference game. Against the Hoosiers Buie’s buzzer-beating right-handed floater in the game’s dying moments gave Northwestern another critical win fueling the program into the AP Top 25 for the first time since 2021. As Northwestern’s five-game win streak came to an end with a loss in Champaign Buie repping the nameless No. 4 jersey after his No. 0 jersey ripped dropped a career-high 35 points fueled by 6-of-11 shooting from deep. And in the NCAA Tournament Buie continued to lead Northwestern’s offense with a game-high 22 points against Boise State and team-high 18 points against UCLA. Finishing the season with 31 double-digit scoring games Buie’s 588 points scored last year ranked third-highest among single-season performances in program history. Strengths Buie is an offensive weapon. His ability to attack the rim finish with either hand in traffic and soft touch off the glass allows him to be an effective paint penetrator against the Big Ten’s best defenders. When his offense isn’t at its best Buie’s aggressiveness and relentless penetration off the dribble allows him to slow the game down and get to the line — where he’s among the best in the country finishing last season second in the Big Ten in free throw percentage. His 126-made free throws were the most in a single-season by a Wildcat since Evan Eschmeyer’s 208 from the stripe in 1998-99. On the perimeter Buie’s three point shooting is a major problem for opposing defenses when he’s feeling it from downtown. With deep range and an ability to create thanks to an explosive dribble defenses have to play Buie high allowing the floor general to dish the rock to open teammates. Buie’s talent forces defenses to focus on Northwestern’s superstar but Agent Zero’s vision and ability to dish the ball makes him a filthy facilitator. Add in his ability to shine in the biggest moments and Buie’s clutch gene makes him downright dangerous as Northwestern’s offensive dagger. On the other end of the floor Buie’s no slouch defensively. Although he’s not the same defensive weapon as he is offensively the New York native snagged 38 steals last season 14 more than the year prior. His hustle and competitiveness especially grabbing boards makes his tenacious style an asset to Northwestern’s chaos-inducing defense. Weaknesses For as good as Buie can be offensively his playmaking comes with a fair share of mistakes and mental lapses. On any given night when his game isn’t quite there Buie’s tendency is to force the issue and attack more causing outcomes like the star had at the Cancun Challenge scoring five points on 1-of-8 shooting from the field against Liberty and six points on 3-of-13 shooting against Auburn. Plus Buie can be sloppy with the ball turning it over 82 times last year 24 more times than the year before. Northwestern’s star needs to continue to look for his teammates and rely on their talent to open up his opportunities while struggling. Three-point shooting-wise Buie’s numbers regressed last season: the senior only converted at a 31.8% clip from downtown. That’s less than his 34.1% shooting from deep as a junior and 36.0% rate as a sophomore. Offensively Buie lacks efficiency for someone who attempted over 14 shots a game finishing the year 40.6% from the field. Compare that number to Terrance Shannon Jr.’s 44.2% shooting Tyson Walker’s 45.2% shooting and Jalen Pickett’s 50.8% shooting (albeit a different style of play) last season and it’s clear Buie needs to improve his effectiveness as a volume scorer. Although Buie isn’t a poor defender he’s not an elite All-Big Ten defensive talent either. That hasn’t been a problem playing alongside Chase Audige the past couple seasons. Without Audige’s defensive presence expect Buie to take a larger role clamping opposing elite talents that would’ve been Audige’s assignment — something that may be tough for him without Audige’s elite tools. Expectations Northwestern’s chances to become the first team in program history to make back-to-back NCAA Tournaments rely on Buie’s ability to carry the squad through the highs and lows of a Big Ten season. NU’s other pieces will certainly play a role but without their leader the Wildcats are nothing more than a bottom-end mediocre Big Ten team. Buie is lightning in a bottle. He can strike at any time giving the ‘Cats an uncanny ability to pull off upsets compete among the conference’s titans and hold their own in conference play. Without Audige Buie’s importance as a playmaker who can create for himself and those around him is paramount to the essence of how Northwestern’s offense functions. Expect Northwestern’s reliance on Buie’s ability to score at will to enable the superstar to finish as a top-three scorer in the conference in points per game. However if Buie fails to improve his efficiency from the field especially from deep Northwestern will struggle to stay competitive in high-scoring battles.  Already named to the Cousy Award Watch List Buie has a unique opportunity to follow up Northwestern’s program-record 12 conference wins and best Big Ten finish since 1959 last year as the face of Northwestern basketball. Currently in 10th place on Northwestern’s all-time scoring list Buie is well within John Shurna’s program-record 2038 career points mark only trailing by 497 points. If Buie is able to engineer another historic season he’ll have the ‘Cats back in the Big Dance and himself at the top of Northwestern’s record books. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You can make the case that NU could have gone winless in Big Ten play had she not starred against Minnesota (22 points and two steals in 25 minutes on 8-of-13 shooting) or on the road at Wisconsin (18 points 3-of-5 from three-point land). That’s not even including Northwestern’s tight Big Ten Tournament loss to Rutgers when Walsh almost pulled a Tracy McGrady with two threes in the final 75 seconds to cap off a 24-point eight-rebound game.  And when she was off Northwestern was off. Walsh especially struggled in both blowout losses to Ohio State when it came to shooting ball security and foul trouble. As the team’s primary source of perimeter offense she had to take on lots of defensive attention without getting to work inside as much as she could have which probably hurt her numbers. Walsh’s scoring average of 12.1 points per game doesn’t express how much the offense revolved around getting her good looks. Strengths Walsh is a really talented scorer who can dominate at all three levels on a great night. Northwestern especially thrived when Joe McKeown ran smaller lineups and sets that were focused on giving No. 10 room in the post to operate. When Walsh did so efficiently early in games it unlocked her perimeter game and gave NU’s offense a dimension that many of the Big Ten’s best teams don’t have. She was at her best when playing “inside-out” as McKeown liked to put it getting buckets in the post before finding deeper looks. At 6-foot-3 Walsh is also a really good rim protector. Her 1.2 blocks per game speak to her prowess as a paint defender. As a tenacious rebounder on both ends Walsh is also immensely valuable to a Northwestern team that seems like it’ll embrace a fast pace of play dependent on generating extra possessions. Simply put she’s one of the more versatile bigs in the Big Ten and she improved in nearly every area of her game in her sophomore season. Weaknesses In a word: inconsistency. One could chalk up nearly every single one of Walsh’s struggles last year to that. She never strung together two straight games where she shot over 45% from the field. Attributing that to her high usage in the offense is a valid argument but it’s really tough to string together consecutive wins in Big Ten play when your top scorer is inefficient. Giveaways and foul trouble also hurt Walsh. She played eight games where she committed four or more turnovers. Especially for a post player that’s extremely rough. That mark has to improve for NU to get better.  When it came to fouls Walsh fouled out four times and had a number of four-foul games. Obviously she’s Northwestern’s last line of paint defense which makes it unreasonable to expect her to cut down on the fouls. However avoiding foul trouble early could be crucial. Even in games where she shined on both ends but picked up multiple fouls early McKeown limited Walsh’s minutes a little more than you’d expect for a star player to ensure she’d be available later on. That could have made it much more difficult for Walsh — and the entire team — to find a rhythm early on in games. Expectations Chances are that Walsh will be the team’s best player once again. If she can take the same statistical jumps that she did from Year One to Year Two while also becoming a more efficient player then Northwestern might be in for a treat. The ‘Cats struggled mightily from beyond the arc in 2022-23 and their best player could very well be the focal point in the effort to turn that around. Some shooting around Walsh would allow McKeown to utilize her in a more post-centric role which in turn would open up the floor for her. Ultimately though the improvements Northwestern will make as a team start with her development. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story With the chance to get above .500 for the first time this season Northwestern welcomed Iowa to Wrigley Field in the midst of a chaotic Big Ten West race. Even with prognosticators projecting an all-time low scoring output the two teams combined for just 17 points as Iowa narrowly escaped the Friendly Confines with a 10-7 victory. Check out which stocks went up and which went down from the disappointing loss. Stock Up Bend-but-don’t-break defense In the first half Iowa reached Northwestern territory four different times and even reached the edge of field goal range. Each time the Northwestern defense held firm to keep the Hawkeyes off the board. On the opening drive a Jaylen Pate third down sack forced an Iowa punt. The very next drive Xander Mueller blew up an Iowa screen to force a loss of four on third down causing the Hawkeyes to miss the subsequent field goal. On drive Number Three Iowa bludgeoned down all the way to the Northwestern 26 but a beautiful play by Theran Johnson forced an interception to keep the game scoreless. Late in the second quarter on a drive that started in Wildcat territory an Aidan Hubbard first down sack stymied Iowa’s plans to eventually force a punt. Throughout the first half Northwestern came up with clutch plays to keep the game scoreless. Throwback football If you’re one of those people who likes to spend their Saturday kicked back on a leather recliner sipping prune juice complaining about the lack of defense in the Big 12 and missing the days of Chuck Noll and The Beatles you probably loved Northwestern-Iowa. Maybe “throwback” is acting as a stand-in for the word “awful” but let’s just rally off a few stats from... Whatever this game was: The Big Ten West as a comedic entity To put it plainly Iowa-Northwestern was one of the funniest college football games I’ve ever watched. It was funny in the darkest of ways but it was comedic nonetheless. Elsewhere in the West Wisconsin and Nebraska were both upset by bottom-of-the-barrel teams from the East in Indiana and Michigan State. Entering the game there was a scenario that involved Northwestern beating Iowa and Illinois beating Minnesota that would have resulted in a five-way tie atop the Big Ten West with a quintet of teams sitting at 3-3 conference records. With the Iowa win the Hawkeyes appear to be in the driver’s seat with only a couple of games remaining but in the topsy-turvy Big Ten West anything is possible. In the final season of the conference structure the funniest division in college football is delivering the goods. Honorable Mentions: Fourth quarter offense Wrigley Field the under Stock Down Defensive penalties The Wildcats finished the first half with five penalties for 51 yards four of which came on the defensive side of the ball. Northwestern was unable to get off the field due to two gut-punching pass interference penalties on the first drive of the game both coming on crucial third downs. On the second Iowa possession more of the same commenced as a second defensive pass interference penalty on Garnett Hollis Jr. allowed Iowa to advance the ball. The ultra-rare “sideline interference” penalty spotted Iowa another 15 yards later in the half. For a team that is already operating with a slim margin for error the messy mistakes did Northwestern no favors. Goal-line offense In the fourth quarter after a whole lot of nothing Northwestern put together a massive drive to reach the doorstep of the goal line. After a Cooper DeJean pass interference penalty Northwestern had four chances from the two-yard line to punch the ball in and tie the game. Here’s how the sequence went: First down: stuff Second down: stuff Third down: stuff Fourth down: stuff Not ideal! The 18-play 66-yard drive that took 9:24 off the clock ended with zero points on the scoreboard. To be fair Northwestern did redeem itself on the next drive with a touchdown pass from five yards out but that sequence was incredibly costly. Punting Not only did Northwestern punt eight times which naturally means eight different Wildcat possessions did not end in points but some of the game’s most crucial moments tilted the game in Iowa’s favor as a result of punts.  Early in the second half Iowa blocked Northwestern’s punt giving the Hawkeyes the ball at Northwestern’s 25 yard line. Iowa trudged its way down the short field for a touchdown to score the first points of the game. On the very next possession Northwestern finally got some offensive rhythm going gaining consecutive first downs and crossing the midfield line for only the second time all day. After  what looked like a first down conversion to Cam Johnson was overturned David Braun elected to punt on fourth-and-4 from the Iowa 46 instead of going for it. On the kick poor hands coverage allowed the ball to bounce into the end zone for a touchback leading to a net punt of just 26 yards hardly flipping the field.

Share this story CHICAGO — Long live the Big Ten West. In one of the more aesthetically displeasing games in Northwestern history a 52-yard field goal with 14 seconds left from Drew Stevens lifted Iowa (7-2 4-2 B1G) to a 10-7 victory over the Wildcats (4-5 2-4 B1G) at Wrigley Field. There wasn’t much offensive production from either team. Brendan Sullivan threw for 81 yards and a touchdown on 12-for-19 passing. Anthony Tyus II led the ‘Cats with 40 yards on 10 carries with Cam Porter contributing 36 yards on 12 rushes. Bryce Kirtz was the leading receiver with 33 yards on three catches. For Iowa Deacon Hill totaled 65 yards on 10-for-15 passing throwing a touchdown and an interception. Leshon Williams led the way on the ground with 24 carries for 79 yards. Defensively Xander Mueller accumulated 19 tackles in the losing effort while Jay Higgins racked up 12 tackles and a sack for Iowa. Starting at its own 24-yard line Iowa pounded it on the ground. Garnett Hollis Jr. and Xander Mueller held Leshon Williams for gains of four apiece on the game’s first two plays but Hollis then committed a pass interference penalty on a third-and-2. An eight-yard run from Williams and a sneak from Deacon Hill moved the chains again to put the Hawkeyes at midfield. NU forced yet another third-down thanks to some powerful run stuffs from Devin Turner but another pass interference call on Theran Johnson at the Wildcats’ 34-yard line extended the drive. However the ‘Cats stiffened up with a strip sack from Jaylen Pate forcing Iowa out of field goal range. Tory Taylor’s 27-yard punt set Northwestern up at its own 12. The Wildcats went nowhere. Nick Jackson punctuated a three-and-out with a sack of Brendan Sullivan. Cooper DeJean appeared to break free for a 45-yard punt return but a block in the back brought the Hawkeyes back to their own 37-yard line. Penalties continued to buoy Iowa with Hollis committing another pass interference penalty on an incompletion intended for Diante Vines. At the NU 34 though the Wildcats firmed up on defense again. Mueller blew up a third-and-9 screen to Williams for a loss of four which prompted Kirk Ferentz to trot out Drew Stevens for a 53-yard field goal attempt. It had the distance but clanged off the right goalpost to set Northwestern up at its own 36. Runs of eight and three from Cam Porter gave NU its first fresh set of downs on the afternoon. Just as the ‘Cats were working their way into Iowa territory though a miscommunication on the snap between Sullivan and center Ben Wrather almost led to disaster. The ball flew right past Sullivan who didn’t appear to anticipate the snap. Although Porter recovered it the mistake led to a loss of 17 and an ensuing punt that brought the first quarter to an end. Hill who completed his first five pass attempts found Addison Ostrenga and Vines for gains of six and eight respectively. A sideline interference penalty on Northwestern exacerbated the latter which placed Iowa at the NU 30. After a four-yard run by Vines Hill took an end zone shot intended for Nico Ragaini. However Johnson covered the route perfectly and rose up for an interception in the back right corner of the end zone. Sullivan quickly picked up a first down with a seven-yard scamper. Anthony Tyus III set up another third-and-short with two carries for eight yards but a false start on Josh Thompson moved the ‘Cats back. Although Cam Johnson created some separation on DeJean he couldn’t haul in a deep throw by Sullivan down the right sideline which brought up another punt. The last nine minutes of the first half were as uneventful as they could be. Both teams traded punts three times which brought the half to a close with the score still standing at 0-0. As Hill took a knee on the half’s final play he was met with a chorus of boos. It marked Northwestern’s first game in which it played in a 0-0 first half since its game against Michigan in 2014. The Wildcats accumulated just 29 total yards in the first half while surrendering almost double that number (51) on penalties. Both teams combined for a whopping 1.9 yards per play. Iowa found itself in Northwestern territory on 38% of its plays and couldn’t put up a single point. Clearly this game was on Peacock for a reason. The fun (or lack thereof) continued through the beginning of the third quarter when Iowa forced a three-and-out. The Hawkeyes made their first big play of the day on Renner’s ensuing punt as Anterio Thompson blocked it. That set up Hill and Co. at Northwestern’s 25-yard line. Remarkably Iowa capitalized. Thirty-six minutes into the contest Ostrenga scored the first points of the day with a two-yard touchdown reception off a play action pass from Hill. Stevens knocked the extra point through which gave Iowa a 7-0 lead with 9:04 left in the third quarter. The Wildcats responded with some offensive momentum. Sullivan found Johnson for an 11-yard gain and a pair of scrambles for eight yards each put Northwestern at around midfield. On a third-and-4 the QB and Johnson appeared to connect again for a diving five-yard reception but the officials later reversed the call and ruled that the ball touched the ground. On Iowa’s next possession Hill nearly threw a costly interception. Kenny Soares Jr. had him wrapped up but he tried to force an incompletion that bounced off Mueller’s hands. From there the drive stalled and Tory Taylor let his fifth punt of the day fly for 38 yards. A few plays later the third quarter came to a close with Iowa maintaining its 7-0 lead. NU again drove into Iowa territory with Tyus rushing for nine on a third-and-short to advance the ball to the Hawkeyes’ 39-yard line. It was Northwestern’s best field position of the day to that point. Tyus and Porter moved the chains again with back-to-back runs of eight and six yards. Even though a hold on Braeden Edwards moved the ‘Cats back to the Iowa 32 another 14-yard catch by Johnson set up a third-and-4. After two more runs from Tyus Northwestern found itself at the 13-yard line. Two plays later DeJean committed a pass interference penalty in the end zone on a throw intended for Bryce Kirtz. Northwestern had four downs to get two yards and even up the score. It failed. As chants of “Let’s Go Hawks” made the Friendly Confines seem anything but friendly Iowa stuffed a sneak from Sullivan two runs from Porter and another fourth-down sneak by Sullivan went nowhere. The Hawkeyes fans against the end zone roared after the goal-line stand and Iowa took over possession with 6:36 to play. Northwestern forced another three-and-out and A.J. Henning gave it life with a 23-yard return on a short punt which set it up at the Iowa 22. Following two short runs from Tyus Sullivan rolled out on a third-and-6 and found Kirtz to move the chains. No. 6 ran for seven yards but got wrapped up by DeJean for a loss of one on the next play. On a third-and-4 Sullivan found Johnson in the back of the end zone and fired a five-yard touchdown. Jack Olsen’s extra point was money and Northwestern tied the game at 7-7 with 1:46. Then Hill came alive. A throw to Ragaini for eight yards set Iowa in motion but a deep completion to Kaleb Brown for 23 yards — the longest play of the game — flipped the field. Iowa was now at the Northwestern 38. The Hawkeyes couldn’t move the ball much further which set up a 52-yard field goal attempt for Stevens. After missing one from 53 earlier Stevens’ kick split the uprights. Iowa had retaken the lead with 14 seconds to go. Despite an 18-yard catch by Kirtz the Wildcats ran out of time with Sullivan fumbling as the game concluded. Northwestern will head up to Camp Randall next Saturday to take on Wisconsin.

Will the Wildcats do something they haven’t since 2020 and beat the Hawkeyes? What about the dubious over/under? Our staffers weigh in. Iggy Dowling: Iowa 17 Northwestern 6 Northwestern hasn’t played two really good or really bad games in a row this entire season. It’s defied logic in every other way and it’ll do it this weekend at Wrigley Field by making this Iowa offense look somewhat passable. And yes take the under. Bradley Locker: Iowa 18 Northwestern 15 ""A real football score for what should be an incredibly amusing game. Northwestern has made legitimate strides on defense relative to permitting 33 to the Hawkeyes last year but the Cats will need to hem in Leshon Williams and Kaleb Johnson who combined for 24 carries and 136 yards in Iowa City in 2022. On offense I struggle to see Brendan Sullivan playing at as high of a clip particularly by staying in the pocket effectively. Plus Iowa can totally neutralize NUs receiver corps with Cooper DeJean and Sebastian Castro. This one should be somewhat close and yes even have both teams break 14 points!"" David Gold: Iowa 10 Northwestern 6 Take the under folks. Ethan Segall: Iowa 16 Northwestern 10 On one sideline stands Kirk Ferentz 25 years into his tenure as Iowa’s head coach. On the other (or same sideline but further down because Wrigley Field has a weird layout) is David Braun who will be coaching his ninth-ever game as head coach. Even in a newsy week that revealed Iowa’s offensive coordinator who is also Ferentz’s son will be getting the axe at the season’s end I’m favoring the veteran in what should be a doozy. Miguel Muñoz: Iowa 10 Northwestern 6  This game has the lowest over/under in college football history for a reason. On both sides of the ball Iowa will define this game — a terrific defense and a horrific offense. Northwestern just won’t be able to do much offensively.  Patrick Winograd: Iowa 16 Northwestern 13 I never thought I would see an over/under this low but now that it is actually happening I am still somehow siding with the under. I don’t think the announcement that Brian Ferentz will be out as Iowa’s offensive coordinator at the conclusion of the season will provide any kind of spark for the Hawkeyes but I do think they will have enough motivation to pull out an ugly victory. While I think both teams will be able to get the ball in the red zone due to some short fields and turnovers I also think both teams will struggle to cash in red zone opportunities leading to a classic low-scoring Big Ten West battle at Wrigley Field. Ascher Levin: Iowa 13 Northwestern 10 Coming off an offensive explosion against Maryland Northwestern is taking on one of the best defenses in the country led by cornerback Cooper DeJean. On the other side of the ball Iowa has the worst offense in the Big Ten and possibly the worst in the country. I think the game is going to be determined by special teams. Iowa has one of college football’s best punters of all time: Tory Taylor. Taylor is arguably the best and most important player on the team and he does a great job flipping the field. DeJean also is a punt returner and it will be necessary for Northwestern to keep the ball out of his hands. This game is going to be a low-scoring battle and I think Iowa will barely come out on top. Natalie Wells: Iowa 17 Northwestern 13 The Hawkeyes under OC Brian Ferentz have sported one of the country’s worst offenses this season averaging an FBS-worst 232.4 yards per game — football nepotism at its finest. Lucky for Iowa they have elite punter Tory Taylor who nets 45.5 yards per boot.

Share this story The age-old saying of “defense wins championships” proved true Sunday as Northwestern won the Big Ten Tournament Championship against Maryland to claim both the regular season and tournament titles.  It took 17 Northwestern and two Maryland corners before first-year Olivia Bent-Cole broke through to score in double overtime and clinch a 1-0 victory for the ‘Cats. Northwestern outshot Maryland 22-8 and spent considerably more time in front of the goal than Maryland did but the Terrapins’ defense held up until the very end. Maryland first-year goalie Alyssa Klebasko put on a clinic against the NU attack recording nine saves and halting what is one of the most lethal penalty corner units in the nation. Meanwhile Big Ten Goalie of the year and Northwestern senior Annabel Skubisz had five saves of her own. The scoreless first quarter was mostly a defensive battle as neither team saw much time in front of the goal. Northwestern drew a corner in less than two minutes but Maryland challenged the call to overturn the offensive opportunity. The ‘Cats outshot Maryland 5-1 but don’t be fooled: three of those five shots came within one offensive possession. Both goalies Skubisz and Klebasko made their mark early as Skubisz saved Maryland’s only shot while Klebasko got ahold of three from NU. In the second quarter things fared similarly for both teams. Northwestern drew two corners that resulted in caused turnovers from the Maryland defense while the ‘Cats blocked Maura Verleg ‘s shot on the Terps’ only corner. The Terrapins did outshoot the Wildcats 2-0 in this quarter but none came close to being a goal. Both Northwestern and Maryland came dangerously close to scoring in the third quarter but neither team availed. A shot from senior Lauren Wadas off a corner less than two minutes into the quarter had even passed Klebasko but Maryland’s Hope Rose stopped the shot at the goal line. Three minutes later Rose dribbled right up to the cage but Skubisz and the rest of the Wildcat defense immediately swarmed her. Northwestern had a prime opportunity in the third quarter after Rose received a yellow card and the ‘Cats drew two corners.  However shots from first-years Ilse Tromp and Bent-Cole were both saved by Klebasko. During the fourth quarter Northwestern constantly pressured the Maryland defense but none of that effort led to a goal. A Maryland foul early in the quarter awarded the Wildcats with yet another corner but Tromp’s shot went wide. Then fifth-year Peyton Halsey and Bent-Cole both made shots that barely missed the post with their slips helping force overtime as the game remained scoreless.  Bent-Cole sprinting down the field nearly won it for Northwestern four minutes into the first overtime but her shot was deflected by Klebasko. The Wildcats dominated possession and drew five consecutive penalty corners in overtime but once again couldn’t get past Klebasko and the Maryland defense as the game headed into double overtime. In double overtime Wadas hit a ball right into Rose on a corner. Due to the hit Rose who was a driving force for Maryland throughout the game left the game.  The magic happened seven minutes into double overtime as Bent-Cole finally got a ball behind Klebasko to give Northwestern the win. This marks Northwestern’s first Big Ten Tournament title since 2014 which also occurred against Maryland in Ann Arbor. On Sunday at 9 p.m. CT Northwestern will learn its seeding and matchup for the NCAA Tournament.    \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story When two football teams combine to score zero points in a half and 17 altogether you start to question some things. Will either team ever actually score? Where did the staples of the modern offense go? Why did I willingly choose to cover this matchup? What happened to the game I love? Those thoughts provided comedic relief during a slog of a game at Wrigley Field Saturday a contest featuring 339 total yards three non-garbage time plays of 10-plus yards and 14 punts. To the credit of both teams the second half became more exciting: the floodgates really opened with all sides finding the end zone including Northwestern doing so to tie the game with 1:50 left on a Brendan Sullivan touchdown pass to Cam Johnson. While the Wildcats roared back against one of the stingiest defenses in the nation that drive proved all for naught. On the ensuing possession Deacon Hill led the Hawkeyes on a seven-play 37-yard scamper to get Drew Stevens into field goal range; a 23-yard hole shot completion to Kaleb Brown was the dagger for the ‘Cats giving Iowa a legitimate chance to win. Kirk Ferentz’s side did just that escaping a hideous affair courtesy of a 52-yard bomb from his kicker. From a purple-and-white lens it can be easy to view Saturday’s affair as Northwestern falling victim to Iowa’s signature brand of play or simply giving plaudits to a kicker for stepping up. But those perspectives miss a larger point — that even though they battled the Wildcats still haven’t been able to materialize all the way through. Offense on either side was as hard to come by in this one as facing Cubs ace Justin Steele so it’s not like NU’s O was significantly worse than Iowa’s. Still Brian Ferentz’s unit outgained Mike Bajakian’s in offensive success rate (by 15% no less) and first downs. Considering that it was announced that Ferentz — notoriously one of the worst coordinators in college football — would not return at the end of the season it’s alarming to internalize that Bajakian’s actually group performed worse. There’s little question that Phil Parker’s defense stifles virtually any opponent and it did so countless times on Saturday. Yet altering the angle reflects continued offensive futility for the Wildcats. The possession that unquestionably stung the most for David Braun was an 18-play 66-yard drive that yielded zero points. After a fourth-and-1 conversion from Anthony Tyus III (which came on a toss — an interesting call when you need one yard) and Bryce Kirtz drawing pass interference on Cooper DeJean Northwestern had first-and-goal at the Iowa 2. Bajakian called four runs up the middle and the Hawkeyes responded every time hardly surrendering an inch and keeping NU off the board. Maybe it was the faulty turf down near home plate — which sparked several stoppages and was conspicuous from all the way up in the press box. Maybe it was an Iowa defense that’s cogent and stout. But the responsibility ultimately falls on the OC for not finding a way to punch the ball in. Frankly I didn’t despise trying to push the pile up the middle with Sullivan or another ball-carrier but working in a pass (e.g. play action) or some type of deception (a zone read) could have worked better. The blame for Northwestern’s frustrating loss doesn’t just fall on the shoulders of its offense though. NU’s defense had lapses throughout four quarters which gave Iowa prime opportunities to claim an advantage. Cornerbacks Garnett Hollis Jr. and Theran Johnson were flagged for PI three times in the opening quarter with all of such penalties giving the Hawkeyes a new set of downs on third down. Further Northwestern was assessed for sideline interference — which Braun explained was for making contact with an official — granting Iowa 15 more yards. It was another game with far too much laundry for the ‘Cats who posted seven penalties for 71 yards; meanwhile Iowa had just three calls for 30. Moreover Braun’s defense failed to make stops in some key situations. The Wildcats were continually victimized by Iowa’s PA Boot concept utilizing its tight ends including on Addison Ostrenga’s touchdown pass. As mentioned earlier the corner route to Brown against NU’s Cover Two effectively won Iowa the ballgame. Throughout nine games we’ve learned that Northwestern is a rather tenacious team that a) won’t give up and b) largely won’t get blown out against most opponents; both of those are unquestionably demarcations of improvement. However those traits won’t fully manifest themselves unless they translate into wins. Saturday proved especially painful for the Wildcats’ Big Ten West title hopes with Wisconsin and Indiana both falling to 5-4 and 3-3 in conference play. A win in the Friendly Confines would’ve not only put NU in that same standing but also would’ve erased Iowa’s slim lead. Now Northwestern has three games left in 2023 to qualify for a bowl game and to finalize the chapters of “writing its story” as Braun has consistently put it. At 4-5 where NU is would’ve been incomprehensible a mere two months ago and that shouldn’t be taken for granted. But in order to avoid having a promising season come to a premature end the Wildcats will need to begin putting together consecutive games of execution on both sides of the ball. That hasn’t happened so far this year and altogether for a program that hasn’t won two straight games since the midway point of the 2020 season. That win over Purdue in West Lafayette three years ago didn’t just spark the team’s last winning stretch: it also was NU’s last road win. At 14 games Northwestern possesses the longest losing streak on the road in the country. Will Braun’s troops demonstrate continued resolve and finally snap that in a pivotal showdown in Madison Wisconsin next weekend? Can the Wildcats collectivize their individual unit flashes and emerge victorious multiple Saturdays in a row departing the pendulum they’re on? Until those two facets become reality for Northwestern the team can’t transcend from unexpected Cinderella to intimidating division or conference contender — despite playing in Wrigley those are elements for which you can’t blame a curse or fan interference. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story “Some ledes just write themselves” says Jake Epstein who covers the ‘Cats for The Daily Northwestern. As we were standing at center circle on the Martin Stadium turf waiting to speak with Payne and Epstein couldn’t be more right. The scene unfolding in front of the Northwestern bench following a crushing 1-0 defeat to Michigan in the first round of the Big Ten Tournament said all that needs to be said. A drizzle which started at halftime continued to fall from the now pitch-black sky. Players were just standing around some looking completely disconsolate others with stunned expressions on their faces. There was no music blaring from a portable speaker and no one seemed to care about going through the appropriate cooldown routine. This atmosphere was a far cry from where it was just a half an hour ago. The bleachers which were nearly empty at kickoff had filled in nicely with purple. The crowd was demonstrating its own version of Isaac Newton’s Third Law of Motion meeting every positive action by a Wildcat with its own reaction of jubilant noise. While the ‘Cats were still deadlocked at 0-0 with the visiting Wolverines midway into the second period a sense they’d eventually find the back of the net surrounded the affair. That sense of inevitability wasn’t built on delusion. Northwestern indeed had been the better side in most if not all departments. It was outshooting Michigan pressing both relentlessly and effectively and keeping the ball in the Wolverines’ half. All it was truly lacking was the final product. And then in a matter of mere moments one Michigan attack out of nothing flipped the entire game on its head. In the 72nd minute a deflected shot from Wolverine RB Matthew Fisher fell right to the feet of striker Alex Waggoner who simply couldn’t miss from eight yards out. The visitors held a 1-0 lead and an NU goal went from being a formality to a necessity. Over the next 18 minutes of game time which likely lasted twice as long in real time due to various officiating-related reasons black shirts surged forward while Michigan sat deeper than ever — its shape was predominantly a 6-2-2. A couple of near misses and penalty shouts went by and for the second time in a week Northwestern was unable to breach the Michigan defense. For the second time in a week the Wildcats’ title aspirations were shattered by the boys from Ann Arbor. For the second time in a week NU suffered a defeat at the hands of the Wolverines when it probably shouldn’t have. Contentious refereeing decisions aside — and believe me there were quite a few — the final result was certainly was a bitter pill for the ‘Cats to swallow. To go from being predicted to finish eighth in the Big Ten to top of the conference standings after four games to then losing four of their last five with that run punctuated by this result and missing out on multiple trophies is an emotional roller-coaster theme park designers can only dream of creating. When Payne eventually made his way over to us we ask him questions and he responds at volume levels barely louder than a whisper. He emphasized how proud of he was of his team and in particular the seniors who stayed around and bought in when he started but ultimately his assessment of the game was straightforward. “We had some chances. We didn’t take ours. They got one and unfortunately that’s how our game goes sometimes” Payne says.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Before tonight’s tip-off against Binghamton our staff combined forces to predict Northwestern’s 2023-24 record and result and answer a few key questions about the ‘Cats. After an unforgettable season a year ago what do our writers predict for an encore? Regular season record: 19-12 (9-11 B1G) Big Ten finish: 8th Postseason result: NCAA Tournament appearance (No. 10 seed Round of 32) Everyone is sleeping on ____ and it drives me crazy: Ty Berry Game you’re most looking forward to that’s not Purdue: vs. Maryland (Jan. 17) One bold prediction: Northwestern gets swept by Nebraska Make no mistake about it this is a good team that brought back the bulk of its core. However I do think that the loss of Chase Audige will have a very significant impact on Northwestern’s defense especially early on as the team is figuring out its identity. The conference schedule is also very tough; NU plays No. 3 Purdue No. 4 Michigan State No. 25 Illinois and Maryland twice each. There’s a good shot that at least six losses come from those four teams alone. To make the Big Dance again the ‘Cats are going to have to shoot better than they did in 2022-23 and a reliable second option needs to consistently step up alongside Boo Buie. I think Ty Berry (somewhat) solves both of those problems. After shooting north of 36% from three-point land in each of his first two seasons he dipped down to 29% from deep in 2022-23. I’m guessing Berry will get all the way back but he’ll be in a great spot to thrive even if that clip only improves slightly. His terrific perimeter defense often got overshadowed by Audige’s and it’ll be more noticeable this year.  Ultimately this team goes as far as Buie goes. I think he’ll struggle early by his standards (and so will the ‘Cats) but he’ll play like an All-American late in the year. That’ll propel the team to a second-straight tournament berth and hot guards tend to lead teams that are March overachievers. Regular season record: 21-10 (11-9 B1G) Big Ten finish: 4th Postseason result: NCAA Tournament appearance (No. 7 seed Round of 32) Everyone is sleeping on __ and it drives me crazy: Nick Martinelli Game you’re most looking forward to that’s not Purdue: vs. Michigan State (Jan. 7) One bold prediction: Three Wildcats average 10+ points per game (first time in a full season since 2019-20) I truthfully think this Northwestern team is being underrated entering the 2023-24 season. The ‘Cats do depart two of their starting players but I think the team upgraded in a lot of key facets with the transfers it brought in. That’s reflected in my prediction: this offense should take some massive leaps and if the defense is at least solid having two three or even four players who can step up and get key buckets could prove enormous. Another reason why I’m bullish on NU is that a lot of other conference stalwarts have either gotten worse or not significantly better. Purdue Michigan State and Maryland seem like a clear-cut top three but Indiana/Wisconsin/Illinois are not totally moving me. It seems like it’s anyone’s chance after that first tier. I anticipate Brooks Barnhizer making the expected leap and then some earning an All-Big Ten Second Team nomination to go along with Boo Buie on the First Team. Even Ryan Langborg should become a quick fan favorite with his shooting playmaking and clutch play. Further I think this year’s bench has more depth than last year in Martinelli a healthy Luke Hunger and Justin Mullins. With another year of high-caliber play and postseason experience under its belt NU could make a deeper run in the NCAA Tournament but I wouldn’t bet on anything beyond the Round of 32. Regular season record: 21-10 (11-9 B1G) Big Ten finish: 3rd Postseason result: NCAA Tournament appearance (No. 7 seed Sweet 16) Everyone is sleeping on __ and it drives me crazy: Ryan Langborg Game you’re most looking forward to that’s not Purdue: at Indiana (Feb. 14) One bold prediction: Boo Buie will not be the leading scorer for the ‘Cats And. Here. We. Go. Northwestern basketball is back and I could not be more excited. I firmly believe that this version of the Wildcats is better than they were in 2022. NU has three if not four viable scoring options this season. It will not be on Boo Buie to carry the load each night because Brooks Barnhizer and Ryan Langborg can put up double digits each game. Losing Chase Audige is a massive blow defensively but Chris Lowery’s scheme does not require a superstar defender to succeed. Ty Berry was an excellent defender on the wings last season and Justin Mullins has the potential to be an elite defender and will improve throughout the season. Even if the ‘Cats’ defense falters at times NU’s ability to put up points should counteract any struggles on that end of the floor. At the end of the day I think Northwestern’s schedule is more difficult than last season’s so the Wildcats will drop one or two games more than it did; however there is no doubt in my mind that this is a tournament team. This may look real bad in March or I will see you on Selection Sunday. Regular season record: 20-11 (11-9 B1G) Big Ten finish: 7th Postseason result: NCAA Tournament appearance (No. 8 seed round of 32) Everyone is sleeping on ____ and it drives me crazy: Chris Collins Game you’re most looking forward to that’s not Purdue: vs. Iowa (Mar. 2) One bold prediction: Matthew Nicholson breaks the Northwestern record for single-season blocked shots I’m so excited for this season of Northwestern basketball. Last season was such a glorious surprise so it will be hard to match the pure joy of watching 2023’s magical run but I expect 2024 to be exciting in its own right. All three transfers (Ryan Langborg Justin Mullins and Blake Preston) are going to be crucial to the success of this team and will fill major roles right away. While I do have some concerns about the team’s ability to replace Chase Audige’s defense as well as a general lack of size I think Northwestern’s offense should actually improve from a season ago.  As far as my answers above go I’m expecting the Big Ten to be mighty competitive this season and it should be quite middle-heavy. Teams three through 10 could really be sorted in any order making each conference game crucial. The national media does not give Chris Collins the respect he deserves. The Athletic placed last year’s Big Ten Coach of the Year in Tier 5 in their 2023 coaching tiers a tier below Michigan’s Juwan Howard and a full two tiers lower than Penn State’s Mike Rhoades and Illinois’ Brad Underwood. Blasphemous. Collins’ work last season was as fine as any coach around the country and I expect that to carry over into 2024. Finally in regards to my bold prediction blocks technically did not become an official NCAA stat until 1986. So while I don’t expect Matt Nicholson to eclipse the estimated 123(!) blocks Jim Pitts tallied in 1966 I like his chances of passing Alex Olah’s mark of 59 from 2015. Last season Nicholson swatted 40 balls (the 10th greatest season in the category in Northwestern history) and with more minutes and experience a 20 block-boost seems feasible. Regular season record: 20-11 (11-9 B1G) Big Ten finish: 7th Postseason result: NCAA Tournament appearance (No. 8 seed Round of 32) Everyone is sleeping on ____ and it drives me crazy: Justin Mullins Game you’re most looking forward to that’s not Purdue: vs. Michigan State (Jan. 7) One bold prediction: Brooks Barnhizer makes an All-Big Ten Team I think Northwestern has a legitimate chance to be a better team in the 2023-2024 season than it was in 2022-2023. On paper this team faces a tougher conference schedule due to playing both No. 3 Purdue and No. 4 Michigan State twice. Stealing a victory at home over either (or both) of those two teams would drastically change the direction and national perception of this team. While I don’t predict that will happen I think the Wildcats are a team with enough experience and leadership that they will be able to beat middle-of-the-pack Big Ten teams and end the season in the top half of the conference. Northwestern will have to find ways to replace Chase Audige’s production on both ends but I think the ‘Cats have the right personnel to do just that. With Tydus Verhoeven moving on to play overseas Liberty transfer Blake Preston adds quality depth behind Matthew Nicholson and Justin Mullins adds a lot of versatility on the wing to help replace Audige. In my opinion Northwestern’s returning core will steady the ship for the ‘Cats while other teams struggle with a myriad of new faces on their respective rosters. The talent elsewhere in the conference might be at a higher level than Northwestern but the consistency and continuity for the Wildcats will lead this team to a second consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance. Regular season record: 19-12 (10-10 B1G) Big Ten finish: 7th Postseason result: NCAA Tournament appearance (No. 9 seed Round of 32) Everyone is sleeping on ____ and it drives me crazy: Justin Mullins Game you’re most looking forward to that’s not Purdue: vs Illinois (Jan. 24) One bold prediction: Northwestern leads the B1G in threes attempted per game The race back to the Big Dance starts Monday for a new-look ‘Cats team primed to be in the middle of the excitement of conference play. After finishing with a program-record 12 conference wins and their best conference finish since 1959 it’s highly improbable we see the same magnitude of success for Northwestern in 2023-24.  However this team is more than good enough offensively with four incredibly capable scorers in Buie Barnhizer Berry and Langborg and a tight defensive unit held together by defensive guru Chris Lowery. Success in non-conference play is critical especially since Northwestern only faces two non-conference Power-5 teams making every game before the start of conference play— especially against those Power-5 teams and Dayton on Nov. 10 — paramount for the strength of Northwestern’s resume before Big Ten play. Buie and Barnhizer are certified buckets and if Berry and Langborg can find their strokes from deep Northwestern will be a better offense than they were a year ago. But without Chase Audige it remains to be seen if the ‘Cats can hold up defensively. If Northwestern grabs big wins over programs like Maryland Illinois Michigan State or Purdue and don’t drop silly ones to teams like Penn State or Minnesota they should make it back to March for the first time in consecutive seasons. However with nothing guaranteed in the Big Ten Chris Collins and company need to hit the ground running to maximize their chances of a trip back to the tournament. Regular season record: 20-11 (11-9 B1G) Big Ten finish: 7th Postseason result: NCAA Tournament appearance (No. 8 seed Round of 32) Everyone is sleeping on ____ and it drives me crazy: Matthew Nicholson Game you’re most looking forward to that’s not Purdue: vs Illinois (Jan. 24) One bold prediction: Boo Buie doesn’t lead the team in scoring The Wildcats look to return to the NCAA Tournament for the third time in program history and make a consecutive appearance in the Big Dance for the first time in school history. Though many of its key pieces still remain intact — three of its four top scorers from the year before are returning — key players like Chase Audige and Robbie Beran parted ways after a terrific 2022-23 season.  The focal point for this team is of course Boo Buie. The fifth-year senior guard was extraordinary for the Wildcats last year leading the team in points assists and minutes. But if Northwestern hopes to replicate their success from the season before though other players will have to step up. Luckily for head coach Chris Collins and company they have a plethora of talent waiting in the wings. Among the most exciting prospects are two young guards: Brooks Barnhizer and Justin Mullins. Barnhizer established himself as a serious threat last year including five games of 15 or more points. Similarly Denver transfer Justin Mullins could be a major addition to the ‘Cats with his prolific shooting which is desperately needed for a team that finished 14th and 12th in field goal and 3-point shooting respectively. Now the focal point of the Wildcat frontcourt senior big man Matthew Nicholson is set to be a major part of the team on both sides of the court. After showing sparks of dominance including a 17-point effort in a season-ending loss to UCLA Nicholson’s role is bound to be more pronounced this coming year. With Beran gone the 7-footer is going to need to be productive to avoid a major hole in the NU frontcourt especially in a conference filled with talented bigs.   Brendan Preisman Regular Season Record: 20-11 (11-9 B1G) Big Ten Finish: 7th Postseason Result: NCAA Tournament appearance (No. 8 seed Sweet 16) Everyone is sleeping on ____ and it drives me crazy: Ryan Langborg Game you’re most looking forward to that’s not Purdue: at Wisconsin (Jan. 13) One bold prediction: Northwestern doesn’t beat a single top 25 team... Until the round of 32 Let’s get spicy with it. Unlike last year I don’t think Northwestern gets a big regular season win like last year’s program-shifting upset of Purdue. Michigan State is a genuine threat for the national title and the Boilermakers have every reason to play with revenge on their minds after the way last year went. The only other current top 25 team in the conference is Illinois and for some reason (namely a tendency to drop winnable games against roughly equal teams) I feel like Northwestern will struggle with them as well.  ""However one thing the Wildcats won’t struggle with is beating the teams they’re supposed to. Assuming they get past Dayton the ‘Cats should be 5-0 when they play Purdue on December 1 and after that they don’t play a genuine threat until January 2 (the first matchup against Illinois). There’s a real chance the squad is 10-1 heading into 2024 and the returners will be a main reason why. Brooks Barnhizer took just 6.4 shots per game last year and didnt start at all. Both of those things should trend way up and if the exhibition game is any indication he might be this team’s second-best player. Matt Nicholson is also going to be key and I think he’s due for a leap as well."" Northwestern’s hot start isn’t going to guarantee them another bid to the Big Dance but a strong showing in the Big Ten Tournament will. I expect the Wildcats to win multiple games in their first bout of postseason play and Langborg will be the reason why. He upped his scoring by over three points per game in postseason play last year and made 12 three-pointers in five postseason contests. You need hot shooting to succeed in postseason basketball and Langborg provides that. I also think he’ll be the spark for Northwestern’s stunning upset of a 1-seed in the Round of 32...perhaps a certain team from West Lafayette. Am I drinking the Kool-Aid? Maybe. But this team’s experience and talent lend themselves well to postseason action.  Ascher Levin Regular season record: 22-9 (12-8 B1G) Big Ten finish: 4th Postseason result: NCAA Tournament appearance (No. 7 seed Sweet 16) Everyone is sleeping on ____ and it drives me crazy: Matthew Nicholson Game you’re most looking forward to that’s not Purdue: vs. Michigan State (Jan. 7) One bold prediction: Northwestern beats a top-five team this year The ‘Cats have a good chance to make the NCAA Tournament and continue their success from last year. Losing Chase Audige hurts but Northwestern has become a deeper team with the additions of Ryan Langborg Justin Mullins and Blake Preston. First-year Jordan Clayton also has a great opportunity to contribute as a backup point guard.  After watching Brooks Barnhizer in Northwestern’s exhibition game last week it looks like he has taken on a strong leadership role as a captain. The ‘Cats will look for that kind of improvement and if he plays with the assertiveness that he did last week Northwestern will have a potent one-two punch.  Matthew Nicholson showed remarkable improvement last year and I am counting on him to continue being a great rim runner and shot blocker. I am also predicting that Northwestern beats a top-five team and that will mean taking down either Purdue or Michigan State assuming either team is still in the top five when the Wildcats play them. While I have high expectations the team has to have a great non-conference start to the year and continue that into conference play. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

At this point you can look at a game imagine the most unlikely outcome and chances are it will come true. It’s almost as if every game is determined by a random outcome generator. At the very least that has to be the case when Big Ten West teams are involved. How else do you explain the results of this past weekend? You’ll see what I mean in a second but for now welcome to another edition of Around the Big Ten. Big Ten East frontrunners… win setting up a heavyweight fight next week Like clockwork the top contenders for the Big Ten East title won the games they were supposed to win albeit some in more impressive fashion than others. Ohio State started Saturday off with a 35-16 win over Rutgers overcoming a 9-7 halftime deficit in doing so. Penn State followed with a 51-15 thrashing of Maryland scoring 27 points in the fourth quarter to win going away. Michigan was the last of the trio to take the field Saturday with a game under the lights at the Big House. The Wolverines eased past Purdue 41-13 behind three Blake Corum touchdowns. The wins by each of the Big Three set us up for Round Two of the Big Ten heavyweight battle this upcoming weekend when No. 3 Michigan travels to Happy Valley to take on No. 11 Penn State. According to ESPN Analytics Penn State is the slight favorite as the model gives them a 51% chance of winning. According to Vegas Michigan is the favorite being favored by 3.5. Although the line has gone down dramatically since it opened at MICH -6.5. The game will feature the top two scoring offenses in the Big Ten the top two defenses in terms of yards per game in the conference and two of the best quarterbacks in the conference in Michigan’s J.J. McCarthy and Penn State’s Drew Allar. The big-time bout will take place this upcoming Saturday at Noon EST and will go a long way in determining how the Big Ten East race plays out. Big Ten West frontrunners… lose leaving Iowa out in front Like clockwork the top contenders for the Big Ten West crown (save for Iowa) lost the games they were supposed to win all of which came in equally embarrassing fashion. Wisconsin got things started with a 20-14 loss to Indiana who came into the game winless in Big Ten play. Nebraska followed that performance up with an instant classic of their own losing 20-17 to Michigan State. Michigan State like Indiana came into the game winless in the Big Ten. Minnesota completed the trifecta with a 27-26 home loss to Illinois after allowing the Fighting Illini to score a last-minute go-ahead touchdown on a 46-yard touchdown pass by Illinois backup quarterback John Paddock. Before getting into the Big Ten West ramifications produced by these outcomes kudos first need to go out to the winning sides. The Hoosiers and Spartans got a huge monkey off their backs with not only their first Big Ten wins of the season but also their first wins against FBS opponents in 2023. For the Fighting Illini their miraculous win leaves them in a good position to reach a bowl game something not many saw happening after their loss to Nebraska one month ago. For those that lost their individual heartbreaks broke a four-way-tie atop the division leaving Iowa alone in first place after the Hawkeyes 10-7 win over Northwestern (more on that later). With three games to go for each team it once again puts the Hawkeyes in the driver seat to claim the division as according to ESPN Analytics they are favored in each of their remaining games. Then again the Big Ten West is the equivalent of the Upside Down so proceed with caution. Game of the… 19th century  Speaking of Iowa-Northwestern leave it to the historic Wrigley Field to be the site of a game that sets the sport back two centuries. The game between the Hawkeyes and Wildcats featured quite possibly the hardest-to-watch offensive performance of any game I have watched this season and the numbers back it up. There were just 17 points scored and only 339 total yards between the two teams. Naturally the game was won on a 53-yard field goal by Iowa kicker Drew Stevens with 14 seconds remaining concluding the longest scoring drive of the game totaling 37 yards.  The biggest series of the game however was when Northwestern drove the ball down to the Iowa two-yard line with the Hawkeyes leading 7-0 late in the fourth quarter. The Wildcats ran the ball four times with two of those attempts being the “tush push.” They failed to score any points on the drive ending inside the one-yard line and went on to lose by three. Speaking of three each of the last three Hawkeyes’ games have resulted in 22 points or less between themselves and their opponents. Iowa plays Rutgers next weekend and there’s a solid chance that streak extends to four.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story I hate to start an article with a less than inspiring flashback but recall Northwestern’s men’s tennis team’s success in the NCAA tournament. What comes to mind? At best you likely summoned a traumatic flashback to a nail-biting loss to No. 4 Kentucky in the Round of 32 — a memory of what almost was. At worst you remembered the five prior Round of 32 matches all of which were also lost.  The ‘Cats have a historically difficult time advancing past the second round of the spring tourney. Many of those previous runs included a permutation of now-alums Steve Forman Ivan Yatsuk Simen Bratholm and Trice Pickens. I opined last season that the graduation of that quartet would be detrimental to the program seeing as though those guys often occupied the top four courts on match day. But now having had months to reflect and enjoying the benefit of analyzing some of the team’s first-years in recent outings I’m optimistic. Yes Forman and co. were essential in delivering NU one of its best season’s in recent history but there’s value in postseason success too. Maybe fresh blood can build on the recent progress right? After a solid showing from Jackson Caldwell the lone freshman to make a splash at ITA Midwest Regionals the young bunch got a more cohesive shot at match time this weekend as NU wraps up a brief fall season. Up in Madison Wisconsin the ‘Cats embarked on an early litmus test at the fall iteration of Big Ten Championships: how would the young additions be able to impact the team if at all in early year competition against conference opponents?  The answer is generally an encouraging one. Before I go further rest assured that the following results are separate from the ones in spring season which play a more substantial role in tourney seeding and the like. The Big Ten Championships are formatted for singles and doubles play. With 44 players from most schools in attendance the intended 64-singles/32-doubles bracket offered some byes. Up first was doubles play on Thursday. Northwestern submitted four duos: a pair of freshmen in Nick Herdoiza and Owen Megargee a freshman-senior combo in Caldwell and Saiprakash Goli a set of veterans in Felix Nordby and Gleb Blekher and a young pairing in Greyson Casey and Chad Miller. Between the Herdoiza-Megargee and Cladwell-Goli pairs only one got it done in the first Round of 32. The former lost 6-3 to a team from Wisconsin while the latter avenged their teammates with a 6-4 win of their own against a different Wisconsin double.  Thanks to so many vacancies in the tournament schedule Herdoiza-Megargee got a second chance in a different draw within the bracket and made strides in their next attempt. Every doubles team advanced past the Round of 16 (Nordby-Blekher and Casey-Miller had byes in the Round of 32) hopefully foreshadowing what’s to come at NCAAs in the spring where moving on to the third layer of a tournament has proven challenging for the program.  The seasoned combo of Nordby-Blekher fell in the quarterfinals as did Casey-Miller. Excitingly it was largely freshmen that pushed on to the semis as the exclusively first-year duo of Herdoiza and Megargee won their bout to push on to the finals while Goli and Caldwell got squashed by a set of Michigan rackets. In the less competitive West draw Herdoiza and Megargee stunned a Wisconsin duo in the finals to claim the title. Talk about that for reloading in the offseason. To save your time I won’t list every singles outcome like I just did so painstakingly for the doubles category. In the opening set of matches NU’s players combined to go 7-5 with almost every ‘Cat advancing in one draw region or another. The real winners in that department were Blekher a senior and Nordby a junior both of whom made it to the semifinals in the Northeast draw. Nordby advanced to the finals but the match went unplayed. Caldwell also zoomed through into a finals win. In all it was an impressive showing from a group of young rackets. Having rounded out the fall campaign it’s looking like head coach Arvid Swan has done another good job at reshelving the team’s roster with talent. Even better than the transfer portal which Swan has relied on in the past his new group of playmakers are organic freshmen. Hopefully they’re here for a while. Now that NU has concluded its autumnal preview it’ll go dormant for a few months — until matches start to affect records. Mark your calendars for Jan. 15 when the ‘Cats will face off against NC State to kick off the 2024 season. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Sure we may be in the thick of football season. The NBA in-season tournament is underway. And yeah the Texas Rangers just won their first ever World Series title. But who cares about any of that? College basketball is officially back! All jokes aside it’s an exciting time to be a fan of any sport but in particular college hoops. With Boo Buie and co. recently dominating in their exhibition match against McKendree Northwestern fans are eager to watch the Wildcats run it back this year after a historic season that culminated in a trip to the second round of March Madness. Although NU fans have a lot to be excited about so do most teams in the Big Ten. Zach Edey the 2023 Big Ten Player of the Year is back for another season at Purdue while Michigan State boasts a recruiting class headlined by five-star Xavier Booker. In its final season before the introduction of four west-coast teams the Big Ten seeks to prove to the rest of the world that it can pull through when it matters. Last year despite sending eight teams to March Madness only Michigan State escaped the second round just to lose in the Sweet 16. In fact it’s now been over two decades since the Spartans won the national title with Tom Izzo. Most current Northwestern students weren’t even born yet! Despite recent failures many Big Ten teams are optimistic that this is the year that they will finally shock the world. While that claim has more validity for some teams than others it will surely be a fun season for all fans. Here are this year’s Preseason B1G Men’s Basketball Power Rankings:  1. Purdue Boilermakers The Boilermakers are sitting pretty at the top of the Big Ten for another year with big man Zach Edey opting to return for his fourth season. The consensus first-team All-American is certainly the headliner for Purdue but he’s far from the only guy making Purdue such a formidable opponent. Sophomores Braden Smith and Fletcher Loyer look to build off their impressive first years while senior Mason Gillis aims to leave it all on the court in what could potentially be his final season with the program.  The Boilermakers should have no problem cruising through the regular season and earning a high seed in March Madness. The real question is whether they can overcome their historic postseason struggles — most notoriously last year’s painful loss to 16-seed Fairleigh-Dickinson. If Purdue can get out of its own way when it truly matters there’s no reason why they can’t cut down the ropes come March. 2. Michigan State Spartans While Purdue is the clear-cut favorite to win the Big Ten this year Michigan State is not far behind. Returning four of five starters (including AJ Hoggard Jaden Akins and Tyson Walker) from last year’s Sweet 16 run under eventual Hall-of-Fame coach Tom Izzo is not a shabby start. Add on to that a freshman recruiting class featuring three top-50 prospects and the Spartans are looking outright dangerous.  Xavier Booker the five-star center from Indianapolis should look to make an immediate impact while four-star point guard Jeremy Fears could also play a pivotal role as a backup guard under the mentorship of Hoggard and Walker. Last year the Spartans were good but very streaky in their play. This year they look poised to be great but that will only happen if they can overcome the inconsistencies that plagued them last year. 3. Illinois Fighting Illini Illinois is destined for big things this season after Terrence Shannon Jr. and Coleman Hawkins both announced their returns. Shannon Jr. who made the First Team All Big Ten in 2023 is unquestionably one of the best players in the conference averaging 17.2 points per game last season. Hawkins meanwhile will be a force to be reckoned with on the defensive side of the ball.  In addition Illinois brought in a decent transfer and freshman class headlined by former Oregon forward Quincy Guerrier and freshman Amani Hansberry. Sophomore Ty Rodgers also looks to make a big leap forward in a possible starting role after a lackluster first season with the Illini. Illinois clearly has the talent necessary to cause a major disturbance in March. The question is will they mesh well? 4. Maryland Terrapins ""Kevin Willard’s first season as Marylands head coach exceeded expectations. His squad went 22-13 earned a bid to March Madness and advanced to the second round before getting bounced by Alabama. This year Willard looks to build on that successful first season and all signs are pointing to him being able to do just that. "" Jahmir Young the All-Big Ten point guard from last season will be back along with Julian Reese one of the best big men in the conference. Maryland also landed guard Deshawn Harris-Smith one of the top-30 freshmen recruits and Indiana transfer Jordan Geronimo could play a significant role if he can avoid the injury bug. Retention of their key players plus some solid acquisitions puts Maryland in a great spot to run it back under Willard after an exciting 2022-2023. 5. Northwestern Wildcats Could I be overhyping Northwestern just a little bit? Maybe. However the Wildcats are certainly capable of repeating their successes from last year which included a trip to the second round of March Madness almost culminating in a win over UCLA. With Boo Buie returning for one last dance Northwestern gets back its leading scorer and one of the best guards in the Big Ten. Getting big man Matthew Nicholson back is equally as important while Ty Berry and Brooks Barnhizer also look to be key contributors. The Wildcats also hauled in a good transfer class that includes Princeton’s Ryan Langborg and Liberty’s Blake Preston.  Losing Chase Audige will undoubtedly hurt the Wildcats and his impact on defense will be challenging to replace. However if Northwestern can mimic his production with the guys they have now they look poised to match or even eclipse the level of success they enjoyed last year. 6. Indiana Hoosiers Indiana was handed two tough blows when Trayce Jackson-Davis and Jalen Hood-Schifino both declared for the NBA draft. However the Hoosiers are still in a position to win big and make a tournament run. Getting Xavier Johnson back from injury is huge and five-star freshman Mackenzie Mgbako checks out to be a huge problem for opponents. Between those players and Oregon big man transfer Kel’el Ware Indiana’s defense should be one of the most lockdown units in college basketball. The offense could suffer a bit without two of its key contributors from last year. However even if Indiana regresses slightly they should still be a team to watch come March. 7. Wisconsin Badgers After a strong start last year that included winning its first three conference games everything went downhill for Wisconsin. The Badgers finished 20-15 and won three games in the NIT but at the end of the day the goal was March Madness and they failed at that. Fortunately they are in a good position to reach that goal this year. Wisconsin returns all five of its starters from last season meaning it can hit the ground running. However the starters will simply need to play better than they did last year.  Tyler Wahl and Chucky Hepburn put up underwhelming numbers which was a critical reason that the Badgers failed to live up to expectations. Any chance of a Wisconsin bounce-back season hinges on the two of them returning to form. 8. Ohio State Buckeyes Ohio State was a weird team last year. They finished the regular season 16-19 including a 5-15 record against Big Ten opponents. Yet largely under the leadership and talent of Brice Sensabaugh the Buckeyes defeated Wisconsin Iowa and Michigan State during the Big Ten tournament before falling to Purdue in the semifinals. Ohio State is without Sensabaugh this season so all signs point to further regression. Or do they?  Boasting one of the youngest rosters in college basketball Ohio State has the potential to break into the conversation with some of the upper-tier B1G teams. Forward Zed Key center Felix Okpara and guard Roddy Gayle Jr. will spearhead the Buckeyes’ redemption tour in their sophomore campaigns. If they can build off their first years and overcome the growing pains from last season Ohio State could be a dark horse team to watch. 9. Iowa Hawkeyes Defense has never been Iowa’s strong suit. The Hawkeyes had an abysmal defensive efficiency last year and the forecast is not looking bright for this season. Where Iowa has always thrived has been its offense. More specifically it has always seemed to have one powerhouse scorer to lead the way. First it was Luka Garza. Then came Keegan Murray and then his twin brother Kris. This year there’s not one clear-cut man Iowa can rely on to consistently score 20 points.  Fortunately the Hawkeyes have a few guys who could combine to give them the offensive spark they need to compete for a tournament bid. Veteran Peyton Sandfort is one of the more accurate shooters in the sport while Tony Perkins has big-game potential akin to Garza and the Murray twins. Additionally Valparaiso transfer Ben Krikke looks to contribute to the offensive effort with his reliable jumper. Iowa has the offensive pieces necessary to win games. If they falter however Hawkeye fans are in for a brutal few months. 10. Rutgers Scarlet Knights Losing Caleb McConnell is a tough blow for Rutgers whose defense flourished under his leadership. However with big man Cliff Omoruyi and forward Mawot Mag both returning for another year the defense should not regress too much. Last season Omoruyi nearly averaged 10 rebounds each night to complement his 2.1 blocks per game. Meanwhile Mag averaged 5.3 rebounds and a steal per game. The duo was crucial to the Scarlet Knights’ defensive prowess last year and they look to build on that success this season.  The offense does not look to put up scary numbers but it can certainly be efficient enough to help Rutgers exceed expectations. Guard Derek Simpson is a potential breakout candidate for the team while transfer guard Noah Fernandes put up 13 points per game last season for UMass. There are definitely some injury concerns for Rutgers and it remains to be seen how its squad will gel together. However if the offense can play at an above-average level the elite defense is more than enough to make Rutgers a team to watch come March. 11. Michigan Wolverines Michigan had a tough offseason. In fact tough may be understating just how awful it was for the Wolverines. Losing freshman starters Jett Howard and Kobe Bufkin hurt but that was to be expected. The devastating blow for Michigan was when Hunter Dickinson the Wolverines’ starting center of three years decided to put his name in the transfer portal ultimately landing with Kansas. Michigan almost had a solid addition in UNC guard Caleb Love but due to an admissions issue involving the transfer of credits Love was forced to back out ending up with Arizona instead.  However despite the drama-filled offseason there is still a path to success for the Wolverines. They will just need everybody to be fantastic. Sophomore guard Dug McDaniel and forward Olivier Nkamhoua who Michigan acquired in the transfer portal from Tennessee will need to be at the top of their games in order to lead the Wolverines’ young roster back to March Madness. Otherwise things could get really ugly really quickly. 12. Nebraska Cornhuskers Despite the low placement on these rankings the Cornhuskers aren’t necessarily a bad team. The Big Ten is simply a loaded conference and somebody has to be towards the bottom. That being said it’s very possible that Nebraska outperforms expectations and puts up a respectable season. This season they will be led by guard Keisei Tominaga who put up monster numbers to end last year’s campaign.  Unfortunately much of his help left in the offseason so he’ll have to rely on a new crop of guys to help him and Nebraska shock the world. Bradley transfer Rienk Mast and Charlotte transfer Brice Williams look to round out Nebraska’s big three for the year. The trio has major potential but things could trend downward if they lack chemistry so Nebraska fans better hope they mesh well. 13. Penn State Nittany Lions Penn State suffered a massive blow this offseason when head coach Micah Shrewsberry departed the program for Notre Dame. However they found a solid replacement in Mike Rhoades from VCU. Rhoades was adept at developing defenses at VCU and Penn State’s defensive unit should look good under his supervision.  Perhaps the biggest perk that comes with hiring Rhoades though is that coming with him from VCU is point guard Ace Baldwin. Last year’s A-10 Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year will immediately assume a leadership role on the team and a player like him is capable of carrying a team to new heights. Unfortunately the rest of Penn State’s roster lacks depth and despite having a guy like Baldwin it is likely that Rhoades’s first year with the program will be a rebuilding campaign. 14. Minnesota Golden Gophers Minnesota finished at the very bottom of the Big Ten last season going 9-22 overall and an abysmal 2-17 against in-conference opponents. The Gophers did go out and make some additions in the offseason such as Howard’s Elijah Hawkins and Pepperdine’s Mike Mitchell Jr. They also have a possible breakout candidate in forward Dawson Garcia who averaged over 15 points per game last season. However it is unlikely that any of these players will move the needle for Minnesota especially given the vast amount of talent across the conference. Barring a crazy miracle expect Minnesota to remain among the bottom-feeders of the Big Ten this year. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Funnily enough the most surprising Northwestern field hockey news that came out of Sunday was not that it won the Big Ten Tournament title but that it was named the No. 2 seed heading into the upcoming NCAA Tournament.  Yes you heard that right. The team that is on an 18-game win streak spanning two months and has been the No. 1 team in the country since Oct. 10 is not the top seed in the NCAA tournament. That title belongs to North Carolina the ACC regular season and tournament champions. While UNC has a worse record (14-3) compared to Northwestern (18-1) it does have a higher RPI (which ranks a team based on both win-loss record and strength of schedule) which likely explains why it took the No. 1 seed position.  ""And while its tempting to lament over the choices of the NCAA selection committee this seeding might not be a bad thing. In fact it adds fuel to a narrative that might just be the perfect bulletin board material for the Wildcats headed into the Big Dance."" It might seem like Northwestern is having a flawless season but its recent performances during the Big Ten Tournament proved that the team had its vulnerabilities. During the semifinals against Ohio State the Wildcats were outshot 7-3 by the Buckeyes in the first half (thank goodness for Annabel Skubisz) and only won off a third-quarter three-goal explosion. Then came the nail-biter of a championship game versus Maryland where the Terrapin defense made Northwestern’s life very difficult until first-year Olivia Bent-Cole busted open the gates to score in double overtime. A win is a win but that also applies to other teams—one or two extra mistakes and NU could have come out of the Big Ten Tournament empty-handed. The Wildcats’ struggles albeit their wins as well as their No. 2 seeding in the NCAA tournament show that they still have so much to fight for despite all the work they’ve already done. As head coach Tracey Fuchs said when Northwestern beat Maryland in the regular season each portion of the team’s season is the beginning of a new season. High seedings and past successes might bring momentum but ultimately they don’t determine future results. However it’s not necessarily bad that Northwestern is still trying to prove something at this point in the season. We’ve seen many times how highly-touted teams can crumble at the most unexpected moments (may I bring up Purdue men’s basketball?) so it doesn’t hurt to still have more to chase.  And the aforementioned is important for the Wildcats who won’t have the easiest path to the Final Four in their Evanston regional. On Friday they will face the winner of Wednesday’s matchup between Miami of Ohio and California having never faced either team during the regular season. If they win that second-round matchup they will play either No. 7 Iowa or No. 10 Louisville on Nov. 12 for a trip to the Final Four. Notably Louisville is the only team this season to have beaten Northwestern defeating the Cats 1-0 in their season opener. And although NU beat Iowa 2-0 the Hawkeyes are still a strong team that at one point was ranked No. 1 in the season (though they did lose three of their last four games). If Northwestern makes it to the Final Four they might face UNC in the national championship game where a picture-perfect revenge arc could be shaped. Not only are the Tar Heels the team that got the No. 1 seed over the Wildcats but they are also coached by former UNC player Erin Matson who scored the game-winning goal against NU in last year’s national championship game.  Northwestern might have already checked off several boxes in its successful season but the season is not over yet with the grand prize still on the line. And the Big Ten Tournament and that No. 2 seeding might just be the perfect reminder of that.

In under an hour the Wildcats would do battle with the UCLA Bruins in the Round of 32 from the Golden 1 Center in Sacramento California. If those arriving from Evanston wanted serenity and quietude in advance of their marquee showdown they got anything but that. The teams that were occupying the Downtown Commons’ court in the matchup prior to Wildcats-Bruins were No. 15-seed Princeton and No. 7-seed Missouri. Before purple paraphernalia could line the arena’s seats a flock of orange had to leave first — and there was plenty of euphoria to go around. Indeed the Ivy League’s Tigers fresh off a historic upset of No. 2-seed Arizona had just beaten the SEC’s Tigers 78-63 to reach the Sweet 16. Paving the way to Princeton’s dream-like run was senior guard Ryan Langborg who poured in 22 points six rebounds and four assists to lead all scorers. As the Tigers returned to their locker room on Cloud Nine the Wildcats began to depart for their own ensuing Round of 32 game. But as he’s now learned the noise from next door was impossible to ignore. “We were screaming and yelling the whole time” Langborg said with a laugh. “Apparently they could hear us in the locker room next to them.” Although NU’s season came to a heartbreaking end with a narrow 68-63 defeat to UCLA that night that encounter with their Ivy League arena mates — two schools with similar creeds and deep-seated connections seeing one another in the tunnel — would prove portentous in the next few months. Only three days after the clock reached midnight on Princeton’s Cinderella run Langborg entered the transfer portal as a graduate student; Ivy League sports do not allow fifth-year competitors and Langborg didn’t want to hang up his shoes just yet. A month later he decided on his new home: Northwestern. “For me it was actually the guys” Langborg said of why he picked NU. “I was on my visit; connected with the guys. They reminded me a lot of the Princeton guys. Love the way they play. Love the coaches. It was a great fit.” Maybe it’s a coincidence that Langborg’s initial and new programs shared spaces out west in March Madness. But what also tethers Northwestern and Princeton is Mitch Henderson the Tigers’ head coach who spent 2000-11 as an assistant with the ‘Cats. Henderson referred to his time in Evanston as “11 happy years.” “My ties are to those kinds of people” Henderson said. “You’re always working really hard there. Really happy to see their success.” During the entire 2022-23 season Langborg flourished out in New Jersey. His 12.7 points per game ranked second on the Tigers including converting 33.2% of three-pointers and 82.3% of shots from the free throw line. However where Langborg transformed from a well-kept scoring secret to a national star was on the magnified March stage. On the heels of his spectacular showing against Mizzou the Californian refined his play once more in the Sweet 16. Against No. 6-seed Creighton Langborg dazzled with 26 points — on an efficient 11-of-17 shooting no less — three rebounds one assist and two steals. Despite the fact that the Tigers lost 86-75 their odds-defying streak coming to a halt it was the highest-scoring output of his career in black and orange. “I can always play with the best of competition — that my play will elevate when I play against better competition” Langborg said about his March box scores. “I’m hoping to take another leap forward this year and continue playing at that level and be more consistent at that level.” In the eyes of his former head coach Langborg’s unforgettable performances reflect his day-to-day traits rather than a simple point total. “It’s always there in Ryan” Henderson said. “In those games he set some incredible screens; made some gigantic hustle plays for steals. He’s just a winner.” After culminating four years of work in just three games of March Madness it could be easy to consistently relish in that spotlight to harken back to a once-in-a-lifetime run catalyzed by individual acumen. Langborg isn’t forgetting about that stretch anytime soon but he’s also keeping perspective. “We still talk about it with my buddies all the time. We watched the games over a few times” Langborg said. “But now on to a new chapter. Take the lessons that we learned from that.” When Princeton guard Blake Peters first met Langborg at a scrimmage in a local New Jersey YMCA the junior picked up on Langborg’s “West Coast vibe.” After all the 6-foot-4 guard hails from San Diego California. But what was also evident to Peters was the veteran’s attention to detail in his craft. “Very intense. Very focused” Peters said. “Doesn’t say much. That’s just because he’s very focused and all about his business.” Despite having an edge in terms of his approach Langborg didn’t lose the desire to help his teammates improve their own abilities. Peters referred to Langborg as a “consummate leader” with the two going head-to-head in shooting drills under Tigers assistant coach Skye Ettin. “It was always first to five makes first to 10 makes. Ryan was always very competitive even in non-game settings — he always wanted to win” Peters recalled. “I think that just kind of speaks to his character how he plays on the court.” That fire was especially noticeable during one particular practice at Princeton. With Peters and Langborg on different teams the former nailed a shot and talked some smack — but Langborg wasn’t having it even throwing a punch to Peters in the arm. “I was like ‘Oh geez. I guess I crossed the line with Ryan’” Peters remembered emphasizing his shock. No melee ensued and nobody got hurt. But for Peters that moment underscored the very essence of Langborg’s passion. “He’s a no BS guy” Peters noted. “He doesn’t mess around on the court. Even if it was a close friend like me he doesn’t take anything from anybody. He’s a cool relaxed guy but I’ll tell you what: he gets on that court a switch is turned. He turns into a beast.” In spite of treating every practice like an elimination contest those most familiar with Langborg at Princeton reinforce that his hard-line mentality doesn’t mean there’s no room for development — for himself or his peers. “By willing to be coached and willing to work hard and accepting responsibility for his own mistakes sometimes” Henderson said “the team was able to grow.” When Northwestern’s second-ever March Madness stint ended bitterly the team faced uncertainty: which of its stars its staple players over the last four years would return? Fingernails were chomped until the very last day — May 31 — at which point the ‘Cats learned that Big Ten Co-Defensive Player of the Year Chase Audige would remain in the NBA Draft. Audige’s departure came along with the transfer of forward Robbie Beran to Virginia Tech. With an immediate hole in his starting five needing to be plugged Northwestern head coach Chris Collins went to work in the transfer portal ultimately zeroing in on Langborg an eye toward shifting his team’s style of play relative to the year prior. “Ryan’s ability to put the ball in the hole to make plays for others is something we thought we really needed to address” Collins said. “We won a lot with our defense last year and we want to be a little bit more dynamic offensively. I think Ryan brings some of that on the perimeter.” Langborg displayed his shooting stroke with the Tigers sinking 66 threes in each of the last two campaigns. Playmaking was evident too: he hauled in 200 rebounds and dished out 104 assists from 2021-23. Sans Beran Northwestern is expected to utilize a “small ball” starting lineup of Boo Buie Langborg Ty Berry Brooks Barnhizer and Matthew Nicholson. Though the Wildcats may not have traditional size or length among that contingent Collins is energized by a new dimension emphasizing improved floor spacing passing and shooting. The reigning Big Ten Coach of the Year specifically praised Langborg’s skillset. “Ryan’s ability to handle the ball gets you a chance to move off a little bit and become more of a scorer and come off screens” Collins explained. “Not being solely in all pick-and-rolls which he’s really good at. I think Ryan brings great versatility to our perimeter.” On the Tigers Langborg was expected to be one of the team’s alpha scorers on a nightly basis. Now playing alongside Buie — a First Team All-Big Ten and All-American candidate — could provide more of a complementary role which Langborg is perfectly content doing. “Kind of be able to play off each other hit shots” Langborg said about the backcourt tandem. “Be able to create when he doesn’t have the ball.” Having two guards that can attack from multiple spots especially from downtown also makes Buie and Langborg a formidable duo. Now defenses have to be keenly aware of who’s driving versus which player is left isolated beyond the arc. “The amount of times that you can get in the lane and create space guys have to help off” Langborg said. “He’s been finding me for a lot of shots.” Langborg wore the purple and white from Welsh-Ryan Arena for the first time last Wednesday getting the starting nod in Northwestern’s exhibition win over McKendree. In 26 minutes of action the transfer posted 13 points three rebounds three assists three steals and a block but dealt with foul trouble getting whistled three times. As the Wildcats begin their full-fledged conference slate Langborg will likely only face amplified levels of physicality — but it’s something he feels prepared for. “I think it’s just hitting the weight room hard. Making sure I’m in tip-top shape” Langborg said. “I mean Ivy is a lot of playing at a slower pace with guys who play really smart. I think the Big Ten is more fastbreak stuff. A lot of more athletic guys taller guys. Just adjusting to that but it’s not too big of an adjustment.” Tonight Langborg makes his highly anticipated official debut for NU with the ‘Cats opening their 2023-24 season against Binghamton. Having made the NCAA Tournament for just the second time in program history eight months ago this year’s Northwestern team seeks the first ever consecutive seasons of a March run. At the center of the team’s aspirations is the transfer now donning No. 5 and taking the floor of Welsh-Ryan Arena. As for what fans can expect out of Langborg his Princeton peers were effusive in envisioning his impact. Peters a native Evanstonian joked that Langborg isn’t in need of his advice of how to navigate the city. But the Princeton guard familiar with his neighbors thinks the area will feel fondly about their new addition. “They’re going to love him” Peters said. “He knows how to relate to his teammates and he knows just how to relate to people in the community. He’s got a tendency to excite the crowd — not necessarily with dunking but just with his almost like a Steph Curry-esque type of style of play.” Now under the tutelage of his former boss in Collins Henderson expressed confidence in Langborg’s continued ascent and impact at Northwestern his understudy being at his former school only incentivizing him to cheer on the ‘Cats. “They’ll help find something to help continue to grow his game I’m sure” Henderson said. “He’s tough as nails and he’s not afraid of any big moment. They’re getting a hell of a player and person.” For Langborg the goal of his fifth year of college basketball is simple: help the Wildcats in any facet imaginable and return to the zenith of the sport — his experience on Princeton’s magical run only fueling his desire to reach new summits in purple. “Being my last year I’m not looking for my own accolades” Langborg said candidly. “I want to do whatever I can to help the team win whether that’s diving on the floor whether that’s scoring a bunch of points whatever it is. However I can help that’s my intention.” In fact his goal is to take his new institution somewhere it’s never gone before. “Coming off the Sweet 16 appearance and how special that was I want to hope to bring that experience and give this school something it deserves” Langborg said noting he was told that NU had never reached that stage of the postseason. “I think this group is special enough to do it. We’re all very together which is exciting and how we were at Princeton. I think we can make it happen.”],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Following Northwestern’s 10-7 loss at Wrigley Field to Iowa David Braun and Co. will head up to Madison in search of their first road win in almost three years. In his weekly media availability on Monday afternoon the interim head coach touched on those struggles Camp Randall’s atmosphere some players who stood out against the Hawkeyes and much more. Opening statement: “Back at it today with the group. Had productive morning meetings. An opportunity to review film with our guys and learn from the Iowa opportunity and where we can continue to improve and get better. Our guys will be back in the facility later this afternoon this evening as we dive full into Wisconsin prep. We’ve got a group that’s really excited about what’s still in front of it. Obviously very disappointed with the result of Saturday but I think this group understands that if we continue to make improvements each and every day out of practice — and that continues to show up on Saturdays — this group’s gonna give itself a chance to win games each and every Saturday. We have three guaranteed opportunities left. Those are opportunities that our team [is] really excited about. This group cares deeply about one another loves playing together and is gonna battle its tail off to ensure that we have opportunities to earn ourselves at least one more chance to play together moving forward. On having his father attend last Saturday’s game and on coaching a game in Madison fewer than 60 miles away from his hometown of Wales Wisconsin: “Coaching Big Ten football and doing it with a group like we have here at Northwestern is always really special. Having my dad at the game this past Saturday was more a testament and a credit to him than anyone else. Not to get into details he was dealing with some things this past week with his health. Didn’t think he was gonna be able to attend the game. In a very patient and stubborn manner worked with his doctor to ensure he could get down to the game. That wasn’t an opportunity that I thought he was gonna be able to join our family down there. I was glad he was able to share in that. “I’m just really excited for this team to have an opportunity to go up to Madison. It’s well-documented that we haven’t played our best football on the road this year. So it’s an incredible challenge against a really good Wisconsin team in an incredible environment. Our guys are excited to get into prep this afternoon.” On closing games strong defensively: “It’s with details. It comes down to little procedural things. For me I’ve evaluated every single decision that I’ve made in those closing moments of the game. There’s things that I can continue to improve on on the details. A lot of times when you prepare for those field goal block situations at the end of the game you’re preparing for the ball to be on a hash or not directly in the middle of the field. You’re looking to overload a side you’re looking to get to a max block. Going back on that I need to do a better job of putting our guys in the proper alignments to get pressure where we need pressure. Credit to Iowa’s kicker he put it right down the middle. You go back and look at the film. Were our guys straining were they in a position to potentially affect the kick? In some spots but we didn’t have them in the best situation. It comes down to all of us but starting with me on all the little details that are required to win in the Big Ten.” On the team’s road struggles and its preparation for road games: “This week will be unique. It won’t be a plane trip it’ll be a bus trip so it’ll look a little different. Ideally I think routine and rhythm are absolutely critical to any team whether it be home or away. We’ll certainly look to get our guys in rhythm and in routine while also evaluating if there are some areas that we can continue to improve. Especially on their gameday prep to make sure that our guys are ready to go. At the end of the day so much of it comes down to execution and really tuning out all the external environment that exists on the road. Madison’s certainly going to pose a lot of challenges in the regard. Against a team like Wisconsin — really well-coached plays good defense finds way to stress you on offense — it’ll be critical that we start fast.  “I’m excited for the challenge that’s ahead. The last time that this team was truly on the road out at Nebraska we certainly fell short. But I think there were a lot of lessons to pull from that experience and that opportunity. I think this group only continues to mature as each week goes by. That’s what we’re going to challenge them moving forward. We’re going to have to be a very mature group that’s executing at a really high level for four quarters to find a way to get it done in Madison.” On the meeting between Big Ten head coaches and commissioner Tony Petitti regarding the Michigan sign-stealing scandal: “I’m involved in all those conversations. I won’t share the content of those conversations but I was on that call.” On the allegations against Michigan and potential punishments: “That’s not in my lane. I will say that Commissioner Petitti has been an incredible leader and an incredible support system for me going through this transition. Fully trust that him and the rest of the Big Ten office will take proper steps to make sure they’re moving the conference forward in the appropriate manner.” On play-calling conversations with Mike Bajakian during Iowa’s goal-line stand: “It was very clear with Coach Bajakian that as long as we weren’t going backwards there would be an opportunity to go for it on fourth if it got to fourth down. Beyond that shoot hindsight’s 20-20. If you were to give me the play calls that were executed in that situation in that sequence where the ball was placed and say ‘Hey Dave are you comfortable with these play calls this sequencing that we’re going to score a touchdown?’ I would’ve said ‘Absolutely.’ I’ll put it on that group to find a way to get in the end zone. Not gonna second-guess that play calling. Were we disappointed with the result? Absolutely. But in hindsight it’s easy to be critical. I feel comfortable with the way that went down and the calls that were made.” On Ben Bryant’s injury status: “We’re taking that day-to-day. Ben’s made some incredible progress. Each day we’ll know more but I’m not willing to sit up here and say that he’s not going to be available. With the progression that he’s shown over the past couple weeks I think there’s a possibility that he’s ready to go.” On whether Bryant will start if he’s active against Wisconsin: “We’ll take that day-to-day. We’ll make a decision that we feel is in the best interest of the team in winning a football game. Tremendous amount of respect for the way that [Brendan Sullivan] has played and battled and fought for his team. The greatest statistic that you can hang your hat on as a quarterback is wins and losses. And what you see is a football team that is fighting its butt off and rallying around a bunch of guys including Brendan Sullivan.  “So that’s not a decision that’s been made yet but what I can say is if Ben is available that’s great and it’s gonna make it a really difficult decision for us as a coaching staff to deem who’s gonna put our team in the best situation to go win a football game.” On Xander Mueller: “He’s improved a ton. I still think he’s just scratching the surface. That’s a young man that’s taken full advantage of a spring ball of a fall camp has made a conscious and intentional effort to improve each day out at practice. Coach [Tim] McGarigle’s done an incredible job with him and the rest of that group. But the thing that shows up so consistently for Xander right now which is so exciting is is tempo and demeanor of play. He is flying around. I know that’s words that you hear coaches say all the time but literally you see that guy flash on film. Really excited about the growth and development that he’s had and excited for that continued to growth. He’s getting better and better each week. On preparing for Wisconsin running back Braelon Allen: “It starts off with some really good tackle circuit work and making sure that we’re keeping our eyes up getting our near foot in the ground running our feet through contact. He’s a talented back big back. Really good stiff arm. He’s gonna pick up four yards just by falling forward. But we’re going to have to do a great job in our fundamental and technique work just like we do every week in our indy. Our guys are going to have to do a great job in those scout periods of making sure that we’re getting in great body positions and replicating what we want to see on Saturday. And that’s good chest-to-chest contact eyes up running our feet and creating opportunities for knock-back tackles because if you’re not running your feet through contact he’s going to pick up six yards every time.” On instilling confidence in the team to turn 2022’s blowout losses into close games against the same opponents: “It sounds so cliche and I apologize for that but it really does come back to guys showing up taking it one day at a time. We talk about flushing the last game well whatever that result was against that opponent last year putting that in our rearview. I really believe this group has taken it seriously about finding a way to improve just a little bit each and every day. When every guy on our roster’s doing that you’re seeing some of the collective benefits of that. You got a team that believes that’s playing really hard that’s playing for one another. And I think they understand that if they continue to do that they’re going to give themselves a chance to come out with a victory each and every Saturday. We’ve just got to continue to hone in on the details continue to push but certainly lean back into the process that we’ve created over the course of the season. I think you have a group that is disappointed with the most recent result but is an awfully confident group right now.” On coaching in Camp Randall for the first time: “It’d be awesome to go into Camp Randall with this group of guys and bring a victory back to Evanston. That’s what we’re going to bust our butt [for] we’ve already started busting our butt. But over the course of the week making sure we’re doing everything in our power to put our guys in a situation to do just that. Bring a win back to Evanston.” On how much he’s paying attention to the outside results in the Big Ten West: “Very little. I know that’s part of conversation. Even just talking to people in the community they want to talk about that. The thing that we know and understand is the only way we’re going to have continued conversation about that is by winning our next football game. The challenge to this group moving forward is leave no doubt. Let’s not put our focus on anything other than improving each day and positioning ourselves to go 1-0 this week. We handle business let’s see where this thing plays out by the time we get to the end of the season.” On Jaylen Pate’s character and watching him rack up a sack and forced fumble against Iowa: “It’s awesome. It’s what Northwestern football this athletic department the university is all about. You’ve got a young man of really high character a young man that’s overcome a lot of adversity. Went out to Wyoming graduated in three years. Another man that we recruited heavily at North Dakota State spent a lot of time with Jaylen on his official visit when he was at North Dakota State. And got to know him not just as a football player but as a man and some of the things he’s really passionate about in terms of serving those that are in need of service. To see him put the same effort into some of his outside interests and things that he wants to do long-term while also putting an incredible amount of intention and effort into becoming the best football player that he can be. He’s turned himself into a pretty darn good Big Ten defensive end and really excited about what’s ahead of him the next few weeks.” Comparing late-season cold in Fargo North Dakota to late-season weather in Evanston: “There’s no doubt in our playoff runs up in Fargo playing in a 72-degree climate-controlled dome... there were no complaints about that on Saturdays about that that’s for sure. What I will tell you is Big Ten football is played outdoors. We know we’re going to have to deal with the elements in different ways each and every week. We’re certainly conscious of what we’re going to be dealing with on Saturday. But as many times as we can over the course of the next few weeks if there’s opportunities for us to be outside and just get in tune and comfortable with the elements that’s something that we’re going to do. For us to win in November it’s a different brand of football sometimes. Throwing the football is not always going to be advantageous when you’re dealing with wind precipitation and cold. To our guys’ credit they’ve really embraced that and we’ll certainly take advantage of that this week as well.” On prepping for Wisconsin quarterback Tanner Mordecai who has not played since Oct. 14 but was marked as questionable last Saturday: “I think you’ve got to prepare like you’re gonna see Tanner and understand that both quarterbacks are capable of playing winning football. We’ll certainly be mindful and be prepared for both quarterbacks. Tanner certainly brings a level of scramble ability and plus-one quarterback run game that makes you uneasy at times.” On Northwestern men’s basketball and his relationship with Chris Collins: “Coach Collins has been very supportive. Wealth of wisdom just in terms of his time being a head coach at this university and understanding ways we can recruit at a really high level understanding what Northwestern has to offer for the student-athlete experience. Really excited to continue to support him and his team. Really enjoyed being over at Welsh-Ryan Arena multiple times last year during that incredible run. Plan on supporting as much as I possibly can. I know Lucas and Andrew Braun get awfully fired up to be at Wildcat football games and are looking forward to being a huge part of basketball games this winter. Unfortunately we had some things going on at the house a couple weeks ago but they were planning on a couple Thursdays ago coming out and watching women’s field hockey and the incredible season that they’ve had. Big Ten Network I don’t know what their ratings look like but the Braun boys are helping their ratings wherever they’re at. If the Wildcats are on it doesn’t matter what sport it is. They’re tuned in they’re cheering their butts off.” On the biggest lessons he’s learned as a head coach: “It’s all about your people. It’s all about creating genuine relationships with players with staff with coaches. We’ve talked a lot about this group having an opportunity to write their own story. Unless you’re with this group on a consistent basis I don’t know if you’d ever completely understand but I think this group is really shining through in terms of their character their resiliency their togetherness. And that’s where it starts from a head coaching perspective. I think that’s what been so humbling about this opportunity. I’d like to think I’ve had a positive impact on everyone that’s a part of this program. “Secondly you never have it all figured out. You just show up each day doing your best continuing to have a mentality of humility and growth a willingness to listen and take input and constructive criticism and learn from those that are around you. Whether that be guys in our defensive staff room our offensive staff room Coach [Skip] Holtz Alex Knisely our Director of Football Operations there’s so much to continue to learn and grow in. But at the end of the day the decisions we’ve made have been putting our student-athletes at the forefront of those decisions. It really starts with those guys. If we’re not serving them we’re missing the mark. I’m proud of the way that we battled but I’m also really hungry to push this group to do continue to do incredible things moving forward. This group has so much more to accomplish this season and I’m confident that there’s a lot of special things ahead for them. On Garnett Hollis Jr. and Theran Johnson’s importance: “Absolutely critical. If you’re not playing at a high level at the corner position it doesn’t matter. And that’s not just in the pass game. That’s an upside run game a corner being a primary fitter as well as teams spreading you out and defending deep balls like you saw Theran do such a good job of on that play action pass with his interception on Saturday. Credit to those two credit to the depth in the room. Ore [Adeyi]’s been playing at a really high level there’s some other young guys in that room that continue to push for playing time and push that group. Coach [LaMarcus] Hicks has done a tremendous job with that group. But starting off with Garnett and Theran when those guys are at their best they’re quite the duo.” On whether he’ll burn the redshirt of Michael Kilbane who reached the four-game limit on Saturday: “We intend to continue allowing that young man to continue playing at a really high level. I don’t know if I’d say burn his shirt as much as Michael Kilbane is excited to help this team continue to push for a lot more victories.” On the effect of Memorial Stadium’s atmosphere on the team’s ability to deal with Camp Randall: “I think those opportunities always help. Especially when you’ve got some guys on this roster a relatively young football team that may have been one of their first experiences in an environment like that. That’s a perspective that’s experience that’s wisdom and those are opportunities to continue to grow. That experience only helps us moving forward and again something that our guys really embrace. When you’re getting an opportunity to get an education from Northwestern and play Big Ten football part of that is having opportunities to play in hostile environments like Camp Randall. It’s something that I know our guys are really excited to take head-on. They understand that we’ve got to play better on the road and it won’t be an easy task but a task that our guys are excited for.” \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Big Ten volleyball’s explosion this year makes every match feel like must-watch television. However that was far from the case for Northwestern’s two matches last week with its five-set win over Indiana nine days ago looking like a distant pit stop on Northwestern’s Big Ten itinerary. Let’s dive into what went wrong against the Fighting Illini and Golden Gophers. Northwestern @ Illinois (Nov. 1) With Julia Sangiacomo firmly back into the rotation after only playing a handful of points against the Hoosiers the return of the graduate outside hitter breathed new life into the lineup as she finished second on the team with ten kills against Illinois. Averie Hernandez’s 12 kills paced the ‘Cats’ offense but ultimately wasn’t enough to match Illinois’ potent attack led by Raina Terry’s 22 kills. The first set was tightly contested with Northwestern jumping out to an early 3-1 lead. After a couple of lead changes saw Illinois push in front 13-12 Averie Hernandez ignited four straight points for the ‘Cats to force an Illinois timeout and give the Wildcats a 16-13 advantage. Later in the opening frame a Hernandez blast down the line brought the set to a 23-23 draw but Illinois’ net-front presence spurred by a cheeky left-handed peg from Jessica Nunge gave the Fighting Illini an all-important first-set victory. Riding the momentum of its 25-23 first-set win Illinois could not be stopped to start the second set leaping out to an 8-1 lead. But Northwestern’s resilience powered by strong play from Leilani Dodson and Sangiacomo rallied the ‘Cats back into winning the next 19 of 31 points evening the match at 20-20. Illinois’ talent responded to Northwestern’s pushback and capped off the set with a 25-22 victory on a kill by Brooke Mosher. As if Northwestern’s second set was not painful enough the ‘Cats flirted with success in set three before falling to Illinois’ wrath. The teams went back and forth with the ‘Cats eventually earning a 22-21 lead but Illinois found an extra gear late rallying off a 4-1 run with a Terry slam to close things out in Huff Hall.  Alexa Rousseau ended with 30 assists Ellee Stinson led the way with 17 digs and Dodson finished with a team-high of four blocks as the ‘Cats fell to 5-8 in Big Ten play. Minnesota vs. Northwestern (Nov. 5) After the midweek defeat to Illinois Northwestern returned home to face a star-studded Minnesota team coming off a 3-1 win over Ohio State. Dodson carried Northwestern early in the opening set with three kills in Northwestern’s first six points. Hernandez feeding off Dodson’s offensive outburst joined in with three kills in the next four Northwestern points to power the ‘Cats onto a 5-0 run and a 10-6 lead. But Minnesota was able to equalize the score on a 4-0 run. Both teams traded punches back and forth until a 25-25 score demanded a winner by two. Northwestern answered the call with another Dodson kill and a Lauren Carter ace giving Northwestern an early 1-0 advantage. Minnesota came out firing in the second set racing out to a 4-1 lead. Northwestern battled with Sangiacomo and Hernandez helping the ‘Cats to a 9-7 edge. After a set of runs Minnesota responded with a 7-1 stretch before Northwestern answered with a 6-1 run of its own to take a 16-15 lead. The Golden Gophers then ripped four straight points. Although the ‘Cats came within one point six different times down the stretch Minnesota escaped with a crucial second-set victory. Northwestern had no solution for star Gopher Taylor Landfair as her eight kills in the second frame proved to be too much for the Wildcat defense. The third and fourth sets were more of the same for Northwestern: an uncanny ability to fail at finding a way to win close sets late. Northwestern found themselves in a 20-20 battle in set three but fueled by two kills from Lydia Grote Minnesota scored five of the last six points to seize a 2-1 advantage. In the fourth and final set Northwestern rallied from trailing 17-11 to leading 22-21 but without a clutch gene late the Gophers launched a 4-2 run to end the ‘Cats’ chances of a fifth set. Minnesota relied on the hot-handed Landfair in the final frame whose eight kills squashed Northwestern’s hopes of beating Minnesota in back-to-back seasons for the first time since 1987-1988. In the loss Sangiacomo finished with 16 kills Dodson had 13 kills and a career-high tying five digs and Hernandez extended her impressive offensive run with 11 kills making for her 10th double-digit kill total in 12 matches. Rousseau orchestrated the offense per usual with 47 assists while Stinson posted a match-high 25 digs for the ‘Cats. Minnesota had three double-digit kill-getters with Lanfair’s game-high 25 leading the way. Grote added 13 while McKenna Wucherer got 11 past the Northwestern defense. Melani Shaffmaster finished her day with a double-double thanks to 43 assists and a team-high 12 digs. So where does Northwestern go from here? With six matches left in conference play the road does not get any easier with Northwestern’s next game at the Devaney Center in Lincoln Nebraska. Northwestern also still has to play Penn State on the road and host Illinois. The Wildcats however do have the luxury of facing Iowa twice and Rutgers — two teams with a combined two conference wins in 28 games. With Northwestern desperate to climb its way back up the rungs of the Big Ten standings the margin for error is thinning as time is fading. The squad’s reliance on Sangiacomo and Hernandez firing away on all cylinders forces Northwestern’s fundamentals of blocking serve receive and serving to have to be perfect to pull out a win. Against Illinois and Minnesota silly mistakes and costly errors in close sets meant missed opportunities for Northwestern to cash in keeping the door open for the Fighting Illini and Gophers to hammer the Wildcats away. As Northwestern now faces a tough stretch of road games it’s time for the ‘Cats to embody the essence of the Big Ten: beat anybody on any given day. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Share this story At this point it should be very clear that Northwestern is very good. Scratch that. Dominant   unforgiving a powerhouse.  With 18 straight wins after dropping the season opener it seems the Wildcats are destined to win their second-ever national title just two seasons after their first. Here are the teams that could stand in the way.  North Carolina North Carolina and Northwestern hail from two different conferences and two different parts of the country but they have become each other’s ultimate foes as of late. The Wildcats took down the Tar Heels en route to their first championship in 2021 then fell to them with a minute left in the title game the following year. Northwestern has been ranked as the best team in the country for the past four weeks but it is North Carolina that heads into the NCAA Tournament as the No. 1 seed.  A final matchup between these teams would be fueled by the extra motivation to prove who is actually the best. The ACC champs have the best RPI in the country and are ranked 11th in scoring margin and 16th in penalty corners. The Big Ten champs have the second-best RPI lead D1 field hockey in scoring margin and average the second-most penalty corners per game.  Both are relatively on par in goals per game but for Northwestern to succeed being able to maximize its penalty corner play will be significant.  The Tar Heels will be riding on lots of movement in the postseason as arguably the most talked-about team in the nation. They just took down Duke which will be the No. 3 seed in the NCAA tournament to win their seventh ACC Championship. Notably all the attention has been on the 23-year-old head coach Erin Matson who led North Carolina to a 14-3 record in her first season.  Duke If Northwestern makes it to the Final Four there’s a good chance it will take on Duke.  The Blue Devils will take on American which isn’t ranked among the top 20 teams. If they advance it will face either Syracuse or Liberty. Duke easily beat Syracuse in the regular season 4-0 but just narrowly bested Liberty in overtime.  While the ‘Cats significantly lead the Blue Devils in offensive categories they are a rather unfamiliar opponent. While the teams have not clashed often NU bested Duke 3-2 earlier this season. Although Duke lost in the ACC Championship to UNC it lost by just one to its state foe in the season finale.  The Blue Devil have proven they can hang with top-tier teams and compiling a 16-4 season after going 7-11 gives them the fateful advantage of being the Cinderella team.  The Wildcats will have to watch out for Alaina McVeigh whose 20 goals are one away from leading the country.   Maryland/Rutgers Another possible championship matchup could be Northwestern’s Big Ten counterparts. Both Maryland and Rutgers have been among the top ten all season and both have put up a fight against the ‘Cats.  The Big Ten Championship was anything but easy. The ‘Cats came out on top 1-0 but it took two overtime periods and 20 corners — 17 of which came from NU alone.  This match drew comparisons to when the Wildcats and Scarlet Knights played each other in the regular season. Rutgers scored in the first quarter and NU didn’t tie it up until the fourth quarter. It then took two overtimes once again a round of shootouts and then an extra shootout before Northwestern won.  ""Northwestern is evidently the best team in the Big Ten but these three are very familiar with each others strengths and weaknesses at this point so a national title game could go any way. "" Northwestern has earned a bye and will host the winner of California and Miami Ohio in the second round of the NCAA Tournament on Friday.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story The leaves are falling the air is getting colder every day and sunset is at 4:30 p.m. With all the glory of winter — comes women’s college basketball. Last April 9.95 million viewers its largest audience ever tuned in to watch the NCAA women’s championship game and the sport will hopefully continue the upward trend in viewership this season. Specifically for the Big Ten the accomplishments were endless with Iowa appearing in the national championship for the first time ever alongside superstar national player of the year Caitlyn Clark. Prior to the finals it was the Big Ten’s first Final Four appearance as a conference since 2015. The conference made big waves throughout the tournament especially during the Sweet 16 when No. 3 Ohio State upset No. 2 UConn. Last Year: 31-7 (15-3 B1G) Big Ten Tournament Champions NCAA Championship Game appearance First Game: vs. Fairleigh Dickinson Biggest Game: vs. Ohio State Jan. 21 Caitlyn Clark. Playing all 38 games of the season she averaged 27.8 points 7.1 rebounds and 8.6 assists per game — having back-to-back 40-point games during March Madness. There needs no further explanation as to why Iowa can win the conference. The main thing for the Hawkeyes will be making those adjustments without Monika Czinano and McKenna Warnock both key starters that Clark relied on as roleplayers.  ""To live up to the hype behind this team Clark will have to find a way to create shots in the new rotation. For the second game of their season the Hawkeyes will have to face No. 8 Virginia Tech who upset Indiana in the tournaments second round. Will the Hawkeyes be ready for true adversity this early? After playing the Hokies Iowa has a relatively easy non-conference schedule that should allow for plenty of time to get into a rhythm before Big Ten play."" 2. No. 7 Ohio State Last Year: 28-8 (12-6 B1G) NCAA Elite 8 appearance First Game: vs. USC Biggest Game: vs. Iowa Jan. 21 Last season the Buckeyes shocked everyone in their 19-0 start led by freshman Cotie McMahon. The forward started all 36 games averaging 15 points over 30 minutes and still managed to hold opponents defensively. This is a team to keep your eye on to go deep in March Madness once again. With a versatile 6’4 center like Rebeka Mikulasikova who can defend shoot behind the arc and dominate the paint Ohio State’s defense is stellar. No one expected this team to get to the Elite 8 let alone upset the then No. 2 UConn team that had all the ability to win the national title. However the Buckeyes could give Iowa a run forits money during the regular season. This roster is comfortable with one another and will improve immensely with the addition of Duke transfer and ACC Defensive Player of the Year Celeste Taylor. 3. No. 9 Indiana Last Year: 28-4 (16-2 B1G) Big Ten Regular Season Champions NCAA Second Round exit Next Game: vs. Eastern Illinois Biggest Game: vs. Tennessee Nov. 23 During the NCAA Tournament this team had Final Four aspirations but was quickly upset by Miami in a close second-round matchup. After this disappointing end to their season the Hoosiers will be out for revenge this season. With a star in Mackenzie Holmes and an arsenal of guards — Sara Scalia Sydney Parrish Chloe Moore-McNeil and Yarden Garzon — Indiana has all the tools to win the regular season conference title. The real question for this team regards how the Hoosiers handle Grace Berger’s absence. Holmes will have to lead the effort for this team to keep up the high-scoring numbers. Mackenzie averaged 22.3 points last season shooting 68% from the field. But without the three-point machine in Berger who will step up? 4. No. 14 Maryland Last Year: 28-7 (15-3 B1G) NCAA Elite 8 appearance First Game: vs. Harvard Biggest Game: vs. South Carolina Nov. 12 After a run to the Elite 8 this team could prove to be great or could quickly decline. Maryland has a tough first couple of weeks of the season playing both UConn and South Carolina in the same week. The Terps will have to fill some serious holes in the loss of Diamond Miller and Abby Meyers their top two scorers. The lockdown defender in Shyanne Sellers will need to step up offensively to keep this team rolling. Incoming five-star recruit  Riley Nelson a great combo guard who takes every scoring opportunity could be a highlight reel for this team. Along with the first-year comes NC State transfer Jakia Brown-Turner whose scoring ability should help offset Miller’s loss.  5. No. 23 Illinois Last Year: 22-10 (11-7 B1G) NCAA First Four Out Next Game: vs. Morehead State Biggest Game: vs. Michigan Dec. 10 For the first time in 24 years Illinois women’s basketball is ranked in the Associated Press Preseason Poll coming in at No. 23. After their new head coach Shauna Green led them to one of the best seasons for a first season at a new school this team’s benefits from familiarity. The Illini return seven of their top-eight rotation players from last season’s NCAA tournament team including all five starters which is something not many teams can say with such a big year for the women’s basketball transfer portal. The main questions for Illinois will be if it can keep up the momentum and defeat other great teams. 6. Michigan Last Year: 23-10 (11-7 B1G) NCAA Second Round Exit Next Game: vs. Purdue Fort Wayne Biggest Game: vs. Illinois Dec. 10 In the last two seasons Michigan has had major successes from legacy players like Naz Hillmon Emily Kiser Leigha Brown and Maddie Nolan. The Wolverines will mainly be in recovery from losing their scorers and assist makers. With many uncertainties they only return two starters — junior guard Laila Phelia and senior forward Cameron Williams. Phelia had an amazing sophomore season — receiving All-Big Ten preseason honors after averaging 16.7 points and scoring 39 points on Indiana. Despite the fresh start for the Wolverines they have three experienced graduate students from the transfer portal in Elissa Brett from Bowling Green Lauren Hansen from Missouri and Taylor Williams from Western Michigan.  7. Purdue Last Year: 19-11 (9-8 B1G) NCAA First Four Out First Game: at UCLA Biggest Game: vs. Wisconsin Dec 30 Purdue opens their season against No.4 UCLA which will serve as a preview of what’s to come as regular conference play next season. Although the Boilermakers were in the first four out it was their first appearance in the NCAA Tournament since 2017 and their first winning conference play record since the 17-18 season. Purdue relied on interior scoring and their defense to win but with the loss of their top scorer Lasha Petree the Boilermakers will be looking for a new leader. 8. Nebraska Last Year: 18-15 (8-10 B1G) First Game: vs. Northwestern State Biggest Game: at Michigan State Dec. 9 Sunday afternoon Nebraska got the exciting news that five-star guard Britt Prince would be committing to play next season. Looking towards this season the Cornhuskers will not have their full roster missing Allison Weidner for the entire season due to a knee injury. Senior guard Jaz Shelley led the team in points assists and steals. In order for Nebraska to get out of the lull of alternating wins and losses they need better consistency game-to-game. Although shorthanded they still retain their leading rebounder Alexis Markowski who can also keep teams from scoring in the paint. 9. Michigan State Last Year: 16-14 (7-10 B1G) Next Game: vs. Oakland Biggest Game: vs. Nebraska Dec. 9 Honestly the Spartans record tells a different story about how their season went. While it may seem like they’re a team that skates above .500 a majority of their losses were in overtime or a six-point differential. However their entire system will be thrown for a loop as the program adjusts to a new coach. After 16 seasons Suzy Merchant stepped down as head coach and Michigan State hired Robyn Fralick to lead the upcoming season. With a coaching change and losing Matilda Ekh the Spartans’ second-leading scorer to the transfer portal the Spartans will need the younger talent on the roster to step up. 10. Rutgers Last Year: 12-20 (5-13 B1G) Next Game: vs. Monmouth Biggest Game: vs. Penn State Jan. 14 Last season Rutgers was beginning what seems to be a long rebuilding process as they learn under new head coach Coquese Washington. The team had relatively no depth with only eight players on the roster most reliant on senior Awa Sidibe. The guard started every game and averaged 9.3 points over 33.3 minutes while shooting 42% from the field. The Scarlet Knights only had two players Sidibe and Chyna Cornwell start in every game. Their leading scorer Kaylene Smikle had a great freshman year averaging 17.9 points playing in every game last season. The offseason was crucial for this squad where they landed a true point guard — a position where they had no clear go-to — in Texas A&M transfer Mya Petticord. Another big acquisition through the transfer portal for the Scarlet Knights was Destiny Adams from UNC. With so much up in the air about potential lineups and consistency Rutgers will need to prove themselves to beat other Big Ten teams. 11. Wisconsin Last Year: 11-20 (6-12 B1G) Next Game: vs. Milwaukee Biggest Game: vs. Rutgers Jan. 27 The Badgers are a young dynamic team that can push the tempo of other teams especially with the experience of senior Brooke Schramek. Having only two seniors on the roster Wisconsin has many years ahead of familiarity with five freshmen coming on this year. Even if the Badgers don’t win many more games compared to last season they have a player who could very well be a star in Serah Williams. The returning sophomore made the Big Ten’s all-freshman team last season after leading the team in points rebounds blocks and field-goal percentage. The duo of Schramek and Williams could be extremely successful with some added defensive help from freshman D’Yanis Jimenez.  12. Penn State Last Year: 14-17 (4-14 B1G) Next Game: vs. Bucknell Biggest Game: vs. Rutgers Jan. 14 Despite its record Penn State showed some promise late last season in the Big Ten tournament defeating Minnesota in the first round. After a disheartening six-game losing streak the Nittany Lions needed the morale boost to close off the year. Coming into the new season they will have five new players from the transfer portal that fit head coach Carolyn Kieger’s fast offensive game. This aggressive approach to the portal could either propel Penn State above all expectations or at the very least make them more competitive in conference play.  13. Northwestern Last Year: 9-21 (2-16 B1G) Next Game: vs. UIC Biggest Game: vs. Georgetown Dec. 3 I can’t bring myself to rank the ‘Cats at No. 14 even as possible as that is. There’s not much to say regarding last season after only beating two conference teams Wisconsin and Minnesota. But with lots of returners NU has a chance to make a turnaround this season. The best way the ‘Cats can improve upon last season is by maximizing Caroline Lau and Caileigh Walsh on offense and keeping Hailey Weaver on defense. Once the Wildcats find their niche whether they choose to focus on scoring or locking down players they could become much more consistent.  14. Minnesota Last Year: 11-19 (4-14 B1G) Next Game: vs. Long Island Biggest Game: vs. Drake Dec. 2 Minnesota is one of the many women’s basketball programs going through coaching changes. After the underwhelming season head coach Lindsay Whalen stepped down and just weeks later the Gophers announced Dawn Plitzuweit to be her replacement.  Although only winning four games Minnesota led the Big Ten in rebounds last season averaging 41.9 rebounds per game. Throughout the season the Gophers had strong wins but hard losses and Plitzuweit has a history of emphasizing defensive play to win. She joins a solid foundation with a young core of sophomores in Mara Braun Mallory Heyer Nia Holloway and Amaya Battle. Heyer is the perfect fit for Plitzuweit’s coaching style because of her ability to hit the glass and act as a big defensive player for the Gophers. Braun led the team in scoring 15.6 points per game while Battle led in assists and blocks. As they navigate their new era this season will play a large role in a rebuild. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story As the month turned to November Northwestern traveled to the friendly confines to take on the Iowa Hawkeyes. In a game dominated by punts the Hawkeyes were able to eke out a 10-7 win at Wrigley Field. With the Wildcats looking to bounce back in Wisconsin next Saturday here are some takeaways from the ‘Cats’ loss at Wrigley Field. Offensive woes doom the ‘Cats again For 58 minutes Northwestern’s defense had only given up seven points and those only came after a blocked punt. But for 57 minutes NU laid a goose egg. The ‘Cats’ offense looked abysmal for most of the game. The Wildcats put up 170 total yards and had to punt eight times. Brendan Sullivan was sacked five times on Saturday which has happened in all but one of his starts this season. On the ground the Wildcats averaged a measly 2.2 yards per carry.  In the epitome of this game Northwestern failed to punch the ball in from the two-yard line on four plays. The Wildcats ran the ball up the gut on each play and Iowa stuffed them every time. Mike Bajakian showed no creativity at the goal line even after the same play didn’t work multiple times. Is Iowa’s defense one of the best in the nation? Absolutely. However Northwestern now has three games this year where it did not break double digits and cost itself wins. Penalties galore Once again the ‘Cats shot themselves in the foot multiple times on Saturday. The team has seven penalties for 71 yards; comparatively Iowa only had three for 30 yards. It is not like these were meaningless penalties they cost NU the game. To start the second half  Thomas Gordon got called for what feels like a weekly holding penalty and sent NU backward 10 yards. Because the ‘Cats were so far from the line to gain they ended up having to punt. What happened on that punt? It was blocked and Iowa capitalized on the short field to score its lone touchdown of the game.  It feels like there is always one penalty each week that either costs NU points or gifts the opponents points. David Braun has said multiple times that he will live with aggression penalties but the ‘Cats are making the same mistake over and over again. These have to get cleaned up or it will continue to hurt Northwestern’s chances of becoming bowl-eligible. Northwestern needs a back-by-committee approach As much as Cam Porter means to Northwestern it is clear he does not have the same juice that he had in 2020. Porter seems to have lost a step and often struggles to get downhill quickly. Fortunately for Northwestern it has two other backs who can help carry the load. Tre Tyus III looked great on Saturday getting downhill and churning his legs for extra yards. At 225 pounds he is a bruising back that can pick up short yardage situations. His never touching the ball around the goal line is baffling. To compliment Tyus Joseph Himon II is a pure speed back that is a problem to bring down in the open field.  He can flat-out fly and his shiftiness allows him to elude defenders and turn a basic play into a home run. He brings an element to the offense that the ‘Cats desperately need. The fact he only had one touch against Iowa is questionable at best when everyone can see he needs the ball more. This group can be a three-headed monster but Mike Bajakian and Chris Foster need to get the younger duo the ball throughout the game. The run defense is improving  But didn’t Iowa go over 100 yards on the ground? It did; however it took 41 carries to get there. The Hawkeyes averaged 2.5 yards per carry which somehow was the higher of the two teams. We are only a month removed from Darius Taylor rushing for nearly 200 yards but it is night and day from the defensive line. Despite being undermanned the ‘Cats have been winning at the line of scrimmage and eliminating the chunk play on the ground. Christian Smith and Braun deserve an immense amount of credit for the group’s improvement over the season. There is a lot of young talent on this team and for the first time in a while I believe that those players will be developed properly into meaningful Big Ten starters. The ‘Cats need to close games better There have been multiple games where opponents have given NU a scare and the Wildcats have been able to hold on but Iowa was able to take advantage and steal a victory. NU’s bend-don’t-break mentality works for a touchdown but a field goal is a whole other story. Iowa only had to get into field goal range which is quite long for Drew Stephens yet the Wildcats kicked it off short and made the Hawkeyes’ drive much easier. Further the play call to give Iowa a hole shot put it instantly in field goal range. At that moment you can’t let any chunk play happen so play tight coverage and make Deacon Hill beat you over the top. It is frustrating because the defense played so well yet gave up the big play when it mattered most. Braun is a young coach and will learn from this but in the Big Ten every game is going to be tight. Northwestern has to find a way to hold on in these matchups and not allow opponents to crawl their way to victory. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Northwestern’s Week 10 loss to Iowa was definitely disappointing. After a stellar outing against Maryland the ‘Cats had a chance to upset the Hawkeyes and give themselves a real shot at the Big Ten West title. Instead they failed to capitalize on countless opportunities to jump in front and fell to the Hawkeyes at Wrigley Field.  Wisconsin’s Week 10 loss against Indiana was even worse. The Badgers who opened the season at No. 19 on the AP Top 25 Poll had just fallen to no. 3 Ohio State and looked to Indiana as a chance to right the ship. After all the Hoosiers were 2-6 entering the game — still in search of their first Big 10 win. It looked like the perfect chance for the Badgers to get back on track. Instead Indiana pounced all over the Badgers and fell to a humble 5-4 on the 2023 campaign.  After suffering tough losses last week both teams are desperate to get back in the win column on Saturday. Here are three matchups to look for.  An entire month has passed since Wisconsin last scored in the first quarter. Yes that’s right. Crucial as a fast start may be the Badgers have struggled in the opening frame as of late and now it’s catching up to them. They’ve dropped three of their last four and last week they once again were unable to erase an early deficit against Indiana. It’s a troubling pattern that repeatedly puts them at a disadvantage to win. For Northwestern the first quarter failures of Wisconsin should be looked at as an opportunity. Considering the stellar defense Northwestern has played in recent weeks an early lead could become a relatively safe one. It would be nice to see the Wildcats play aggressive football early on taking some risks to try and secure a quick advantage.  Currently day-to-day with an ankle injury Wisconsin star running back Braelon Allen’s status for Saturday is still uncertain. When healthy he is a massive bright spot for an otherwise underwhelming Badger offense. Bringing great physicality and grit up front he is widely considered to be one of the top running backs in the country. He averages almost 6 yards per carry and has rushed for over 100 yards four times. If he plays he will certainly pose a challenge for Northwestern’s defensive front. After a rough start to the season Northwestern’s front seven has really picked up its play over the past few weeks. The physicality was especially present last week when the ‘Cats held the Hawkeyes to just 2.5 yards per carry. If Bryce Gallagher Aidan Hubbard and the crew can maintain that same level of physicality NU may have a chance at containing the Wisconsin run game.  Pass coverage has been a defensive strength all year for Northwestern. Led by Coco Azema Rod Heard II and Devin Turner the ‘Cats’ secondary unit has performed against the Big 10’s best QBs most notably Penn State’s Drew Allar and Maryland’s Taulia Tagovailoa. On Saturday the Wildcats will look to do the same with Wisconsin’s passing attack — whoever suits up at QB. With Tanner Mordecai also battling an injury for the Badgers it is still unclear whether it will be him or backup Braedyn Locke lining up under center. Regardless of who has been at quarterback many Badger fans can say that the air attack has been quite underwhelming this season. It was expected that hiring head coach Luke Fickell from Cincinnati and bringing in Mordecai from the transfer portal would spark significant improvement in Wisconsin’s pass game. Instead the Badgers have seen inconsistency and stagnancy at QB reminiscent of last year — Mordecai or Locke.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story With No. 4 Michigan State and Rutgers losing their opening games the madness of Big Ten basketball is officially back. Although Northwestern was in danger of joining the Spartans and Scarlet Knights at halftime the ‘Cats mustered out a hard-earned victory in a game that was too close for comfort. Here are three things we learned from the season-opening win. If all else fails turn to Buie and Barnhizer Coming into this season it was clear that Boo Buie and Brooks Barnhizer would have to carry Northwestern’s scoring load. But with only six players scoring points against the Bearcats the duo’s offensive output was Northwestern’s fail-safe plan. Buie dropped 27 points on 9-20 shooting while making three-of-eight from deep. Barnhizer had his third career double-double picking up where he left off last season with 18 points on 4-14 shooting 13 rebounds two blocks and four steals. Neither was incredibly efficient; however neither was Northwestern’s offense. As Northwestern looked to bury the Bearcats leading 53-50 with 6:26 remaining in the second half Buie and Barnhizer were the only Wildcats to score for the rest of the night racking off the ensuing 19 Northwestern points to finish things off. If anybody was questioning how the offense will operate in tight games it’s clear it’ll be the Buie and Barnhizer show. Northwestern needs to run the floor better Defensively the first half was an appalling performance for the normally stout Northwestern defense. Giving up 39 points to Binghamton felt like a punch in the mouth after Northwestern found its identity by protecting the basket a season ago. In the halfcourt Northwestern was late on its rotations but what really stood out was the ‘Cats’ inability to get back and stop the ball in transition. On this play a Northwestern miss had the Wildcats scrambling back down the floor allowing Binghamton’s Dan Petcash to find the seam and finish with an easy layup at the basket. Matt Nicholson misplayed his positioning in the paint focusing to guard his man rather than stop the ball leading to two easy points for the Bearcats. A similar sequence is here with Binghamton pushing the ball in transition down the middle of the floor. No Northwestern body positions itself in the middle of the paint to stop the ball forcing Barnhizer to catch up and commit the foul at the rim.  “They really had us on our heels [in the first half]” head coach Chris Collins said in the postgame press conference. “They were getting the ball out fast. They were pushing the ball. We were getting cross-matched in transition.” Northwestern simply got beat down the floor in the first half against the Bearcats. Although the ‘Cats held Binghamton to 22 second-half points giving up preventable points in transition is simply unacceptable for a team without a high octane offense. Offensively too Northwestern needs to push the ball when it has numbers. Too many times Northwestern moseyed its way down the floor opting to play in a half-court set. Although Northwestern has a little more offensive firepower than a season ago this team does not have the ability to consistently dominate its half-court game. Out of the Wildcats’ 72 points only seven were on the fastbreak. Improving the ‘Cats’ ability to snag extra points in transition has to be a point of emphasis for a team that finished 12th in the Big Ten in scoring per game last year. Chris Collins trusts Jordan Clayton If you look down the box score you’ll see Jordan Clayton finished with no points two rebounds one assist and a steal. Hardly inspiring stuff from the first year out of Medford Massachusetts. However No. 11 played 17 minutes — the most minutes out of any bench playing only one minute less than senior starter Ty Berry. “For him to come in as a freshman and give us that dirty work and that defense was pretty impressive” Collins said in the postgame presser. Clayton played a respectable six minutes in the first half two minutes less than Denver transfer Justin Mullins. But with Ryan Langborg banging up his left foot in the second half Collins turned to Clayton to fill the void over Mullins. Clayton’s strong on-ball defense physical play and high IQ are traits that the ‘Cats admire in the young guard.  “[Clayton] just bought in from the jump” Buie said in the postgame press conference. “He was one of the best guards on the defensive end tonight. Without his contribution we don’t win that game tonight.” Despite his success Clayton seemed cautious and afraid to be aggressive with the basketball after missing his only two attempts. Nonetheless with the way Collins managed the lineup in the season opener expect Clayton to be a versatile plug-and-play guy that Northwestern will look to utilize off the bench. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Northwestern basketball is officially back. The Wildcats look to return to the NCAA Tournament for a second straight year but they face a pretty tough schedule ahead. NU beat the Binghamton Bearcats in its season opener but it wasn’t pretty. Chris Collins’ squad is set to play in six ranked matchups this season and face off against nine different opponents who were dancing last March. Last year’s schedule was arguably just as rough if not more so than this year’s. Yet Northwestern found a way to get hot at the right times and won the biggest games finding its way to a postseason bid. This coming season the same things will likely define NU’s trajectory and whether the ‘Cats can hit their ceiling.  vs. Purdue (Dec. 1) This is for good reason the game every Northwestern fan has been looking forward to all off-season. The ‘Cats shocked the world when in a pivotal mid-February matchup Boo Buie and Co. led a comeback victory against the then-top team in the nation and earned a season-defining win.  This year that matchup comes a bit earlier but it is nevertheless extremely important. This time around the way Northwestern fares against the Boilermakers — who are currently ranked No. 3 in the country — can potentially set the tone for the way they will rebound from a miraculous 2022-23 season. A lot of things are going to have to go right though just as they did the last time these two teams matched up in Evanston.  Above all else Northwestern is going to have to worry a lot about the 7-foot-4-inch beast that is Zach Edey alongside a mature corps of guards who are dangerous from deep. If the ‘Cats can recreate their magic again though they’ll be sending a message to the college basketball world that they’re picking up right where they left off.  vs. Arizona State (Dec. 20) Although not many people are talking about it arguably Northwestern’s hardest non-conference matchup this year will be against an ASU team that is also coming off a tournament appearance. The Sun Devils lost a lot of their top talent from the year before but they bring back senior guard and Michigan transfer Frankie Collins who is sure to headline the scoring for this team as well as former 5-star and Illinois transfer Adam Miller. Last season the Wildcats received a couple of big wake up calls amidst back-to-back losses in non-conference play versus then-No. 13 Auburn and Pittsburgh which in many ways allowed NU to take note of its flaws before Big Ten play commenced. Given that nearly every other non-conference game they have this season are “tune-ups” against mid-major competition this Arizona State game is going to be big for the entire team to really see what it’s made of before it heads straight into the thick of the conference slate.  vs. Michigan State (Jan. 7) Speaking of their tough conference schedule the first home game on the 2024 calendar sees the Wildcats host the No. 4 Michigan State Spartans a powerhouse of Big Ten basketball (though MSU’s loss to JMU to kick off the year does dampen its allure). If the ‘Cats want to start the new year off right a big win like this one will go a long way.  Despite its loss to JMU Michigan State is the team to beat in the Big Ten — outside of Purdue of course. The Spartans are nothing short of stacked: they bring back the experienced guard duo of Tyson Walker and AJ Hoggard as well as freshman phenom Coen Carr who can jump out of the gym.  For Northwestern to win it will have to see massive games from its most experienced players: Boo Buie will need to be the rock for the team while guys like Brooks Barnhizer Ryan Langborg and Matthew Nicholson will have to be productive secondary guys. The contest against the Spartans will help the Wildcats discover who they can rely on in the clutch and make clear the real potential of this team.  vs. Illinois (Jan. 24) Similar to Michigan State a home matchup versus No. 25 Illinois is a prime opportunity for the Wildcats to prove themselves. The ‘Cats will be 17 games into their season so picking up a big win for the tournament resume is definitely going to be a big focus.  Last year the Wildcats split their matchups with Illinois winning at home and losing away. The two foes play twice again this season and both will likely be in the middle of the pack in the Big Ten making the outcome of the two games more important than ever. The Fighting Illini have a lot of front-court talent so for an NU win it will be important for the ‘Cats to hold their own in the rebounding game while exploiting some of Illinois’ under-experienced guards.  at Indiana (Feb. 18) As Northwestern will be approaching the end of its season racking up as many wins as it can to uphold both a solid record and resume is going to be key to making March Madness for the second year in a row. The Hoosiers lost their top two scorers but they’ve brought in a stud transfer center in Kel’el Ware and retained a pair of valuable senior guards Xavier Johnson and Trey Galloway. In Indiana’s opener versus Florida Gulf Coast the trio combined for 43 points and 20 rebounds. It would be no surprise if Indiana is ranked by the time it faces off with NU for this matchup so picking up a win here would be massive especially in the eyes of the selection committee.  at Maryland (Feb. 28) Much like the game at Indiana a road game versus a solid opponent in Maryland makes this game all the more exciting. The stakes will be higher than ever in one of the Wildcats’ final regular season games of the year.  Despite the big loss of Hakim Hart the Terrapins still have their two top scorers on the roster in Jahmir Young and Julian Reese. The Terps finished fifth in the B1G last year and they were on Northwestern’s hip all season as a level contender. This year will likely see a similar scenario play out. If both teams near the end of the season with comprable records — in-conference and overall — this matchup will be a major factor in Northwestern’s fate and it’ll surely be circled on Chris Collins’ calendar come February.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story As I exited the bleachers of Wrigley Field on Saturday all I could ask myself was “what could’ve been?” What could’ve been if all those questionable penalties and calls didn’t go against Northwestern? If Northwestern didn’t come up empty when it had four chances to score a touchdown from the one-yard line? Or if the ‘Cats’ defense was able to stop Iowa from getting into field goal range on its final drive? These are all questions that we will unfortunately never get an answer to. Nevertheless it was a mesmerizing experience to watch a football game at Wrigley. Including a flyover after the national anthem a trophy presentation for Northwestern’s NCAA champion lacrosse team at halftime and famed sports commentator (and Northwestern alum) Michael Wilbon singing “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” at the end of the third quarter the atmosphere at Wrigley didn’t leave much to be desired. The football however certainly did. I’m not the first to say this but the 60 minutes played at Wrigley set the game of football back decades. Both offenses showed no prowess whatsoever and could only muster up 17 combined points in the process. Having watched the Jets-Giants game the weekend before I had already experienced one of the most lethargic offensive showings one could ever imagine. This game occurring only six days later made for some good competition. Northwestern’s 2023 season has been nothing short of a rollercoaster with each week and game providing a whirlwind of emotions ups and downs and unpredictable moments. Ahead of Iowa confidence was soaring after a shocking upset victory over Maryland in which the ‘Cats’ offense found its spark with Brendan Sullivan under center. Sullivan’s monster game along with a tenacious defensive showing against a ferocious Maryland offense were welcome surprises for a Northwestern team needing a late-season push to stay in contention for a bowl game. Unfortunately Saturday’s game seemed to change the narrative. Brendan Sullivan who shined against Maryland couldn’t find answers against a considerably superior Iowa defense. He played scared and forced Mike Bajakian’s offense to become exceedingly reliant on short passes and runs which didn’t bode well against the Hawkeyes’ front seven. The defense held its own for the most part – albeit against a dreadful offense – but the NU offense didn’t play the complimentary football that David Braun prided his team on following the victory two weeks ago. Going into this weekend’s game against Wisconsin there is lots of uncertainty for both teams. I may have called this game unwinnable when I discussed NU’s bowl prospects a few weeks ago but much has changed since. The Badgers are dealing with an abundance of injuries on offense including quarterback Tanner Mordecai and star running back Braelon Allen. Their absence has been felt with Wisconsin losing a stunner to Indiana last weekend and only winning one of their past four games. David Braun will also have to answer some questions about his starting quarterback going forward if Ben Bryant is deemed healthy enough to play. Given Bryant’s earlier successes and Sullivan’s form over his past few starts that decision will be a tough one. It could be pivotal in determining the outcome of Northwestern’s final three games. As the headline suggests I’m not upset with Northwestern for how the Iowa game played out. This season’s results have far eclipsed our expectations with the ‘Cats winning games no one foresaw them having a chance in only a couple of months ago. Losing by a mere three points to Iowa a team with one of the best defenses in the country isn’t a sorrowing result by any means. However given the current context of this season along with all the missed opportunities the ‘Cats let go I can attest that I’m slightly disappointed by the final product. The fact that our expectations have changed this much in such a short period tells us a lot about the caliber of success that Northwestern football has reached. If you told me in early September that the ‘Cats would lose 10-7 to Iowa I’d be incredibly surprised by the close result. Now two months later the fact that I am dissatisfied with this result is a good thing and signals how drastically the perception of this team has changed. While the loss to Iowa is a crushing one I don’t see it as a step backward but rather a step sideways that makes the path a little more rocky. The opportunities still exist for Northwestern to become bowl-eligible for the first time since 2020 needing two more wins to reach the six-win threshold to automatically qualify. With games against Wisconsin Purdue and Illinois the ‘Cats can do just that. For one Purdue is a very winnable matchup in what should be the final game at Ryan Field before renovations commence. While Illinois has gotten hot lately that game presents a massive opportunity as well. Wisconsin is undoubtedly the most difficult of the three but it’s certainly not a lost cause for the ‘Cats as it previously seemed. Even if the ‘Cats don’t make a bowl game we still shouldn’t be upset about how this season has gone. Everyone thought this year would be a repeat of 2022 and for NU football to be in this position to begin with is a crowning achievement on its own. David Braun should be in contention for B1G Coach of the Year and warrants having his interim tag removed now or during the offseason. He deserves the chance to coach this team without the association of its past failures that forced him into his current predicament. This is a reinvigorated Northwestern team and Braun should be the figurehead that leads this program into the future in an even more challenging conference next season and beyond. So even as Northwestern’s season took a turn in the wrong direction last Saturday now is not the time to throw in the towel. The ride isn’t over just yet. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story The ‘Cats’ 2023 season is entering its final stage but many former Wildcats in the NFL are right in the thick of things. Rookies and vets alike made their presences known on contenders pretenders and laughingstocks this past week with many vying for larger roles as the NFL season wears on. Adetomiwa Adebawore: Indianapolis Colts DE Adebawore made an appearance in his fifth career NFL game this past Sunday in the Colts’ 27-13 rout of the Panthers taking the field for a career high 30% of defensive snaps and 32% of special teams snaps. Being on the field a lot is one thing but making an impact is another. Adebawore recorded his first career tackle in the first half sending Carolina punt returner Raheem Blackshear into the ground at his own 44. Later on Adebawore made an impact with his first NFL sack taking down fellow rookie Bryce Young for a loss of nine yards to all but seal the game for his team in the fourth quarter. Week 10 matchup: at New England Patriots in Frankfurt (11/12 8:30 AM CT) Rashawn Slater: Los Angeles Chargers OT Slater once again led the Chargers’ O-Line to a decisive victory this time in the form of a 27-6 blowout of the Jets on Monday Night Football. For the eighth straight game Slater appeared in every single one of his team’s offensive snaps helping to stifle a defensive unit that had allowed the second-fewest yards in the air to that point. The Jets sacked Justin Herbert a whopping five times on Monday night with six different players recording at least half a sack. But Slater and the O-Line managed to block for the run game as Austin Ekeler provided two rushing touchdowns — the only times the Bolts’ offense found the end zone. Week 10 matchup: vs. Detroit Lions (11/12 3:05 PM CT) Peter Skoronski: Tennessee Titans OT After returning from an injury earlier this season it might’ve worried ‘Cats fans to not see Skoronski out on the field for every snap on Sunday. Not to worry though as Skoronski still participated in 91% of those offensive snaps as well as four more on the special teams end. Titans’ quarterback Will Levis was sacked a whopping four times in the team’s 20-16 loss to the Steelers but still managed to snap off 22 completions for 262 yards with Skoronski and company protecting him. A down week for the Titans’ O-Line but a clear fix with Skoronski’s full return for Week 10 imminent. Week 10 matchup: at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (11/12 12:00 PM CT) Ben Skowronek: Los Angeles Rams WR It was a rough week for Skowronek who just a week after hauling in his first NFL receiving touchdown picked up negative yardage in a brutal 20-3 loss to the Packers. Quarterback Brett Rypien entrusted Skowronek with a handoff in the first quarter the first he had taken since Week 2. He promptly went to his left and ended up with -2 yards on the play forcing fourth down and a Rams punt to cap off the first drive of the game. Week 10 matchup: Bye week Cameron Mitchell: Cleveland Browns DB Mitchell had his most productive game in his young NFL career on Sunday racking up a career high four combined tackles and his first career pass defended in a 27-0 rout of the lowly Arizona Cardinals. All of his tackles came when the Cardinals were 10 or more yards away from a first down but his defense of a Clayton Tune pass to Greg Dortch is a significant milestone in his pro career. It may be a sign of what’s to come if the rest of the Browns’ secondary stays banged up. Week 10 matchup: at Baltimore Ravens (11/12 12:00 PM CT) Anthony Walker Jr.: Cleveland Browns LB Contributing to the Browns’ nine passes defended is Mitchell’s teammate Anthony Walker Jr. He batted down a pass intended for Marquise Brown on third down to force a Cardinals’ three-and-out on their first drive of the second half. Aside from that Walker didn’t have much of a chance to contribute. He recorded two assisted tackles in the first half but only ended up playing in 62% of the Browns’ defensive snaps — his third lowest usage rate of the season. Still the Browns found other ways to pull out a win. Week 10 matchup: at Baltimore Ravens (11/12 12:00 PM CT) Other Wildcats in the NFL: Greg Newsome II (Browns) Dean Lowry (Vikings) Godwin Igwebuike (Steelers) Joe Jones (Titans) Earnest Brown IV (Rams) Blake Hance (Jaguars) Tyler Lancaster (Broncos) Joe Gaziano (Falcons) Trevor Siemian (Jets)  Ifeadi Odenigbo (Jets) Evan Hull (Colts) \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Some of the rankings are still pretty nebulous but any remaining questions will be answered soon. That’s what November college football is all about. "" 1. Michigan (9-0 6-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 1 Last Result: 41-13 win versus Purdue Next Game: at No. 11 Penn State Another week another ho-hum blowout for Michigan. The Wolverines continue to annihilate all comers with their top-ranked scoring defense allowing just 6.67 points per game. Purdue was merely the latest in a long line of victims tallying just 10 first downs over 60 minutes on Saturday. While the outside world debates what consequence (if any) should result from the massive sign stealing scandal that has rocked the college football world Michigan continues to focus on the path ahead. Their next game will be their toughest to date as the Wolverines have to travel to State College. Penn State and Michigan are the only two FBS teams to average over 40 points per game while also allowing less than 14 points per game. 2. Ohio State (9-0 6-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 2 Last Result: 35-16 win at Rutgers Next Game: versus Michigan State Yeesh. Congratulations to the Buckeyes for once again gritting out a win but that was ugly. The defense once again looked incredible (the Buckeyes still haven’t given up more than 17 points in a game this year) but the offense once again floundered. A 9-7 deficit to Rutgers (even a very good Rutgers team) is something that shouldn’t happen to the top-ranked team in the nation.  And yet the Buckeyes are 9-0. They also have a get-right game against a severely offensively challenged Michigan State team this weekend. But mark your calendars: the next iteration of Ohio State-Michigan is less than three weeks away. 3. Penn State (8-1 5-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 3 Last Result: 51-15 win at Maryland Next Game: versus No. 3 Michigan  Well the offense is back. Drew Allar threw for 240 yards and four touchdowns in a dominant romp over Maryland as Penn State fully regained form. This is a team with one of the best offenses and one of the best defenses in the country. Its one issue is that under James Franklin this program hasn’t yet won the big game. It’ll have a really good chance this weekend. If Penn State is truly legitimate as a contender for the Big Ten title it has to take down Michigan this weekend. 4. Rutgers (6-3 3-3 B1G) Last Ranking: 5 Last Result: 35-16 loss versus Ohio State Next Game: at Iowa Here are the rushing stats for Rutgers over the weekend: 43 carries 252 yards and 5.4 yards a pop. That’s against Ohio State the top-ranked team in the CFP rankings. The Scarlet Knights has an offense and if they’d been even passable in the red zone they may have pulled a season-defining upset.  This was the closest a Rutgers-Ohio State game has ever been proving the Scarlet Knights’ talent. Against Iowa they should be able to get back on the winning track — if they can convert in the red zone. 5. Iowa (7-2 4-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 4 Last Result: 10-7 win at Northwestern Next Game: versus Rutgers They keep getting away with it and I do not understand how. The Hawkeyes had 169 yards on Saturday — TOTAL! This offense is genuinely an affront to football and yet this team is a questionable fair-catch call away from being 8-1 and probably a top-15 team in the CFP rankings. Please Rutgers. Win on Saturday. This team should not be the one that gets smacked 44-3 in Indianapolis in the Big Ten title game. 6. Maryland (5-4 2-4 B1G) Last Ranking: 6 Last Result: 51-15 loss versus Penn State Next Game: at Nebraska That’s now four consecutive losses for the Terrapins. So why are they still here? Well every other 5-3 team in the Big Ten lost last week. Also there’s far less shame in losing to Penn State than to say Illinois or Michigan State. It’s highly unlikely the run game will total -49 yards (not a typo) again. Maryland will have a chance to prove it deserves this slot this Saturday in Lincoln. If they can win the turnover battle the Terrapins should get back in the win column. 7. Nebraska (5-4 3-3 B1G) Last Ranking: 8 Last Result: 20-17 loss at Michigan State Next Game: versus Maryland This team would absolutely be 7-2 (and maybe even 8-1) if it had even average turnover luck. It’s the same old song for the Cornhuskers who now have a turnover margin of -12 on the season after committing three against Michigan State. The defense is improved but that doesn’t matter if the offense can’t stay on the field. Maryland has forced 13 turnovers on the year. If the Terps are able to force multiple in Lincoln look out. 8. Minnesota (5-4 3-3 B1G) Last Ranking: 7 Last Result: 27-26 loss versus Illinois Next Game: at Purdue It was a really tough loss by the Gophers who seemingly were beginning to enter a hot streak. However going 3-for-12 on third down and totaling just 167 passing yards would cool any team down. Thanks to the offense sputtering Minnesota couldn’t hold on to a second half lead and it is now firmly in the muddle of the Big Ten West. The Gophers should be able to provide themselves some distance though. This weekend hands them a Purdue team that lost four straight.  9. Illinois (4-5 2-4 B1G) Last Ranking: 10 Last Result: W 27-26 at Minnesota Next Game: versus Indiana Well the Illini might be back on track. That’s now three straight games with 20+ points and two of those ended in wins. Backup QB John Paddock led an 84-yard drive in the waning minutes to stun Minnesota and keep the hopes of a bowl game alive. Those hopes might get even stronger after this weekend. Illinois has a fairly weak Purdue team on deck and will look to stay hot as the temperatures stay cold. 10. Wisconsin (5-4 3-3 B1G) Last Ranking: 9 Last Result: 20-14 loss at Indiana Next Game: versus Northwestern What in the world is wrong with this offense? A team with Braelon Allen in the backfield should not be tied for 88th in scoring offense and it definitely shouldn’t lose to Indiana. But with no Allen and Tanner Mordecai long gone with injury the team completely sputtered against the Hoosiers. The Badgers will have another battle to deal with this weekend as a stingy Northwestern team comes to town. 11. Northwestern (4-5 2-4 B1G) Last Ranking: 10 Last Result: 10-7 loss versus Iowa Next Game: at Wisconsin The hopes for a bowl game are still alive. However the only way to do that is by out-mudballing the rest of the opponents on the docket this year. The offense remains incredibly inconsistent with this loss marking the second time in three games the Wildcats have failed to crack double digits.  However they are due for a decent showing offensively if current trends hold. If Northwestern can get back to form it may also be able to get back to .500. 12. Indiana (3-6 1-5 B1G) Last Ranking: 13 Last Result: 20-14 win versus Wisconsin Next Game: at Illinois A lot of streaks were snapped on Saturday: this was the Hoosiers’ first Big Ten win in their last seven conference games and their first home victory over Wisconsin since 2002. Indiana won the turnover battle 2-0 and also controlled possession providing a much-needed momentum boost for a season that was previously a struggle.  The next game up is going to be just as tough. Illinois appears to be finding its form but perhaps Indiana is as well. 13. Michigan State (3-6 1-5 B1G) Last Ranking: 14 Last Result: 20-17 win versus Nebraska Next Game: at Ohio State The Spartans finally have a win Harlon Barnett’s first in his interim role. This was the lowest yardage total Michigan State allowed since their matchup with Iowa all the way back in September. Thanks to stingy defense and some key turnovers Michigan State finally has some positive momentum. That positive momentum will likely come to a halt soon however. The Spartans have to travel to Columbus to take on the top-ranked team in the land. 14. Purdue (2-7 1-5 B1G) Last Ranking: 12 Last Result: 41-13 loss at Michigan Next Game: versus Minnesota That’s now four straight losses for the Boilermakers. Even worse all of the last three have been by 17 points or more. Hudson Card hasn’t broken 150 passing yards in the last three games either and the offense has been unable to find traction. Going back home for the first time in three weeks should provide some moral support but beating Minnesota will still be a tough task nonetheless.               \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Last weekend’s matchup against Iowa at Wrigley Field physically hurt to watch. Fans were forced to witness failed drive after failed drive by both teams as they combined for 17 total points — which the Chicago Cubs eclipsed twice during the 2023 MLB season. Players coaches and fans are ready to forget about Saturday’s ugly outing and look forward to the coming three weeks. Fortunately it is hard to perform worse on offense than Northwestern did on Saturday in an effort that culminated in just seven points on the board. NU will have to be at the top of its game for the rest of the year needing two victories over its next three matchups to definitively secure a bowl game. First up in the Wildcats’ quest for a postseason appearance is a much-anticipated matchup against Wisconsin in Madison. The game is winnable if everybody is at their best. However if the Wildcats play even remotely similarly to how they did last Saturday fans could be in for another rough game. Here are three reasons why Northwestern will defeat Wisconsin on Saturday along with three reasons why the Badgers will come out victorious. \nWhy Northwestern will beat Wisconsin\n Wisconsin’s got a case of the injury bug As it stands right now Wisconsin is set to be without two of its key contributors on offense. Quarterback Tanner Mordecai who underwent surgery to repair a broken hand he sustained against Iowa on Oct. 14 is currently listed as questionable ahead of Saturday’s matchup. The Badgers are desperately hoping to get him back after having to endure redshirt freshman Braedyn Locke over the last few games. Locke has barely eclipsed a 50% completion percentage over the three full games he’s played and the team is averaging just 15 points per game with him under center. Wisconsin could also be without star running back Braelon Allen. This season Allen has averaged nearly six yards per carry and his eight touchdowns have powered Wisconsin to the respectable record it has posted so far. Without Mordecai and Allen leading the Badgers’ offense UW could be in big trouble against Northwestern’s defense. Northwestern’s defense has been scary as of late Even if the Wildcats’ offense sputters against Wisconsin the defense has been quite effective as of late. Over the last four weeks opponents have put up 20 17 27 and 10 points respectively. Those point totals are low enough to keep the Wildcats in any game provided that the offense does its job too. A huge reason for Northwestern’s defensive renaissance has been defensive lineman Aidan Hubbard who earned Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week after his three-sack game against Maryland. Largely due to the efforts of Hubbard plus DL Jaylen Pate and LB Xander Mueller the front seven has become more formidable as the season has progressed. If he and the rest of the defense continues to play at a high level Northwestern may just come away with an upset on Saturday. The Badgers are on a very cold streak Wisconsin got off to a hot start this year winning four of its first five games and losing a close matchup to a talented Washington State team. Since then however things have gone south for the Badgers. They’ve lost three of their last four including a particularly ugly loss to Indiana last weekend not to mention a total offensive collapse against Iowa in which they only mustered six points. All the momentum is currently trending downward for Wisconsin. Though Northwestern is coming off its own brutal defeat to Iowa it has generally exceeded expectations this year and spirits are high among the team and fans alike. At 4-5 with three games to go NU is close to qualifying for its first bowl game since 2020. The general tone around the program is optimistic right now and combined with the downward spiral Wisconsin has found itself in over the last month the Wildcats may have the emotional advantage necessary to eke out a win. \nWhy Northwestern won’t beat Wisconsin\n Who the heck is under center for the ‘Cats? Northwestern’s quarterback situation right now is about as uncertain as it could possibly be. Ben Bryant’s status is still up in the air as he continues to nurse an upper body injury he sustained against Penn State. Bryant is theoretically the best quarterback on the roster when healthy. However he would undoubtedly be rusty as over a month has now passed since he last took the field. The other option is Brendan Sullivan who has taken over the reins for the past month. Sullivan showed flashes of excellence in an underdog victory over Maryland. Aside from that though he has otherwise been lackluster. Sullivan is not the ideal choice for this week but if Bryant’s injury continues to nag at him David Braun may not have a choice but to start his backup. The offensive line continues to sputter In what has been one of the main themes of this team all year Northwestern’s offensive line struggled once again at Wrigley. The unit allowed Sullivan to get sacked five times against Iowa whose defense ranks ninth in the Big Ten in terms of sacks. Wisconsin ranks sixth in that category which does not bode well for NU. Who ultimately plays quarterback for the Wildcats this weekend will not matter if the men in the trenches can’t give him ample time to get the ball out to Northwestern’s weapons who have performed well given the situation they’re in. Simply put the offensive line must be better or else fans could be in for another five-sack game in Madison. History does not favor the Wildcats Historically Northwestern vs Wisconsin has been a fairly one-sided rivalry. All time Wisconsin is 62-37-5 against the Wildcats. Additionally Northwestern has lost three of the last four matchups including 35-7 and 42-7 routs in 2021 and 2022 respectively. Last year in particular was a game to forget with Ryan Hilinski only completing 10 passes and throwing two interceptions before leaving the game due to injury and Sullivan making his collegiate debut. Now all of this is not to say that Northwestern will lose solely because it has lost in the past. However the general trend of Wisconsin dominance over the last few years combined with NU’s quarterback conundrum and issues with the offensive line is certainly something to be concerned about. There is a very real possibility of history repeating itself once again if Northwestern lacks stability in these areas. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story I assume most readers of this article haven’t watched collegiate fencing before let alone kept up with the tumult of the upset-heavy Division I jabbing scene. Consider this article your recommendation to start tuning in.  Men’s college basketball kicked off with no ranked teams squaring up on Monday night. A shocking JMU upset over No. 4 Michigan State made the night worth it. Two days prior the best fencing programs convened at the Western Invitational in a slate so packed with heavyweight programs I had to brainstorm how to fit all the action into a 500-word article (spoiler alert: this article ended up well over that threshold). After gearing up for the season with exhibitions at the Remenyik ROC/RJCC Penn State Open and the October NAC the ‘Cats laid the foundation for their season this weekend in Colorado Springs. On the Saturday docket for NU was a bout versus the event’s host No. 15 Air Force plus a battle against a good UC San Diego team a litmus test against No. 4 Harvard a duel against UNC and a faceoff versus Incarnate Word. That’s two top-20 teams in the span of a few hours. But get this: Sunday’s schedule included contests against Brandeis No. 3 Columbia and No. 14 Stanford. Seriously. For those keeping track that means NU slashed and jabbed four top-15 teams less than 48 hours into its season. Though the old adage tells you iron sharpens iron it doesn’t mitigate the sting of starting the season 5-3. Northwestern picked up wins where it was supposed to beating the four unranked squads (UC San Diego UNC Incarnate Word and Brandeis) but the purple unit managed only one win against the premier competition (No. 15 Air Force). In the second match of the season the ‘Cats claimed a decisive 21-6 victory against the Falcons. The sabres — a group that looks more and more formidable by the week as stars Megumi Oishi and Sky Miller have found complements in newcomers Adele Bois and Alex Chen — swept their Air Force adversaries 9-0. In the other ranked match of the day No. 4 Harvard handed NU its first loss of a season in a nail-biting back-and-forth 14-13 defeat. Despite the ‘Cats winning in the épée category 5-4 plus in the sabre division (yes this unit is going to be a problem for opponents this season) 6-3 a Crimson blowout to Northwestern’s foils ruined the upset attempt. The foils’ blades haven’t shined quite as hard as their counterparts so far this season and it’ll be worthwhile to watch how that group continues to contribute to team wins. On Sunday NU’s slate was even tougher. Although the ‘Cats entered the day with a 4-1 record back-to-back losses to ranked foes soured the weekend.  No. 3 Columbia had the Wildcats’ number throughout the contest winning in every category… Handily. A 9-0 sweep versus the épées was about as rocky a start as imaginable especially seeing as though some of Northwestern’s top-end talent resides in that division (see: Karen Wang). The Lions handled the foils and sabres both to the tune of 6-3 victories bringing the match tally to a dismal 21-6 count. For an NU team that finished last season vying for national acclaim such a lopsided defeat doesn’t particularly inspire hope in pundits who question whether the ‘Cats can break through this season. An even more disappointing loss and the last match of the Western Invitational came at the hands of No. 14 Stanford. Despite being ranked 11 slots lower than their Ivy League friends the Cardinals handed Northwestern a deflating 18-9 scoresheet. The foils once again fell victim to a blowout losing 1-8. The épées managed to win their category 6-3 backed by some veteran play while the sabres took a tough loss of their own 2-7. A 5-3 start is far from ideal for a Wildcat squad that finished last year’s campaign 43-13. Luckily the Colorado meet is about as tough a weekend as you’ll find in collegiate fencing. The ‘Cats have mostly individual exhibitions for the next few months offering a good chance to continue improving. Next up on the team front is a Nov. 19 matchup against unranked Ohio State at the Elite Invitational in Columbus. Look for the team to add one to the win column and pay especially close attention to how the foils bounce back from an uninspiring weekend. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Northwestern women’s tennis recently wrapped up the last of its fall tournament season capping off its run of five tournaments since September. The stretch started in South Bend Indiana with the Notre Dame Invitational followed by the ITA All-American Championships in Cary North Carolina.  Most recently the Wildcats came off of a doubles semifinal run by Christina Hand and Justine Leong in the ITA Midwest Regional Championships. The two sat at No. 26 in the ITA National Preseason Rankings in the doubles category. After beating DePaul to move to the semis the team narrowly fell to Michigan’s No. 4 doubles pairing of Kari Miller and Jaden Brown. The tough tandem provided a good fight but ultimately the Wolverines took off with the win. Just three weeks after the ITA Midwest Regional Championships the ‘Cats were off and running to the ITA National Fall Championships in San Diego. The squad was led again by Hand and Leong looking to recreate their success from East Lansing. The pair jumped out of the gate by winning two sets in a row against Denver to move into the Round of 16. Then in a two-set stunner once again against Michigan’s Miller and Brown they had a decisive victory that sent them to the quarterfinal round; finally the two Wildcats had the breakthrough against the two Wolverines that they had been looking for. But Leong and Hand ran out of steam and fell to Oklahoma State’s Auge Oby Kajuru and Anastasiya Komar in two sets.  Additionally Northwestern’s Kiley Rabjohns Sydney Pratt Maria Shusharina Britany Lau Autumn Rabjohns Jennifer Riester and Elisa Van Meeteren all competed this weekend in the Miami Fall Invitational in Coral Gables. The tournament saw two victories from Lau in singles against Georgia Tech and other singles victories from Riester and Autumn Rabjohns. The doubles pairings of Lau and Kiley Rabjohns racked up a victory against the Yellow Jackets on day two of the tournament following the win of Van Meeteren/Kiley Rabjohns the day before.  This fall the Wildcats have been able to realize a good amount of success. The doubles power team of Hand and Leong has continued its streak of wins against ranked opponents from last season having prevailed against No. 21 Vanderbilt (Jan. 22) and No. 17 Kansas (March 3). It’s clear they have what it takes to battle it out against skillful opponents. Although the ‘Cats are done for now they’ll be looking to come back strong when they compete against the FAU Owls on Jan. 15 from Boca Raton Florida.    \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After a seven-month hiatus Northwestern women’s basketball is finally back kicking off its 2023-24 season by taking on the UIC Flames tonight at 7 p.m. CT. In advance of the beginning of the regular season we asked our staffers to project what the Wildcats’ record will look like their team MVP breakout player and provide a bold prediction. Regular season record: 12-17 (5-13 B1G)  Big Ten finish: 11th MVP: Hailey Weaver Breakout player: Crystal Wang One bold prediction: Melannie Daley is Northwestern’s leading scorer I think that Northwestern improves from last year simply because there are so many members of its core from last year who are returning. Plus it’s almost a certainty that the team’s shooting numbers improve from last year. Considering how fast-paced Northwestern looks like it will play I think turnovers hinder the offense yet again and the ‘Cats play in arguably the toughest conference in the country. It’s also going to be difficult to be competitive in the Big Ten when NU only has one proven perimeter stopper in Hailey Weaver. I think the Wildcats are a year away but improvement should come from a ton of areas. David Gold Regular season record: 11-18 (4-14 B1G)  Big Ten finish: 12th MVP: Caileigh Walsh Breakout player: Maggie Pina One bold prediction:  Crystal Wang will make an All-Big Ten team After a horrid season last year I expect the ‘Cats to take a step forward in 2023-2024. Truthfully I don’t think it is possible to shoot worse than NU did last season finishing last in the Big Ten in both field goal percentage and three-point percentage. Joe McKeown brought in some scoring help with Maggie Pina and Crystal Wang and Caileigh Walsh should continue to develop as the predominant scorer for the Wildcats. Sydney Wood is tough to replace but Hailey Weaver should have an impressive season on the defensive side of the floor. Despite positive regression I just don’t think the ‘Cats have enough offensive talent to keep up with the juggernauts of the Big Ten. Northwestern will be better but still has ways to go before contending for a Big Ten title. Bradley Locker Regular season record: 10-19 (4-14 B1G) Big Ten finish: 12th MVP: Caroline Lau Breakout player: Crystal Wang One bold prediction: Eight players average 20+ minutes played On the heels of an incredibly disappointing 2022-23 season that featured only two conference victories you can get the sense that Joe McKeown is amped to rebound in a big way this year. On paper the Wildcats might be a comparable (if not slightly worse) roster minus mainstays Sydney Wood Courtney Shaw and Jillian Brown but I expect several players — notably Caroline Lau Hailey Weaver and Caileigh Walsh — to make considerable jumps. Plus some positive regression should go NU’s way. Collectively this group looks deep as its exhibition game displayed; don’t be surprised if Casey Harter and Wang become key figures as the season progresses. Still a developmental year of sorts in a very competitive Big Ten (what’s new) but some definitive signs of growth lead to more optimism. Regular season record: 13-16 (6-12 B1G)  Big Ten finish: 11th MVP: Caileigh Walsh Breakout player: Caroline Lau One bold prediction: Northwestern loses five Big Ten games by five or fewer points Although the ‘Cats lost Kaylah Rainey and Sydney Wood in the offseason an influx of guards has the squad deep in the backcourt. Defensively losing Wood hurts but Northwestern’s gritty style on that end will keep the ‘Cats competitive. Returning Walsh Mott and Lau while adding Maggie Pina and having Melanie Daley healthy should make this offense a lot stronger. Progress doesn’t come overnight but Northwestern should compete with the Big Ten’s middle-of-the-pack teams. After showing flashes at times last year watch for Lau to explode this season. She’s got incredible speed and shooting that ignited an occasionally lifeless offense a year ago. If she can take care of the ball in transition and make plays for her teammates Northwestern will find itself in a lot of close games. Natalie Wells Regular season record: 12-17 (4-14 B1G)  Big Ten finish: 12th MVP: Caileigh Walsh Breakout player: Melannie Daley One bold prediction: Caileigh Walsh averages at least 15 PPG The Wildcats enter the 2023-24 season having lost two of their top four leading scorers from last year: Sydney Wood and Jillian Brown. Wood graduated while Brown transferred to Virginia for a larger offensive role. The onus will be on Walsh to produce when the ‘Cats need a bucket and I anticipate that she’ll make waves in her junior season. The 6-foot-3 forward improved in every major statistical category last year and I think she’ll surpass 15 PPG as Northwestern’s first option. Daley will lead the bench unit after an injury limited her to just nine games in the 2022-23 season. Her midrange scoring and facilitating skills will be crucial when starting guards Caroline Lau and Hailey Weaver take a seat. I see the ‘Cats making marginal improvements on last year’s performance but it could be another rough season for Joe McKeown’s squad. Brendan Preisman Regular Season Record: 11-18 (5-13 B1G) Big Ten Finish: 12th MVP: Caroline Lau Breakout player: Melannie Daley One bold prediction: Northwestern puts three players in double figures It’s not going to be easy sledding this year but there should be some improvement. Northwestern had nine players play 20 or more minutes per game last season (10 if Daley who only played in nine games last year counts) and five (or six) of those players come back. With Courtney Shaw Sydney Wood and Jillian Brown gone the rebounding is probably going to take a hit but the outside shooting is likely to improve. I think the offense is going to be much more successful than its 63.7 points per game mark last year and Lau’s continuing experience and progression will be a big reason why. Daley started her first game since Jan. 20 2022 in the exhibition earlier this week and she looked very good leading the team in scoring with 18 points. While the losses in defense and size are going to limit the team’s ceiling the quicker pace will probably result in more offensive successes.  Dylan Friedland Regular Season Record: 12-17 (5-13 B1G) Big Ten Finish: 11th MVP: Caroline Lau Breakout player: Melannie Daley One bold prediction: Caroline Lau finishes in the top five in the Big Ten in assists For a team that lost multiple starters over the offseason Northwestern will have to do a lot in order to improve from a rough season last year. Caroline Lau getting an increased role on the team should help and NU will only go as far as she takes it. If she can make plays happen with the ball and distribute it effectively the ‘Cats will be better offensively than they were last season. Maggie Pina transferring in from Boston University should also help as she made 186 career threes at BU. She should be able to create more space for the rest of the team while improving the poor shooting from last year. Melannie Daley also looks ready to get back into action after scoring an impressive team-leading 18 points in the exhibition game. However the loss of Sydney Wood will really hurt Northwestern defensively. After being named to the Big Ten All-Defensive Team last season Joe McKeown’s team is going to struggle to replace her defense. I’m not sure if they have the offensive firepower to keep up in a strong Big Ten.      \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story ""Welcome back to the film room everybody. After pulling off the upset against Maryland NU traveled to the Friendly Confines to take on the Iowa Hawkeyes. It was a pitchers duel at Wrigley Field with the teams combining for 14 punts. At the end of the day Iowa eked out a 10-7 win on a last-second field goal."" This is going to be a shorter film review than normal because honestly there is just not much to talk about from this game. After a career day against the Terps Brendan Sullivan got the nod against Iowa. The ‘Cats’ gunslinger was unable to recreate his Halloweekend magic falling back down to earth against one of the best defenses in the nation. With the ‘Cats prepping for Wisconsin let’s take a look at the tape from Wrigley Field. The Stats After racking up over 300 yards against Maryland Sullivan’s numbers took a massive dip against the Hawkeyes. While he finished the game 12-for-20 he only threw for 81 yards and a touchdown. The Wildcats had five three-and-out drives and six drives where they didn’t move the ball 10 yards. The junior averaged a meager 4.1 yards per attempt his lowest this season. Despite the low numbers PFF awarded Sullivan a 71.4 passing grade. The ‘Cats’ gunslinger did have one big-time throw (pass with excellent ball location and timing generally thrown further down the field and/or into a tighter window) and no turnover-worthy plays. On the ground No. 6 added 38 yards on 10 carries. Although Sullivan was dropped five times NU’s offensive line was better than the previous weeks. The junior was pressured on only 37% of snaps at Wrigley Field the lowest rate since he took over the starting gig; however those pressures turned into four sacks.  Unlike previous weeks Sullivan did not push the ball down the field.  One-third of his completions were behind the line of scrimmage and he did not complete a single pass more than 20 yards downfield. Here is a breakdown of all of Sullivan’s tosses against Iowa. While the numbers do a great job of telling the story of the game the tape completes the tale. So without further ado let’s dive into the tape. The Good There was not a lot of good from the Friendly Confines but Sullivan did have some bright spots. While Sullivan did not do much with his arm he made plays with his legs throughout the game. His ability to run brings a new dynamic to the offense and it helped the ‘Cats remain in the contest. ""Just a good old-fashioned zone read. Sullivan sees the edge defender crash inside and pulls the ball for an easy first down. Zone read only works if the defense respects the quarterbacks ability to run the ball and Sullivan forces Iowa to make a choice. It is simple but it is encouraging to see him make the correct decision and pick up a first down something he did not do consistently in 2022."" This made me smile. My biggest criticism of Sullivan has always been his pocket presence or really the lack of it. In 2022 and the beginning of 2023 he had a tendency to bail out of the pocket backward and cause big losses; now he is stepping up. You can see his internal clock ticking and instead of going the wrong direction he exits through the front of the pocket and runs. He picks up seven yards because his pocket presence has taken tremendous strides this season. It’s not a big play but another encouraging sign of development from the signal caller. The Bad Like the good there was not a lot of bad from Sullivan. However there were some mistakes that he needs to clean up. Although the ‘Cats’ offense struggled holistically there were multiple times when Northwestern had a chance to convert on third down but Sullivan missed the throw. This was a momentum-shifting play for NU. The ‘Cats had finally strung together a drive and had a third-and-manageable. Cam Johnson is open on a stop route but Sullivan puts it too low and Johnson cannot corral the ball. This is a clean pocket so there is no reason this ball shouldn’t have hit Johnson in the numbers. This is a throw a Big Ten quarterback has to make and it probably cost NU its first points of the game. Once again this is a throw Sullivan has to make. Even though it is third-and-long Mike Bajakian dials up a play that was good enough for the first down. Johnson beats the corner on an out route but No. 6 sails it out of bounds. This is a clean pocket and his footwork is good but Sullivan short-arms the throw. Facing Big Ten defenses there are only going to be a few times a game where a receiver has good separation. It’s on the QB to get the ball to his target and Sullivan came up short multiple times on Saturday. Final thoughts This game taught me nothing about Sullivan as a quarterback. He has improved since stepping in for Ben Bryant but he still has things to clean up. With David Braun saying Ben Bryant is day-to-day this may be the end of Sullivan’s time under center. If this is the last we see of him in 2023 he has earned a chance to compete for the starting gig in 2024. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story On an overcast day at Lakeside Field the largest shadow wasn’t cast by a cloud. It was cast by the Northwestern defense. The Wildcats smothered their Round of 16 opponent Miami (Ohio) in a dominant 3-0 victory. Northwestern totaled 15 shots compared to just six for the RedHawks. Of those shots for the Wildcats 10 were on goal.  The scorers for the ‘Cats were Lauren Wadas Ilse Tromp and Olivia Bent-Cole. Annabel Skubisz was reduced to a spectator for much of the match thanks to the defensive dominance but did make a key save on the only shot she faced. Miami which was 36th nationally in goals per game heading into the contest was shut out for just the fourth time all season. In a battle between two teams boasting lots of offensive firepower the defenses ruled the day to start. The early going was marred with giveaways and both teams spent the vast majority of the first quarter in the midfield. Northwestern probed the goal area several times and had a few promising attacks (including one where a RedHawk defender lost her stick) but was unable to put up a shot in the first 10 minutes. That drought wouldn’t last for much longer. After some beautiful passing Alia Marshall was able to sneak past the defense and fire a shot from the right side 11 minutes into the game. Unfortunately for Marshall there was too much traffic and her shot was blocked. The Wildcats second nationally in penalty corners per game earned their first with just under a minute remaining in the frame. With Marshall setting up it was simply too easy for the ‘Cats offense. Peyton Halsey left the ball for Wadas the senior who fired the ball right into the back of the boards to give Northwestern a 1-0 lead. It was her seventh goal of the season showing off the defending NCAA All-Tournament Team member’s clutch postseason chops. ""The second quarter was more of the same. Neither team was able to do much offensively until Tracey Fuchs’ squad earned its second penalty corner of the game less than four minutes into the frame. Two minutes later Northwestern had an opportunity with a three-on-two advantage but couldnt connect on the pass."" With just over five minutes to go in the first half Lindsey Frank earned a takeaway in the offensive end and was able to slice through the RedHawks defense all the way into the circle. Frank’s shot was blocked but only after the defender fell to the ground and laid out in front of it. With a one-goal lead Northwestern’s pressure somehow jumped up even another level and Miami struggled to push the ball past midfield let alone into the shooting circle.  Tromp did commit a potentially costly turnover with two minutes to play but redeemed herself by stripping the Miami player of the ball almost immediately. The play was pretty representative of the first half as a whole: Miami almost never had any opportunities and even when it did Northwestern snuffed them out immediately. The shot total and the end of the half was 5-0 and NU’s 1-0 lead felt much larger.  Less than three minutes into the second half Bent-Cole went on one of her trademark one-woman fastbreaks. It led to a penalty corner and while Wadas’ shot was blocked Northwestern earned another corner. The ‘Cats once again came up empty though as Tromp’s powerful shot rocketed off the crossbar.  The failure to capitalize seemed to give the RedHawks a boost. After over 35 fruitless minutes they finally earned a penalty corner. Madison Workman put the ball into play but the shot by Paula Pena Martinez was denied by Annabel Skubisz the Big Ten Goalkeeper of the Year. Skubisz’s save smothered the Miami momentum and while Pena Martinez did earn another shot a minute later it was blocked.  The Wildcats earned their fifth penalty corner of the afternoon with under three minutes to play in the third quarter. Marshall set up once more and this time the ball went to Tromp again. This time she did not hit the crossbar. Tromp fired the shot low and to the left and all RedHawks goalkeeper Isabelle Perese could do was flail helplessly as the ball went by. With under 20 minutes to play Northwestern had doubled its lead to 2-0.  Miami wouldn’t go quietly however The RedHawks earned a penalty corner of their own less than a minute later but the shot by Claudia Negrete Garcia went wide of the goal. Miami couldn’t bring the deficit back to a single goal and Northwestern would quickly take advantage of the rapidly shifting momentum. Bent-Cole once again took the ball and knifed right through the RedHawks defense. She finished the play off with a powerful shot up high while moving across the goal and the ball once again ended up in the back of Miami’s net. With the third quarter coming to a close Northwestern had put up three goals while keeping the shutout alive. The ‘Cats continued to put their foot on the gas in the fourth quarter. The team earned two penalty corners in the first three minutes of the final frame but Perese was able to deny both Wadas and Tromp. She was able to garner an even more impressive save about three minutes later when she was able to stymie a wide-open Halsey who had leaked behind the defense.  With half the fourth quarter gone Northwestern had their best break of the day. Regan Cornelius delivered a beautiful pass to Wadas who passed to Bent-Cole who gave it back to Wadas. The chase was on for the RedHawks who only stopped the attack by tripping Wadas up inside the circle. However the call on the field was overturned and Miami would retake possession.  The visitors would parlay that possession into a penalty corner but were once again turned back by a stifling Northwestern defense. The first shot by Negrete Garcia was blocked and the second went wide of the boards by a significant margin. Of the Redhawks’ six shots in the game just one was on goal.  Miami would manage another shot over a minute later but it was once again wide and saved by Wildcat defender Katie Jones. From there Northwestern would just run the game out completing a masterpiece of a game with a 3-0 opening round win. They nearly made it 4-0 after Halsey broke past the defense again but Perese made two massive saves making the margin of victory look slightly more palatable. The game was the 13th on the season that the ‘Cats won by multiple goals. Northwestern will face off against No. 10 Louisville the one team it has lost to this season in the NCAA Quarterfinals on Sunday afternoon at 1 p.m. CT.

Share this story In its season opener Northwestern took on UIC in a battle of Illinois schools at Welsh Ryan Arena. It was a tight game; UIC even led 44-30 at half. But the ‘Cats managed to eke out the W by a score of 92-86 handing UIC its first loss of the young season. Here’s three takeaways from the first ‘Cats’ contest of the year: Paige Mott is both a leader a rebounding machine The senior out of Philadelphia was a strong player for Northwestern in 2022-23 and she started off this season with a bang. Mott dropped 13 points on 50% shooting and she had 20 boards. 20! For reference Mott averaged four rebounds per contest last season.  Against UIC Mott’s rebounds were leading to extra possessions putback attempts and defensive stands that helped Northwestern climb back into the contest and eventually into the lead. One of them led to a huge bucket late in the game when she grabbed an offensive board that led to an and-one after she went back up with it through contact. The basket gave the ‘Cats a one point lead. Going into the season it was clear that Mott would be a critical offensive player for Northwestern as well as one of its senior leaders. But if she’s going to be this impactful in other areas of the game as well the ‘Cats will be very pleased. Melannie Daley has taken a step or two or three This is Daley’s third season in a Northwestern uniform and she’s never before averaged more than 6.5 points. That was in her freshman year. Last season as a sophomore Daley was limited to just nine games and averaged only 4.6 points per game and less than one rebound and assist per night. It was a whole different story for her in the first game of her third year against UIC. Daley was a dominant force pouring in 25 points on 12-of-21 shooting. If we’re being picky sure she could have been more efficient. But if Northwestern is going to get that kind of offensive production from Daley then it’s hard to complain. She’s not much of a threat from beyond the arc and she’s not bringing a ton of other things to the table offensively but clearly she has a nose for the basket.  Daley played 41 minutes in the contest. It was right in line with what Mott Caileigh Walsh and Caroline Lau played. She’s going to be a staple in this starting lineup and Northwestern will hope she can replicate the success she had against UIC putting points on the board. That is after all the simplest way to win basketball games. The ‘Cats have to improve defensively Giving up 86 points at home to a non-conference foe is not ideal especially when that non-conference foe only put up 67 points in its first game at Loyola Chicago. Granted it was the ‘Cats’ first game and it also went into overtime. But even if you take away the OT period Northwestern still allowed 75. If the defense looks like it did come Big Ten play things are going to be bleak. The ‘Cats allowed two of UICs taller guards Keke Rimmer and Dais’Ja Trotter to each score 22 points. It didn’t inspire confidence in Northwestern’s ability to handle bigger players who can also shoot the basketball. In the third quarter Northwestern settled things down only allowing eight points in the frame. The ‘Cats will hope to find that form on the defensive side of the floor again in their next game a daytime battle at home against Omaha on Sunday. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story If anyone were told that Wisconsin in the first year of Luke Fickell and OC Phil Longo would have a better record by just one game in November than Northwestern nobody could have possibly comprehended it. But that’s the present reality for two Big Ten West teams that have shown promise yet inconsistencies. Before the Wildcats do battle with the Badgers from Camp Randall Stadium learn more about NU’s away opponent courtesy of WSUM Sports’ Krissy Birdsall. Inside NU: The Badgers are 5-4 but haven’t felt like the dominant team we anticipated. Aside from injuries what’s gone awry from a schematic standpoint? Krissy Birdsall: At least with those last two losses especially the one against Indiana I think that the injuries were maybe the first time that we really saw them play a factor into the game. But outside of that I think that just bringing an entirely new system an entire new coaching staff a bunch of transfer players coming in it took a little bit longer for that development and the transition from one head coach to another that run completely different schemes. I think that Wisconsin was able to kind of start finding its stride at least through the early part of October but after the injury to [Tanner] Mordecai — who’s your starting quarterback — and bringing in a quarterback [Braedyn Locke] that’s never played at the Division I level. Was at Mississippi State last year; didn’t play. He comes in as a transfer; he sees the field for the first time. You’re going to hit those bumps in the road. Then obviously the injuries to Chez [Mellusi] and Braelon [Allen] and Chimere Dike don’t help either because you really just lost the bread and butter of your offense. INU: In your opinion what went wrong against Indiana and can the ship be turned around? KB: I think one thing that the Badgers have struggled with the entire year was getting off to a fast start. This has been a problem since the first game of the season. They struggled against Buffalo in the first half; they were down 24-9 at the Washington State game and they had really struggled in the first half. Georgia Southern they were up I think 13-10 but it really shouldn’t have been that; they actually should have been tied. A couple of the other games they really struggled in the first half so Indiana took full advantage of that in the first half. They were able to get up to an early lead. Wisconsin usually in the second half having Tanner Mordecai in the back there — really good at saving comebacks. Yeah they were able to stage to come back against Illinois but it’s Illinois defense. I think that’s a factor too. So I think Indiana was just able to catch Wisconsin off guard and they weren’t really able to respond in the second half like they’ve normally been able to. Whether that has to do with the injuries or just not being able to click together that’s up for discussion. But yeah Indiana definitely got the better of Wisconsin in that one. INU: The injuries are front and center to Wisconsin’s offense. Do you expect Mordecai Allen or Dike to play against Northwestern this Saturday? KB: They haven’t released anything official. Mordecai was dressed for the first game for against Indiana; he was taking some pregame snaps but he wasn’t able to obviously see the field. I don’t expect him to play. Braelon Allen and Chimere Dike are definitely more likely to play. Allen was listed as questionable; he didn’t even dress. He’s dealing with a sprained ankle injury so that could be one of those they can come back in two weeks they can come back in four weeks. Chimere Dike had a knee injury and it seemed like he was able to do some pregame warmups but wasn’t fully ready to go. I mean I would probably say in terms of who’s going to come back the most likely would be Allen or Chimere Dike but I’m not fully expecting either of those guys to be 100%. INU: The Badgers have quietly put together another really strong defensive season despite losing several key pieces. Which playmakers have stepped up for Mike Tressel’s unit? KB: Wisconsin’s defense definitely took a little bit to get going over those first couple of games. But in the last game and especially that Ohio State game I thought were their two best performances of the year. If you’re gonna talk about players specifically S Hunter Wohler was one of the guys that was tabbed as one of the preseason stars of this defense and he has basically led the team in tackles in nearly every single game. LB C.J. Goetz has taken a really step up over the last three games. He’s done a really great job filling in for the defense and kind of spinning into that Mike Tressel system as a linebacker. Wisconsin has had great linebackers over the last couple of years so he’s really filling in that position as well. And then Ricardo Hallman which is probably one of my favorite players to watch just in that cornerback position. He was pretty lockdown on Marvin Harrison Jr. Any time that they went 1-on-1 he was able to almost always shut him down. I think he only gave up one pass to Marvin Harrison Jr. which was really big for him; it was kind of his first time showing his talent on the national stage. He’s gonna be one of those players to watch throughout the rest of the season and the rest of his time at Wisconsin. INU: What would you say the overall mood is surrounding the program as we approach the 10th game of the Fickell Era? KB: If you want to look back all the way in August there were a lot of people who completely thought that this team was going to win 10 games — not only because of the new system and the new players and the playmakers that were coming in but just the way that the schedule was too. I mean you look at Indiana game even coming into the game despite not having Braelon Allen [the Badgers] were favored. Everybody thought that that was going to be a for sure win; that didn’t happen. So Northwestern I think everyone’s going to be a little bit more cautious about these last three games that originally back in August everyone said that these were easy wins for the Badgers. I think at this point though in terms of the rest of the season you need a lot of help to win the West. Wisconsin is going to have to win out and you need Iowa to lose two games. So I feel like a lot of people are kind of throwing that out at this point just because it seems like you really need to hope for Iowa to do wrong. But at the end of the day I think just trying to finish off strongly and get a decent bowl game is really where Wisconsin fans are looking. INU: What’s your score prediction for Saturday and why? KB: Well the one good thing about this game against Northwestern is it’s not at Ryan Field. Wisconsin has typically struggled at Ryan Field but they did well last year at Ryan Field and that was all during the time of Paul Chryst was fired Jim Leonhard was taking over as the head coach. Kind of in a similar situation although they’re coming back in Camp Randall. They’re in need of a bounce-back game; they’re in need of this team getting together and rallying at the end of the season. I think just the way that the schedule lines up and the mindset that Wisconsin has going into it I think they’ll be able to pull away with the victory. I don’t think it’s going to be an easy or very pretty victory. I was thinking somewhere along 17-10 [Wisconsin]. So low-scoring but it’ll be interesting. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Colder weather indicates a move to indoor sports. Northwestern wrestling has reached new heights in recent seasons but with Lucas Davison Michael DeAugustino and Chris Cannon transferring to Michigan for their graduate seasons the Wildcats will have their work cut out for them. Here’s a preview of what to expect.  2022-23 Season Recap In its first season without 2022 NCAA champion Ryan Deakin Northwestern performed fairly well. The squad went 7-3 (5-3 B1G) picking up wins against No. 13 Wisconsin and No. 23 Rutgers while only falling to No. 2 Iowa No. 4 Ohio State and No. 16 Nebraska.   ""The ‘Cats got off to a fast start finishing 10th in a field of 30 at the Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invitational and winning the programs first-ever Ken Kraft Midlands Championship. The CKLV was highlighted by five podium finishes with Lucas Davison in second place Yahya Thomas in third Trevor Chumbley and Troy Fisher in fifth and Cannon in eighth. "" Lucas Davison Chumbley and Thomas all claimed individual titles while Cannon clocked in at second Andrew Davison at third Aiden Vandenbush at seventh and Evan Bates at eighth at Midlands.  Beyond the postseason NU performed solidly with a seventh-place finish at the Big Ten Championship that featured seven top-six podium fishes with DeAugstino Cannon and Chumbley all achieving upsets en route to a fourth-place finish. The bouts also secured eight automatic bids into the NCAA Championships for DeAugustino Cannon Thomas Chumbley Frankie Tal-Shahar Maxx Mayfield and Andrew and Lucas Davison.  The Wildcats finished in 25th — their worst finish in the Tournament since the 2016-2017 season. The underwhelming performance; however should not overshadow a strong season or the fifth-place finish from Lucas Davison who had just earned All-American honors for the second time in his career.  2023-24 Season Preview  With notable losses from the program’s biggest names the squad has a learning curve in front of itt. Head coach Matt Stoniolo is going to need some wrestlers to step up and here are a few bound to be getting some time on the mats.  157 — Trevor Chumbley  The redshirt senior will likely be one of the most significant wrestlers for NU. Last season was his first as a starter and he took on that role well with a 27-9 record. He had podium finishes in the CKLV and Midlands (the first Wildcat 157-pounder to take home the title since 2012) and won a pair of matches in NCAA’s. If he lives up to expectations Chumbley is in for a successful year.  174 — Troy Fisher Fisher proved his talent in an impressive junior season. The redshirt finished fifth at CKLV garnered two wins before exiting due to an injury at Midlands and entered NCAA as the No. 19 seed which he opened with an upset victory. The senior will look to grow off his 20-8 record and be another anchor of the lineup.  141 — Frankie Tal-Shahar  Another well-known name on this lineup the junior is looking to place at the NCAA Championships where he lost in the third consolation round after two wins. He put together a strong end to his regular season winning his last seven bouts and continuing that success with a fifth-place finish in the Big Ten Championship.  165 — Maxx Mayfield His redshirt sophomore season was his first as a Northwestern starter. Mayfield put up an impressive season going 25-13 and earning a No. 18 seed at the NCAA Championships a fifth-place finish at Big Tens and three wins in the Midlands. Mayfield’s junior year could be a momentous one. 184 — Evan Bates The redshirt sophomore is currently listed at 197 pounds but he made the switch to wrestling in the 184-pound decision last year where he posted a 19-18 record with seven major decision victories. They included a major decision victory to place eighth at Midlands and a decision victory during the Big Ten Championship. 157 — Aiden Vandenbush  As a redshirt first year Vandebush won five straight matches in the consolation bracket to earn a seventh-place finish at Midlands and posted a 16-8 record overall.  165 — David Ferrante  In his first two seasons Ferrante made it to the NCAA and the Big Ten Championships. The highlight was a fifth-place finish at Big Tens in 2021-2022. Last year Ferrante only had eight appearances due to an injury but his senior season offers the opportunity for him to reach his full potential.  Outlook Losing three All-Americans to a Big Ten foe is far from ideal and creates a gaping hope for this squad. Additionally Thomas and Andrew Davison who did the opposite of his brother by transferring to NU from Michigan for graduate school are gone. The ‘Cats are very clearly absent of their most prominent wrestlers who faired well last season. To be frank this season may be about rebuilding and training younger wrestlers but Chumbley Fisher and Tal-Sharar are ones to watch as they are capable of amassing great individual success.  Northwestern opens its season on Sunday in the Michigan State Open.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story 1092 days later the streak is over! Yes Northwestern won a game last season in Ireland which is not Ryan Field but that was a neutral-site game deemed a home win for the ‘Cats. This means that for the first time since 2020 against Purdue Northwestern has won an away game thanks to a 24-10 victory in Madison against the Badgers Stock Up Ben Bryant In his first game back from a four-game injury absence Ben Bryant looked like he hadn’t skipped a beat. The Cincinnati transfer led the ‘Cats on four consecutive scoring drives to start the game as Northwestern pounced to a 24-3 halftime lead without ever punting the ball away. Bryant finished the day with three touchdowns two coming in the air and another on the ground. He finished the day with 195 passing yards completing 69% of his passes. Throughout Bryant looked poised quickly identifying blitzing Badgers and slicing up the defense while completing passes to seven different receivers. The signal-caller showed glimpses of it in the second half of the Minnesota game but this performance was the exact type of spark NU envisioned when it brought Bryant in via the transfer portal. Third-down offense  Coaches will tell you games are won and lost on third down. And you can’t do much better than Northwestern did on money downs in the first half. A week after going 6-of-17 on third downs the Wildcats converted each of their first 10 first downs. Ten! In the air or on the ground there was nothing the Badger defense could do to stymie this offensive attack. And these weren’t third-and-one gimmes that could be easily converted — Northwestern’s average third-down distance to go in the first half was 5.9 yards. The first failed conversion came with just over a minute to go in the first half when the ‘Cats couldn’t punch the ball in on a third-and-goal from the 13-yard line. Even with the miss Northwestern was able to tack on another three points thanks to Jack Olsen’s leg. Bend-but-don’t-break defense The score at halftime was 24-3. The final score? 24-10 only due to a garbage time touchdown with under 15 seconds on the game clock. Northwestern’s offense went completely silent in the second half but the defense picked up the slack. After a great first half featuring a red zone stand and a missed field goal the Northwestern D flexed its muscle for the second consecutive game. Despite strong Wisconsin field position Northwestern’s defense in the second half forced two punts a crucial turnover on downs in the red zone and a fumble. Late in the season the defense is really rounding into form and playing some of its best ball led by the back-seven. Despite a middling pass rush Northwestern has remedied most of its early-season tackling issues and the secondary has continued to give offenses problems. In the last eight quarters the defense has only given up 20 points against the two teams most pundits projected to be the class of the Big Ten West. Honorable Mentions: Run defense fast starts the loss-win-loss-win alternating pattern Jump Around Stock Down The field position game The NU defense made several clutch stops during the game but the special teams did no favors for Northwestern in terms of field position today. The average starting field position for the ‘Cats was at their own 20 including one drive that started at the 10 and two that began at Northwestern’s eight. Meanwhile Wisconsin’s average drive started at the 34 including possessions that kicked off at the 37 42 49 and Northwestern 48. Some of these were a result of poor Northwestern positioning on punts but there were also several instances of shallow kickoffs that allowed for deep Badger returns. It’s fortunate that this statistical disparity did not show up in the final score but it’s worth monitoring going forward. Luke Fickell It turns out that the AAC ain’t the Big Ten. The three-time AAC Coach of the Year was one of the biggest pickups for any team this offseason. The Badgers swiftly signed Fickell to a seven-year $54.6 million contract. While it wasn’t reasonable to expect Ben Bryant’s former coach to take Wisconsin to the College Football Playoff in his first year I do think it’s fair to qualify this season as a disappointment.  In a season where the Big Ten West was wide open for anyone’s taking Wisconsin suffered an October loss to Iowa the team that looks to be the clear favorite to represent the division in Indianapolis. Despite the loss Wisconsin was still very much in the mix. But the past two weeks effectively sealed the nail in the coffin with last week’s brutal 20-14 loss to Indiana who hadn’t won a conference matchup before that game and Northwestern a team the Badgers beat by 35 points a season ago. Bowl eligibility is still likely for Fickell’s squad but the team failed to capitalize on this window of the Big Ten divisional structure an opportunity that will no longer be available when four new teams join the Big Ten next fall. The Northwestern-Wisconsin rivalry When the new scheduling model came out to accommodate the four new teams in the Big Ten I was disappointed to see that Wisconsin was not on Northwestern’s list of protected rivals. With Northwestern’s 14-point victory on Saturday it marks the eighth consecutive matchup between the Badgers and Wildcats to end without a one-score game. Only two games since 2010 have finished as tight contests. It will be odd to not play Wisconsin on an annual basis but if the on-field product continues to be so poor maybe it’s for the best.

Share this story MADISON Wisc. — Northwestern football may never win or lose two games in a row under David Braun but it’s already hit the five-win threshold. After scoring only seven points at Wrigley Field last Saturday the Wildcats (5-5 3-4 B1G) saw their offense on the gas pedal the whole first half from Camp Randall Stadium beating Wisconsin (5-5 3-4 B1G) 24-10. In his first time playing since Sept. 30 Ben Bryant fueled a hyper-efficient operation going 18-for-26 with 195 yards three total touchdowns and a 157.6 rating. On the ground Cam Porter added 72 yards on 18 carries. Collectively the ‘Cats totaled 319 yards 5.3 yards per play and were 11-for-16 on third down but the team had only 25 yards in the second half. For Wisconsin Tanner Mordecai went 31-for-45 for 255 passing yards and a fumble lost in his return. Will Pauling led the way for the Badgers’ receiving corps with 10 catches for 96 yards but Braelon Allen had just four touches for 11 yards. As the Badgers took the field for the first time it marked the return of Mordecai Allen and Chimere Dike — and that star power got to work. After a five-yard pass from Mordecai to Riley Nowakowski the UW starter hooked up with Will Pauling to move the chains on third. On the following play Phil Longo dialed up a play-action shot where Mordecai found Vinny Anthony II for 35 yards. Allen then gained 10 yards himself on a catch followed by a run but Kenny Soares II tripped up Mordecai on a third-down scramble from the Northwestern 15. NU bent but didn’t break as Nathanial Vakos made a field goal from 33 yards out. Then Bryant returned to action for the Wildcats. No. 2 connected with Bryce Kirtz on a sprintout for six yards but the receiver next dropped a deep out. On third-and-4 Bryant hit Ray Niro II who broke a tackle to gain 12 yards. A five-yard curl by Cam Johnson and two-yard carry by Cam Porter set up third-and-2 where Porter surged up the gut for a gain of 17. Mike Bajakian got creative with a screen to Joseph Himon II and jet sweep to A.J. Henning and Bryant tossed to Kirtz to get the first down. The ‘Cats faced another third down having surpassed five minutes on their first drive and NU answered by locating Henning wide open for a touchdown. It was 7-3 Northwestern with 4:12 to play subsequent to the 12-play 79-yard drive. Following the marathon possession the Wildcats held Allen to no gain on first and Garnett Hollis Jr. knocked a third-down pass away from Bryson Green. On the ensuing possession Porter squirted through the hole for six on second and Bryant found Johnson over the middle to gain a first down. Porter continued running with a head of steam collecting 13 and five yards while a facemask on an Anthony Tyus III run put the ball at the Badgers’ 17. In the red zone Kirtz caught a late out route for five but a Henning sweep was stuffed. Not to fear because Porter picked up the first. Two plays later Bryant scampered in on a play fake and it was 14-3 Wildcats. The Badgers got a surge of momentum courtesy of a 25-yard return from Anthony and kept going from there. C.J. Williams was left wide open on the near side on second down and gained 10. Cade Yacamelli ran for two and netted four on a dump-off and on third-and-4 an excellent open-field tackle by Jaheem Joseph cut down Hayden Rucci. Luke Fickell punted on fourth-and-3 from the Northwestern 42 leaving the Surrender Index displeased. The offensive explosion continued in the form of Himon who raced down the far sideline for a 32-yard trot. NU went back to No. 20 who escaped multiple Badgers for as impressive of a five-yard carry as you’ll see. Bryant threw it a hair too far for Kirtz on second but was then on the money to Henning for a first down. After throwing it away on first Bryant kept his eyes downfield to find Niro for 19 yards. Porter amassed four yards on two carries but the Wisconsin defense faltered again: Bryant threw a beautiful fade to Johnson who came down with it in the end zone. It was 21-3 Northwestern with 6:41 to go in the first half. Another Henry Helms kick went short giving Wisconsin the ball at its own 42. Mordecai and Pauling got another major gain with the transfer picking up 33 yards against Rod Heard II. Pauling dropped the subsequent target and a three-yard completion to Anthony set up third-and-7 at the Northwestern 22 — but Mordecai overthrew Dike. It went from bad to worse for the Badgers as Vakos missed the 40-yard kick. Starting on its 22 Bryant looked deep downfield to Henning who made a circus catch with one hand at the Wisconsin 37. Porter kept up his angry running by getting four but Jack Lausch got decked on a QB Sweep. On third down from the UW 32-yard line Bajakian put Henning in the backfield and No. 8 danced along the sideline to pick up the necessary yardage. Bryant was nearly intercepted by Jason Maitre on first but a 12-yard screen to Marshall Lang got enough to keep the ball with NU. An illegal shift backed the pigskin to the UW 13 and Bryant was errant on two straight passes to Kirtz. The NU starter scrambled for three on third down but was well short of the end zone. The ‘Cats came away with points when Jack Olsen sank a 28-yard field goal. With 61 seconds left in the half Mordecai hit Bryson Green and Pauling for pickups of seven and eight respectively. but UW stalled after a Najee Story trip-up of Mordecai and a drop on third. Northwestern knelt to close out the half up 24-3 having amassed 294 yards of offense and going a pristine 10-for-10 on third down. The second half offensive regression began quickly. Porter was stuffed on his first carry of the third and Bryant dropped a snap but fell on it. On third-and-16 the Wildcats’ QB was sacked by Christian Alliegro. Hunter Renner was forced to punt for the first time and his boot went only 35 yards. UW started on the Northwestern 48. On the ensuing Badger possession Mordecai had time on third but found Pauling late to convert on third-and-8. The tandem reconnected for nine on first down but a hold on Jack Nelson pushed the ball back to the NU 39. Yacamelli muscled his way for six on second and on third-and-5 a draw from Mordecai picked up 19. A false start on second down pushed the rock back to the 17 but Anthony tapped his toes for an 11-yard catch. On third down backed up in its goal line Soares batted down a would-be touchdown pass. Then on fourth-and-4 from the Northwestern 8 Morcedai’s pass went off the hands of Anthony and the Badgers came up empty. Despite the stop Northwestern’s offense was stuck in neutral again. The Wildcats went three-and-out and Renner’s punt checked up at the Wisconsin 49. Yet UW couldn’t muster anything offensively. A second-down hold turned into a third-and-9 where Aidan Hubbard wrapped up Mordecai for a loss of 10 — his fifth sack in three weeks. Tyus kickstarted Northwestern’s next possession with a five-yard gain but Hunter Wohler met him in the backfield on second down. Third-and-6 displayed a strong pitch and catch between Bryant and Johnson who narrowly was in front of the marker. The two worked over the middle for eight two plays later. As the third quarter came to an end neither team got on the board and Northwestern maintained a 21-point lead — still not enough to discourage Jump Around though. Following the frenzy Bryant was off to Kirtz and Renner punted to the Wisconsin 22. Longo’s offense stayed in hibernation on the next drive with Sean McLaughlin batting down a pass on first. Jackson Aker picked up a third-and-1 and collected seven on a flip from Mordecai. The Badger QB found Skyler Bell to put the ball at the Northwestern 42 with 11:30 left. On a scramble up the middle Heard knocked it away from Mordecai for a fumble lost and Fickell’s team still couldn’t find the end zone. The ‘Cats went three-and-out on the next drive with Maitre knocking a pass away from Henning. Despite marching into Northwestern territory Mordecai overshot Pauling on third-and-17 and Fickell elected to punt with 6:37 remaining. Ultimately Wisconsin finally found paydirt with an Aker touchdown with 11 seconds left. Yet Northwestern came away with a 24-10 victory — its first triumph in Madison since 2015.

Share this story With nine minutes to go Northwestern was on the ropes in more ways than one.  Boo Buie had just picked up his fourth foul which meant the Wildcats would lose their team captain and offensive centerpiece for a few crucial minutes. The foul sent Dayton’s Nate Santos to the line with a chance to break a 50-50 tie and give the lead back to the Flyers who were a few minutes removed from answering Northwestern’s half-ending 11-0 run with an 11-point stretch of their own. Dayton’s ball movement out of the post and its three-point shooting were the driving factors behind that comeback. It wasn’t a moment of total desperation and Northwestern had rolled with the punches and thrown some of its own on both ends. You just didn’t know. You didn’t know who would respond to the absence of an All-Big Ten point guard and emotional leader for an extended period down the stretch. You didn’t know if a pre-Thanksgiving game that sounded more like Lake Michigan’s February wind whipping an emotional pendulum back-and-forth was the best place to grow and take formative baby steps toward adopting a season-long identity.  But most of all you didn’t know if Northwestern could stray from the blueprint and still win against a quality opponent. Northwestern’s 2022-23 season surprised everyone to the point where one could reflect and say: “I’ve seen it all. No way will this team shock me more than that.” With the ‘Cats mostly running it back it was pretty easy to define the surprises as certainties.  Northwestern’s success starts and ends with Boo Buie. Northwestern’s going to double the post often and it’ll win by forcing turnovers. Northwestern stuck to a blueprint last year and it needs to do so again. Yet the only certainty so far is that Northwestern still hasn’t run out of surprises. On the second possession after Buie checked out Brooks Barnhizer threw out a flurry of moves in the high post. He picked up his dribble with eight seconds left in the shot clock and for a moment it looked like the ‘Cats would put up a sloppy possession. Instead the junior pump-faked created space and rose up for a one-legged go-ahead fadeaway jumper.  After struggling to finish inside against a smaller Binghamton frontcourt on Monday Barnhizer consistently nailed difficult shots like that one against Dayton’s taller forwards no matter how tightly they defended him. Less than a minute after Nick Martinelli who came off a minutes restriction against Binghamton due to a lower-body injury ripped away an offensive rebound that he deposited for a putback. It was the culmination of a game where he fought through his injury to play 19 minutes score nine points rack up four steals and finish with a plus-minus of 15 the highest of anyone on either team. Just like that Northwestern had gone on a 6-0 run without Buie and held a five-point lead that it wouldn’t relinquish the rest of the night. “I think it’s awesome” Chris Collins said about Northwestern’s response. “For a team to see there’s a lot of game pressure the other team feels momentum and now [Buie] picks up a fourth with almost 10 minutes to go. And it’s like ‘Okay Boo can’t save us right now. We’ve got to do this together.’” Collins then praised the aggressiveness of Ryan Langborg who dropped a team-high 19 points on a 6-of-9 clip. On a night where Dayton focused on pressuring Buie to keep his volume low the grad transfer from Princeton thrived as a creator. Not only did he step up as a tertiary scoring threat something that Northwestern tended to lack in 2022-23 he also proved he could function as a primary one both on and off the ball. His stellar first half took defensive attention away from his teammates in the second. “Ryan does a great job being the secondary ball-handler” Barnhizer said. “If he’s at the point spot we can throw it back to me if we have a mismatch or Ryan can take it up and we can still run everything that we run for Boo through Ryan. It’s good to have guys like that.” Defensively Collins was willing to adapt down the stretch. Holmes who had six assists on the night demonstrated that he could dominate Northwestern’s trademark post trap with his passing. Dayton which shot 12-of-23 from beyond the arc proved it could capitalize on NU’s late rotations. Instead of doubling down Collins said he adjusted by removing the double-team and letting his bigs play one-on-one with Holmes. The Flyers kept hitting shots on the perimeter but they were rarely open or early in the shot clock. Because of that Dayton never seized momentum in the final 10 minutes. But Anthony Grant’s team did shoot 12-of-17 from the field in the second half and it did go 7-of-10 from three-point land. Defeating a team that shoots that well is difficult to begin with but Northwestern’s heavy reliance on its post defense to force a rock fight — and its failure — made a win seem even more unlikely. Rarely did it happen in 2022-23. It’s also what made NU’s final two field goals its most important. It seemed like every Wildcat perimeter player except Ty Berry who was 1-of-5 with six minutes left had moments where they stepped up offensively. And yet that didn’t matter for Berry. He boxed out the 6-foot-7 Santos to snare an offensive rebound off a missed free throw before nailing a three-pointer. One minute later he buried another one to extend Northwestern’s lead to seven. “When he hit those shots our whole team just lit up” Langborg said. “We were happy for him and it was so great to see him get that confidence back.” Buie who played efficiently and scored 15 points didn’t have to be the primary bucket-getter late in the game because of plays like those. In fact one could argue Northwestern didn’t have a go-to scorer that kept pace with Dayton’s hot shooting in the final 10 minutes. It was a combination of game-changing plays and the emergence of players like Langborg minimizing defensive pressure on others. Northwestern didn’t just take baby steps. It ran in Game Two.  Right before Buie checked back in with four minutes left Dayton’s Koby Brea hit a three to cut the seven-point deficit to four. In the face of that Northwestern kept the same even keel that defined the five-minute stretch without its point guard.  “It was Coach saying ‘We’re good.

Share this story At 4-5 and 2-3 in Big Ten play it’s now-or-never time for Northwestern if it wants any chance of remaining alive for Big Ten West consideration. Can the Wildcats slay a red-and-white dragon up north and take down Wisconsin? Our staffers give their thoughts. Iggy Dowling: Wisconsin 20 Northwestern 17 Braelon Allen should be back and I’m not sure Ben Bryant will. Northwestern has yet to win a road game (much less in an environment like Camp Randall) and I think the three-year drought continues.  Bradley Locker: Wisconsin 27 Northwestern 16 The Badgers have had an up-and-down season in Luke Fickell’s inaugural year in Madison but this game feels like one UW can’t afford to lose if it wants to have any chance at winning the Big Ten West. Unlike in past years Northwestern definitely has a real shot to win here but there are several factors that sway red for me. For one I expect Braelon Allen and Chimere Dike to play; Allen has posted 308 rushing yards and four total touchdowns against NU in two games while Dike feasted for 10 catches 185 yards and three end zone trips in Ryan Field in 2022. Also I don’t foresee Ben Bryant progressing enough to compete against his old head coach. Despite losing Nick Herbig and Keeanu Benton this Wisconsin defense is just too stingy for Brendan Sullivan to handle. The flip-flop results come to an end. David Gold: Northwestern 24 Wisconsin 20 ""The irresistible force meets the immovable object. Northwestern has traded wins and losses all season but has not won on the road in over three years. Something has to give and I think its the latter. NU has faced the ninth- and eighth-ranked Big Ten defenses this season scoring 30-olus points in each matchup so why can’t it continue to do it against the conference’s seventh-best defense? Also with Tanner Mordecai and possibly Braelon Allen unlikely to go the ‘Cats’ defense should be stout again. I think Ben Bryant is back under center this weekend and he leads the ‘Cats to their fifth win of the season."" Ethan Segall: Northwestern 17 Wisconsin 14 The loss-win-loss-win alternating streak continues! But I’m picking the ‘Cats for the road upset for more than just keeping a pattern alive. There is a reason that this team has not dropped two games in a row all season — the coaching staff has displayed an excellent ability all season long to address deficiencies and and not let the team spiral. With Tanner Mordecai and Braelon Allen’s status still up in the air and the Northwestern defense having played some of their best ball as of late I think NU keeps this one close and pulls it off with a late defensive stand. Miguel Muñoz: Wisconsin 24 Northwestern 10 It’s hard for any team to win in Madison — no less one that’s been struggling all year offensively and still has some holes defensively. While coach David Braun and company will put up a good fight this Wisconsin offense is just going to wear the ‘Cats down over time. On the other side of the ball likely having Brendan Sullivan start at quarterback means another underwhelming scoring display. Northwestern won’t look awful but points will be hard to come by making this game a really hard one to win.  Ascher Levin: Northwestern 21 Wisconsin 17 After a close loss against Iowa Northwestern looks to respond against Wisconsin. The Badgers have lost two games in a row but their quarterback Tanner Mordecai has a chance to return from a broken hand. The main threat for the Wildcats is Braelon Allen who averages 5.8 yards per carry. Northwestern will have to be sound in the middle if they want to be successful defensively. On the offensive side of the ball the question is if Ben Bryant will be back. Brendan Sullivan has had a few good moments but Bryant gives the ‘Cats a better attack through the air. Northwestern has alternated losses and wins throughout the year and I have that trend continuing against Wisconsin. Natalie Wells: Wisconsin 17 Northwestern 13 If Braelon Allen can go for the Badgers he should have a fun time slashing through NU’s porous front seven. The ‘Cats have allowed 1418 rushing yards this season which is the second-most in the B1G. Who’s first you may ask? None other than Wisconsin. Saturday is a prime opportunity for Cam Porter to put up better numbers on the ground — he hasn’t surpassed four yards per carry since NU’s win against Howard on Oct. 7. The ‘Cats won’t have enough firepower to keep up with a more consistent Wisconsin offense. Patrick Winograd: Wisconsin 23 Northwestern 17 I am a very superstitious person especially when it comes to sports so I was very close to picking Northwestern because it would continue the trend of the ‘Cats alternating wins and losses every week of the season. Unfortunately all good things must come to an end and I think Northwestern’s coincidental string of results will end this week in Madison. With Ben Bryant’s status still up in the air I don’t think Northwestern has what it takes to win in a tough road environment. I think the Badgers will emerge victorious although if Braelon Allen can’t go this game will be a lot more intriguing. Brendan Preisman: Northwestern 24 Wisconsin 17 Northwestern hasn’t yet won outside of Ryan Field this year. They also haven’t beaten Wisconsin in Camp Randall since 2015 and the Badgers have won two straight matchups in the series. While I do think this game will be tight (especially with both sides’ offenses dealing with key injuries) I don’t think Northwestern is able to end any of those streaks today. I do think however that it will be much closer than last year’s matchup.

Share this story Well if it wasn’t clear enough on Thursday night the Wildcats have an offense.  Northwestern (2-0 0-0 B1G) defeated Omaha (1-2 0-0 Summit) by a score of 87-69 on Sunday afternoon in a game that belonged to the ‘Cats almost from the jump. The Wildcats jumped out to a 17-0 lead to open the game and UNO never got closer than 12 after that.  Melannie Daley was once again the leader for the Wildcats erupting for 21 points on an astounding 10-for-11 shooting mark. There were also four other Northwestern players in double figures: Hailey Weaver had 15 Paige Mott had 14 and Caileigh Walsh and Caroline Lau both chipped in 11 each.  For the visitors from Omaha Katie Keitges led the way with 18 points (on 6-for-9 three-point shooting!) but only had one other teammate (Deanay Watson) score over 10 points. The Mavericks were very inefficient offensively shooting just 35% from the field and committing a staggering 20 turnovers.  The Wildcats got off to a hot start with Daley knocking in a midrange jumper. It was the kick-starter to a 10-0 run that saw the Wildcats block a pair of Maverick shots and force a timeout just over two-and-a-half minutes in.  Daley canned another jumper from the same spot a minute after the timeout extending the lead to 12. On the ensuing possession the stingy Northwestern defense forced a shot clock violation a microcosm of how the game had gone for Omaha to that point. The Wildcats extended the lead to 17-0 before the Mavericks were able to put a point on the scoreboard. And even that was on a free throw from UNO center Lucy Ghaifan just over five minutes into the contest.  The game got a lot sloppier after that. While both sides got more points on the board the first quarter was one marred by giveaways. The two teams combined for 12 turnovers in the first seven minutes and 15 overall in the first frame. When the dust settled Northwestern led 24-8 behind seven points from Weaver and six apiece from Daley and Mott. To start the second quarter graduate transfer Maggie Pina earned the first points of her Northwestern career with a deep three. It was after that that the visitors woke up with an Alison Stephens three building a quick 7-0 run for the Mavericks. About a minute later Walsh picked up her third foul of the first half and had to leave the game.  Despite the adversity the Wildcats responded well. Northwestern hit five of its first eight shots before the media timeout with four points coming from the hot hand of Daley. Walsh also had five points in the quarter before getting into foul trouble meaning that with just under four minutes to play in the first half Northwestern led by 20.  The turnovers continued to plague both teams as halftime neared. Through 20 minutes the two squads combined for 23 turnovers. The main difference was the shooting: Northwestern shot 19-for-37 in the first half (a 51% clip) while UNO struggled to a 6-of-29 mark (29%). A UNO field goal drought that neared five minutes to close the first half helped the Wildcats build a major 46-24 lead heading into the locker rooms. Both offenses raced out to a hot start in the third quarter with both teams combining to hit eight straight shots. The scoring spurt included a pair of short jumpers from Walsh as well as a pair of three-pointers by UNO’s Keitges. The nets were almost completely scorched on Omaha’s end with the Mavericks hitting their first six shots of the quarter to cut the deficit to 15.  Once again the Wildcats responded. Mott and Daley fueled a 6-0 run that pushed the lead to 60-39 with five minutes remaining in the third frame. After that the scoring went back and forth with both teams shooting above 50% from the field in the frame. The quarter ended with the Mavericks snapping a two-minute scoring drought to cut the lead back to 20 points. The hot shooting was encouraging for Omaha but neither team could buy a stop leading to 46 combined points in the quarter.  The hot shooting continued in the final frame at least for the home squad. Northwestern went 3-of-5 to open the fourth quarter including a pair of three pointers building a 25-point lead and forcing a UNO timeout with seven minutes to play. The timeout seemed to work as UNO erupted on a 9-0 run. Unfortunately for the Mavericks it was far too little far too late as they were still down 16 even with the run. And by that point most of the bench players on either side were in so the last five minutes were merely a formality.  The result was made even clearer when the Mavericks closed the game having made one of their final 11 shots. Northwestern didn’t score that much over the final five minutes either but it didn’t need to. After two games the offense has tallied 179 points for an average of just under 90 per game.  Northwestern will head on the road for the first time this year on Wednesday to take on No. 10 Notre Dame in South Bend. Tip-off is set for 6 p.m. CT and the game will be broadcast on  the ACC Network.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story The Cardiac ‘Cats strike again.  Northwestern punched its ticket to its third-straight final four after defeating Louisville 3-2 on Sunday Afternoon. Lauren Wadas was the hero of the game scoring the game-winner with 66 seconds remaining in regulation. All five goals in this game were scored off of corners. Freshman Ilse Tromp was responsible for two of Northwestern’s while senior Lauren Wadas nailed the game-winner at the end of the fourth quarter. Senior goalie Annabel Skubisz recorded five saves. Overall the Wildcats barely outshot the Cardinals 11-9. Louisville drew a corner less than four minutes into the first quarter but Emila Kaczmarcyk’s shot was saved by Skubisz. Three minutes later the Cardinals drew two consecutive corners with the latter one resulting in a goal from Minna Tremonti to put her team in the lead.  Northwestern trailing for the first time in four games wasted no time tying things up less than two minutes later as freshman Ilse Tromp ripped a ball past Louisville goalie Merlijn van der Vegt into the back of the net for a goal. At the end of the first quarter the score was 1-1. The second quarter saw relatively little offensive action with a good portion of ballplay happening in the midfield and neither team taking a single shot for 12 straight minutes. The Wildcats drew a corner nine minutes into the quarter but the call for a corner was overturned.  Louisville’s Rylie Wollerton took the first shot of the second quarter with three minutes left off a corner but it was stopped by Skubisz. The Cardinals got another corner instantly but failed to capitalize. As the half headed to a close Northwestern graduate student Peyton Halsey recorded her team’s shot of the quarter but the ball deflected off the shin pad of van der Vegt.  Even with the game tied headed into halftime Louisville was arguably the better team offensively in the first half outshooting the Wildcats 6-2 and drawing three more corners than them.  Northwestern got to the circle less than two minutes into the third quarter with freshman Olivia Bent-Cole taking the first shot of the second half—a shot that was saved by van der Vegt. Later the Wildcats drew two more corners with the former one resulting in senior Lauren Wadas shooting wide and the latter one leading to Tromp’s shot getting stopped by van der Vegt once again. In the waning seconds of the third quarter Louisville scored to make it 2-1 with Aimee Plumb’s shot off a corner going past Skubisz. The Cardinals only took one shot in this quarter but they made the most of it. Once again Northwestern wouldn’t let Louisville’s lead last as Tromp scored following a corner to begin the fourth quarter. Graduate student Alia Marshall was credited for the assist. The Wildcats drew another corner two minutes later but couldn’t take the lead as van der Vegt blocked Tromp’s shot — her fourth save of the day. The Wildcats and the Cardinals both made deep runs down each others’ sides of the field at the end of the quarter but neither team could score. Bent-Cole took her second shot of the day with three minutes left in the game but the ball barely missed the net. But when Northwestern was a player up they took the opportunity to draw a corner which resulted in a Wadas goal. That goal ended up being the game-winner to send the Wildcats to the Final Four. Northwestern will face Duke in the NCAA semi-finals on Nov. 17. The winner of that matchup will face either UNC or Virginia in the national championship game. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story On July 26 David Braun took to the podium at Big Ten Media Day for his first appearance as interim head coach. Thrust into a position he did not ask for Braun sat at the podium for an hour fielding hard questions regarding a hazing scandal before his time at NU that led to Pat Fitzgerald’s termination. Remember he had only been an employee of the University for six months interim head coach for two weeks and was the first Northwestern representative to face the media.  As the questions continued to fire Braun handled each with poise giving thoughtful answers to each person. As I left Lucas Oil Stadium that day I turned to my colleagues Bradley Locker and Ethan Segall with astonishment simply saying “Braun crushed that.” Braun passed his first test as the face of the program with flying colors. It has been 109 days since Braun took the podium at Indianapolis and he has continued to pass each test he has faced. Heading to Wisconsin this week Braun faced his biggest challenge since taking over the ‘Cats and he had his team prepared. Northwestern cruised to a 24-10 victory dominating the Badgers for 60 minutes to get to 5-5. It was Northwestern’s first road win in nearly 1100 days the first win in Madison since 2015 and the first time the Badgers gave up 24 points in the first half at home since 2008.   If you had said this 100 days ago Wildcat fans would have laughed hysterically; now it is a reality because of David Braun. For the first time since 1903 a Northwestern head coach has won five games in their first season at the helm.  If it was not clear after the first nine games of the season it was made clear inside Camp Randall on Saturday afternoon: David Braun has earned the right to be Northwestern’s permanent head football coach. It is time to remove the interim tag. “He’s the guy everyone looks to and we’ll follow him wherever he goes” Northwestern QB Ben Bryant said postgame. “We love him as our head coach.” When I first learned about who David Braun was last January everyone I talked to mentioned that football was always second to Coach Braun — it was the individual who always came first. Michael Tutsie who played for Braun at North Dakota State told me that Braun is his daughter’s godfather. I didn’t get a chance to meet Coach Braun until NU’s Pro Day where he spent half an hour chatting with us. I still remember the grin across his face when I asked him if his sons had tried Chicago-style pizza before which led to a lively Lou Malnati’s vs. Giordano’s debate. While we did discuss defensive schematics I could not tell you a single thing he said about playing a 4-3 base defense or the role of a box safety. However I had one takeaway leaving Ryan Fieldhouse that day: Coach Braun is exactly as advertised and the defense was going to take massive steps forward.  While it has not always been pretty it is hard to argue that NU’s defense has not improved over the season. Northwestern has given up 20 points in the last eight quarters including a garbage-time touchdown yesterday. The run defense which was heavily criticized earlier this season has given up just three yards per carry in the last two games. One year ago the ‘Cats allowed nearly 200 yards a game on the ground; comparatively Braun’s unit is giving up 150 rushing yards a game. While it may not seem like a huge drop the improvement week after week displays that the Wildcats are getting better under Coach Braun. For the first time in three years it finally feels like the ‘Cats are back on track. “We love to go out and execute the plan he’s putting the place in for us” linebacker Bryce Gallagher said postgame. “We want him to be here for a long time. We want to battle with him each week.” It is a battle each week for Braun and the Wildcats. The ‘Cats have traded wins and losses each week this season and were 0-3 on the road in 2023. Yet the Wildcats are never down on the mat.  As Iggy Dowling wrote about following the Minnesota game the resilience Northwestern has shown on the field this season embodies the resilience its head coach has shown since taking over the role in July. It would have been incredibly easy for Braun who had never coached a snap at the FBS level before to throw in the towel go through the motions and begin looking for his next job. Instead he did the exact opposite.  “What I’ve learned over the years is that at the end of the day we coach people” Braun said postgame. “We coach student-athletes. We don’t coach football players.” Braun has poured everything he has into this program both as a play-caller and head coach. Has he made mistakes along the way? Absolutely. However there is no argument that Northwestern shows up each week ready to play and will be in a competitive game. That is all coaching. While the Wildcats may not come out victorious every week fans eagerly tune into each game to watch NU play a sentence that has not been uttered in a couple of years. Not only has David Braun reinvigorated the team he has also galvanized an entire fan base. If that alone is not enough evidence to show why he should be named head coach then I don’t know what will.  If you opened X on Saturday night you probably saw dozens of Northwestern players tweet #removethetag. Well they are spot on. Most outsiders including myself picked Northwestern to win less than three games this season and this team has exceeded every expectation. For the first time since 2020 Northwestern football is fun to watch and it is because of the man leading the way.  There are two weeks left in the season and NU sits at 5-5 just one (or maybe zero) win away from clinching a bowl birth. Flashback 100 days and those words are incomprehensible. So Dr. Derrick Gragg this is the easiest decision you’ll ever have to make: remove the interim tag from David Braun’s title. He is the perfect coach to lead Northwestern football for the foreseeable future.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Michigan found out that they truly belong at the top of the conference. Penn State (and their fans) found out that the team’s early success was fool’s gold once more. Indiana and Illinois discovered they were actually allowed to play offense despite playing in the Big Ten. Rutgers found out that offense doesn’t apply when playing Iowa. And the entire Big Ten West found out just how hard it is to clinch bowl eligibility when everyone is equally as good as each other. All that and more on this week’s edition of Around the Big Ten! Statement: Made After Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh was suspended less than 24 hours before the Wolverines’ game against Penn State it seemed like James Franklin was in prime position to collect a top-10 win which has been a rare feat during his tenure as head coach of the Nittany Lions. Unfortunately for him that win failed to come to fruition as the Wolverines decided to make a statement not only to the Big Ten but to the rest of the country. Michigan defeated Penn State 24-15 despite having no official pass attempts in the second half having no head coach and having to play in one of the most hostile road environments in the nation. While you can question a few calls made during the game by Franklin (like his decisions on when to go for two or when to go for it on fourth down) or the poor play of Penn State quarterback Drew Allar it was the Wolverines who dictated every aspect of the game. Michigan ended the game with 32 straight runs leaving Heisman hopeful J.J. McCarthy entirely out of the second half game plan. It worked and it felt intentional. It was clear the team felt it had a point to prove and wanted to prove it immediately. Michigan star running back Blake Corum had 26 carries for 145 yards and two touchdowns including one in the fourth quarter to put the game out of reach. In total the Wolverines rushed 46 times for 227 yards and three touchdowns against what was previously the top-ranked rushing defense in the nation. Looking at the bigger picture the win itself makes a statement of its own. The Wolverines now have a ranked win to their credit something that was previously missing from their College Football Playoff resume. They’re also one step closer to achieving their goal of reaching a third consecutive conference championship game with games against Maryland and Ohio State as the only remaining obstacles in their path.  Big Ten teams discover offense Speaking of obstacles there were none to be found in the game Saturday between Illinois and Indiana. The teams combined for 93 points in a 48-45 Illinois win which the Fighting Illini won in overtime on a 21-yard touchdown pass from quarterback John Paddock to wide receiver Isaiah Williams. The touchdown pass was the last of four Paddock threw. He finished the game 24-of-36 for 507 passing yards and four touchdowns. Williams had a game himself as he had nine receptions for 200 yards even and an additional touchdown to go along with the game-winner. They were two parts of a big three for the Fighting Illini in this one as running back Reggie Love III feasted on the Indiana defense as well. Love had 24 carries for 140 rushing yards and two touchdowns of his own.  The Hoosiers showed some offensive prowess of their own highlighted by Brendan Sorsby and Donaven McCulley. Sorsby threw for 289 yards and three touchdowns and ran for 53 yards and two touchdowns. McCulley had 11 catches for 137 yards and two touchdowns. Unfortunately for Indiana it couldn’t keep up the offensive momentum in overtime as they had to settle for a field goal allowing Paddock to win it for the Fighting Illini on the touchdown to Williams. The result for the Hoosiers was ultimately one of heartbreak while elation followed Illinois as it got one step closer to bowl eligibility. Bowl Watch! With just a couple of games remaining it’s time to update everyone on where each team stands in relation to bowl eligibility. For starters everyone will be separated into their respective categories. From there any new developments will be explained. Let’s get into it. Clinched: Michigan Ohio State Penn State Iowa Maryland Rutgers Welcome Maryland to this elite group as its 13-10 win over Nebraska in Lincoln not only broke a four-game losing streak but also guaranteed the Terrapins bowl eligibility. It was a much needed win for the Terps as they play Michigan and Rutgers to end the season both schools that previously clinched their spots in bowl season. In the hunt: Northwestern Nebraska Wisconsin Illinois Minnesota Where to begin? Northwestern won. Nebraska lost. Wisconsin lost. Minnesota lost. Each team now sits at 5-5 with two games remaining. Northwestern collected a shocking win in Madison over Wisconsin 24-10 in starting quarterback Ben Bryant’s return. The win exponentially increases the Wildcats odds of getting to six wins as they now sit with five wins with games against Purdue and Illinois left to be played. After their heartbreaking loss to Maryland Nebraska has games on the road against Wisconsin and at home against Iowa remaining. That situation looks murky.  As does Wisconsin’s. The Badgers have the afformentioned game against Nebraska this upcoming weekend and follow it up with their rivalry game on the road against Minnesota. Speaking of the Golden Gophers they lost to Purdue this weekend 49-30 and they have a game against Ohio State on deck. Assuming they lose that one their bowl hopes ride on that rivalry game against the Badgers setting up a tense couple of weeks in both locker rooms. Eliminated: Purdue Indiana Michigan State Better luck next year to Indiana and Michigan State! As mentioned above Indiana lost 48-45 to Illinois Saturday which gives them seven losses on the season and leaves them on the outside looking in for bowl season. Michigan State joined the Hoosiers with seven losses after losing to Ohio State 38-3 this weekend putting an exclamation point on a tumultuous season. The two join Purdue who had already been eliminated from bowl season last weekend. On the bright side for this trio things can only go up for these schools from here.

Share this story Another game another win. After coming back from an early 19-point deficit on Thursday night to beat UIC in overtime Northwestern left no doubts against Omaha from the moment Paige Mott won the tip. A 17-0 run to open the game fueled the ‘Cats in their 87-69 win. What’d it show? Look no further: Melannie Daley’s midrange game is the stuff of legends Since 2021-22 it’s been crystal clear that Daley is a good midrange shooter. It’s been the best facet of her game. But in Northwestern’s first two contests this week she’s taken that to an entirely different level. After scoring 25 points on 12-of-21 shooting against UIC with zero threes and just 10 paint points Daley dropped 21 on Omaha... on a 10-of-11 mark from the field. The last player to score 20 points or more in back-to-back games for the ‘Cats was Veronica Burton. Here’s her shot chart. This is just comical: You see the numbers or at least the colors. It seemed like every time Daley took a shot in the corner on Sunday it didn’t touch the rim. As Joe McKeown underscored after the win the best part of Daley’s emergence is that she’s improved at creating her own shot. Most of her looks in the past two seasons came off catch-and-shoot opportunities. Daley has thrived in that area thus far but her ability to score off the dribble and in transition has dramatically elevated her role. She’s gone from the leader of the second unit and a role player to Northwestern’s apparent top scoring option.  For good measure Daley added three steals against Omaha. She plucked two against UIC. Even just using the eye test she is probably NU’s second-best defender behind Hailey Weaver. It’s only two games but if Daley can continue to produce at anywhere remotely close to this level Northwestern is in for quite the treat. Northwestern’s defense has to improve especially on the perimeter It was pretty telling that one of the first things McKeown noted in his postgame presser — after an 18-point win no less — was that he was disappointed with Northwestern’s sloppiness on defense in the second half. The Wildcats started tremendously as they forced 10 turnovers and held Omaha to a 2-of-13 shooting mark from the field in the first quarter. However the Mavericks let it rain from three-point land in the second half. They cashed in seven of their 13 looks from deep scored 45 second-half points and even outscored the ‘Cats over that span.  Northwestern had a few opportunities to extend its lead to 25 or even 30 points but Omaha always managed to respond with a mini-run that kept the deficit between 15 and 20. Katie Keitges especially hurt NU on the perimeter as she made six of her nine three-point attempts.  To make matters worse the Wildcats struggled with foul trouble again. Because the Mavericks were able to frequently beat Northwestern’s guards inside they managed to earn 20 free throws — almost double NU’s total — despite a clear height disadvantage. Even though Caileigh Walsh played just 14 minutes she fouled out for the second consecutive game. Against teams on deck with more talented perimeter players who can get to the rim at will (hint hint Notre Dame’s Sonia Citron and Olivia Miles) that just can’t happen. Northwestern’s scoring attack is balanced and fueled by great ball movement Twenty-nine. That’s how many assists the Wildcats racked up against Omaha. It had 28 against UIC. Northwestern hasn’t accumulated 29 assists in a game since the Obama Administration and it hasn’t had a two-game average that high since at least 2002 which is as far back as Sports Reference’s game data goes. Plus averaging about 90 points a game (81 if you only want to count regulation) speaks for itself. What’s arguably even more impressive is that in both wins all five of Northwestern’s starters reached double figures. Against Omaha all of them except Caroline Lau shot over 50% from the field and the sophomore point guard still picked up 12 assists. In all the grand total for Weaver Lau Walsh Mott and Daley was 72 points on 30-of-46 (65%) shooting. Many of those looks were open ones because they took defensive attention off one another and moved the ball around with ease.  For a team that was prone to shooting slumps last year more opportunities to earn higher-quality looks are invaluable. Facing No. 10 Notre Dame in South Bend on Wednesday will mark Northwestern’s first significant test but the offense has shown flashes of potential at all three levels thus far. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Headed into Northwestern field hockey’s quarterfinal NCAA tournament game against Louisville it hadn’t trailed against an opponent in 21 days. But against Louisville the Wildcats were trailing twice and I was feeling a little unsure of their winning chances. Maybe it was because Louisville was the only team to beat Northwestern this season. Maybe it was because I’m so used to seeing Northwestern lead. Maybe it was because the Cardinals were a better offensive team than the Wildcats in the first half outshooting them and drawing three more corners. And maybe it was because the Northwestern defense hadn’t allowed two goals in a game since Sept. 22. I could not pinpoint the exact reason for my skepticism but it was there. But the Wildcats knew better than to get overtaken by panic when they trailed — the key to bouncing back was remaining calm. And clearly Northwestern had more faith in itself than I did because neither of Louisville’s leads during this game lasted more than three minutes. “We kept our composure and like Tracy [Fuchs] said we’re a super resilient team” senior Lauren Wadas said of bouncing back after a Louisville goal.  Northwestern’s win against Louisville was a strange one. The two teams combined for five goals all of them coming from corners. Following the two instances that the Cardinals scored the Wildcats fired back immediately to tie things up so it was very difficult to tell which team had momentum. For nearly 55 minutes of this 60-minute-long matchup the game was tied. Strange games have become normal for Northwestern. Throughout the season the Wildcats have played and beaten several different opponents in several different unique ways. Take the Big Ten Tournament against Maryland which remained scoreless until Northwestern freshman Olivia Bent-Cole came in clutch during double overtime. Or the semi-finals of the same tournament versus Ohio State where the team’s only goals came from a brief third-quarter explosion of momentum. And then the most tense of them all —against Rutgers in the regular season which went to a penalty shootout. So this time if Northwestern was going to win by participating in this back-and-forth goal exchange off penalty corners then so be it. Head coach Tracy Fuchs knew Louisville was a team that liked to dominate on possession so she wanted her players to simply go out there do what they could and play the game. “Louisville is one of the best-coached teams so I knew they’d have a really solid game plan” Fuchs said. “I wanted us to play our hockey which is ‘whistles mean go let’s get on the run.’ If we lose it who cares we get it back — that’s how we generate our attack. They held us pretty good in the first half and then I thought we really loosened up in the third and fourth quarter and really started playing our game.” Northwestern ended up getting the last laugh as Wadas scored the game-winning goal off a corner drawn by sophomore Greta Hinke with just 67 seconds left in the game. Those 67 seconds were the only time in the game where Northwestern was up but they were the seconds that clinched the team’s spot in the Final Four.  I think that ties back to Fuchs’ point. In the end it wasn’t the narrative of how Northwestern played that mattered it was that the ‘Cats simply played field hockey and got the job done. “I’ve done this a million times in practice and [this] is no different” Wadas said of her goal. “[Hinke] gave us a really great shot at winning the game and I was happy we were able to finish it.” Headed into the Final Four Northwestern must be ready to win in more unique ways. When it played its’ semi-final opponent Duke earlier in the regular season it had to overcome a two-goal deficit to take the win. It’s always difficult to play let alone beat a team two times in a season so Northwestern’s difficult early-season win is in no way definitive of what will happen in the semi-finals. Fuchs thinks that the Cats’ are a different team compared to when they last played Duke citing the injuries of sophomores Maja Zivojnovic and Aerin Kyrs as just one reason why.  “Our corner has developed their corner has developed” Fuchs said. “We’ll have to re-scout them see what they are doing differently — I’m sure they will do the same.” That being said there’s a different type of momentum to this year’s Northwestern team compared to the last two Final Four teams. From Big Ten titles to a near-undefeated season this squad has accomplished everything that there is to accomplish in a season except the grand prize. This is unlike the past two seasons where the Wildcats came into the Final Four with bad losses from earlier in the year. In addition Fuchs thinks that this year’s squad is much more balanced than it was in the past compared to past teams that were more dependent on one or two superstars. “We’ve had some really high-scoring high-profile players” Fuchs said. “And we have that now but we’re so even across three lines. We have an amazing defense our midfield is as good as anybody’s in the country and our forwards have the ability to not only draw shots but generate a lot of corners.” All in all even if it doesn’t come out of Chapel Hill next weekend with the coveted national championship trophy Northwestern has already given us a season for the history books. So let’s try to take in every single moment of it that we can. “It’s really hard to go to a Final Four and to do it three years in a row” Fuchs said. “I couldn’t be more proud of this group and what a rewarding season it’s been no matter what happens from here.” \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story The ‘Cats picked up yet another win in their seesawing season putting them at 5-5 and tied for second place in the B1G West. Here’s five things we learned from the purple-and-white’s astounding drubbing of the Badgers in Madison. 1. Ben Bryant is back and playing with confidence Bryant didn’t miss a beat in his first game back in the lineup since NU’s loss to Penn State on Sept. 30. He came out firing on the ‘Cats’ first drive rolling out to the left and finding Bryce Kirtz for a six-yard gain. From there Bryant completed six of his next seven passes as he found holes in the Badger defense. He finished the drive by finding a wide-open A.J. Henning for a 23-yard touchdown and the ‘Cats didn’t slow down from there. NU’s second drive saw more of the same confidence out of Bryant as he moved well within the pocket and fit his passes into some tight windows. He led the ‘Cats down the field yet again and capped it off with a one-yard keeper to make it 14-3. From Cam Johnson’s easy 24-yard TD to Henning’s unbelievable one-handed 41-yard grab Bryant commanded the offense with ease in the first half. He led the ‘Cats to a whopping 294 total yards after just 30 minutes. It was encouraging (and truthfully relieving) to watch Bryant put together such a dominant half of football. After an inconsistent month from Brendan Sullivan the ‘Cats looked rejuvenated on the offensive end in Madison. Bryant will look to keep his foot on the gas pedal against a lackluster Purdue team at home on Saturday. 2. The secondary came to play  NU’s defensive backs had themselves a day at Camp Randall holding Tanner Mordecai to just 255 passing yards on 45 attempts. Garnett Hollis Jr. used his 6-foot-1 frame to force an incompletion and bring up fourth down on Wisconsin’s second drive of the game showing off the clamps he would put on the Badgers’ receivers all game long. In the second quarter Jaheem Joseph flew in for a bone-crushing tackle in the open field forcing the Badgers to punt yet again.  Even after Coco Azema went down with a lower-body injury before halftime the ‘Cats’ secondary didn’t give Mordecai an inch. Rod Heard executed a “Peanut Punch” to perfection in the fourth quarter and Hollis Jr. swooped in to recover the loose ball. Overall the ‘Cats notched five pass breakups and outside of two long passes in the first half Mordecai averaged a measly 6.4 yards per completion. We’ll have to keep an eye on Azema’s status going forward but David Braun has NU’s secondary playing at an elite level right now. 3. NU’s D-line stood on business Coming into Saturday afternoon Badgers running back Braelon Allen was averaging 5.8 yards per carry on the season. The ‘Cats immediately shut him down on Wisconsin’s first two drives allowing just three yards on his only three carries. Head coach Luke Fickell took the banged-up Allen out for the rest of the game subbing in the twitchy freshman Cade Yacamelli. That didn’t matter much to NU’s D-line — through three quarters they gave up just 34 rushing yards on 14 attempts.  Aidan Hubbard got to the QB for his fifth sack in three games and Kenny Soares Jr. picked up his first sack of the season. The ‘Cats entered the day allowing the second-most yards on the ground in the B1G but they didn’t show it in Madison. NU executed their defensive plan perfectly — the combination of stuffing the run and utilizing a two-high shell gave Mordecai no choice but to play an ultra-conservative brand of football.  4. NU will go bowling this year The Wildcats picked up their fifth win of the season and ended a horrific 14-game losing streak on the road. Now at 5-5 NU is one win away from qualifying for its first bowl appearance since 2021. That year Northwestern won the Citrus Bowl against Auburn behind quarterback Peyton Ramsey and a freshman Cam Porter. How the times have changed — the ‘Cats have had their fair share of turmoil and hardships between then and now. NU’s final two games will be at home against Purdue and at Illinois. The Boilermakers sit at 3-7 and while they just beat Minnesota 49-30 they also got walloped by Wisconsin in late September. Meanwhile the Fighting Illini are in a five-way tie with NU for second place in the B1G West. Braun has taken the ‘Cats too far this season to not pick up the sixth and final win necessary to qualify for a bowl. Speaking of Braun... 5. Take the interim tag off David Braun It’s truly extraordinary what Braun has done in his first year at the FBS level. His performance as defensive coordinator for North Dakota State spoke for itself but there were obviously questions as to how he would handle the jump to a competitive B1G landscape especially after being thrust into the head coaching job. He has more than delivered instilling his relentless nature and drive into NU’s players.  This passion was evident in Madison — he was absolutely hyped after Wisconsin kicker Nathaniel Vakos missed a 40-yard field goal in the second quarter. Before the fourth quarter began the ‘Cats danced their hearts out on the sideline to “Jump Around.” There’s just a different energy that was completely missing from the team last season. Derrick Gragg don’t make a mistake this winter. You have the perfect coach to lead the ‘Cats of the future right here. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Heading into its Midwest Regional in Stillwater Oklahoma last Friday Northwestern didn’t have a ton to lose. With No. 5 Oklahoma State and No. 18 Iowa State having established themselves as the prohibitive favorites to lock up the region’s two automatic bids to the NCAA Championship the Wildcats were projected to finish a distant third. It appeared that they wouldn’t have much of a chance at securing an at-large bid barring anything crazy.  Yet that may have helped the ‘Cats race more freely at Oklahoma State. Northwestern finished third in the 32-team field but the top of its lineup thrived. Ava Earl Kalea Bartolotto and Katherine Hessler earned All-Region honors with Earl punching a ticket to Nationals in Charlottesville Virginia on Nov. 18 thanks to her eighth-place finish. The six-kilometer course at Stillwater is one of the nation’s toughest largely due to the steepness and length of its inclines and downhills. Northwestern struggled on the terrain when it raced there for the NCAA title meet last year. Given Oklahoma State’s experience with its home course the favorite possessed that advantage in addition to its abundance of talent. However in what might have been a concerted effort to take a shot at shaking up the team standings the Wildcats got out hard. The 6K course starts out with a wide steep decline which Northwestern’s top seven runners used to firmly position themselves in the immediate chase pack. DePaul’s Olivia Borowiak and Nina Amicon had tried to create even more chaos by separating themselves from the field but NU had a huge pack just a second behind them. A little over a kilometer in Northwestern’s entire lineup was within two seconds of each other ranging from fourth place to 16th. That of course put the Wildcats in first place. As the chase pack went through the first-mile marker in a little under 5:10 it hit some of the rolling hills. Northwestern’s back scorers were starting to fall behind but Hessler Earl Bartolotto and Anna Delgado were still in the race’s top 25 through 2500 meters.  The bigger problem was that the Cowgirls were putting the stamp on a swift response after a conservative start. Right when Earl was about to lead a slew of runners (including Hessler) up a steep hill Oklahoma State’s Taylor Roe and Molly Born calmly placed themselves in front at the climb’s base and took control of the chase pack. Farther back in the race Iowa State’s second-through-sixth runners each moved up more than 20 spots. Just like that through 2830 meters Oklahoma State had taken the lead with the Cyclones hot on Northwestern’s tail. What was really encouraging for Northwestern’s top scorers though was that they responded. As the chase pack ripped apart at around 3K Hessler stuck with a group of around five runners up near the front while Earl Bartolotto and Delgado didn’t cede ground.  That really paid off about 400 meters later when Earl latched to the back of Hessler’s pack as it swallowed up Borowiak. And then at 3700 meters Earl made a move into the lead up one of the course’s steepest hills. As Born and Roe covered it Hessler challenged those three near the front. Everything looked good on camera but ISU continued to dominate the middle. Having moved up another combined 35 places Iowa State took over the No. 2 spot.  That didn’t stop Earl from threatening the individual crown as she positioned herself in the lead as late as 800 meters left in the race. Hessler sat between two packs in no-woman’s-land and Bartolotto was clinging to the back of the next one. The race’s final kilometer was where Oklahoma State’s top athletes really separated themselves. Roe Born and individual champion Billah Jepkirui took advantage of a hill and an ensuing bend to create significant separation. The Cowgirls ended up putting three runners in the top five and five in the top 12 en route to an incredible winning score of 30 points. Nevertheless Earl closed fairly well given that she had led multiple packs of runners for a decent portion of the race. With Bartolotto kicking hard right behind her Earl finished in 20:42 for eighth place while her grad student teammate came in ninth a second later. Hessler who dropped out of the top 10 following that final surge came 13th in 20:47. All three earned All-Region honors with Earl and Bartolotto doing so for the second straight year. Because Earl was one of the four fastest runners who didn’t race for a top-two team in the region she automatically earned an individual berth to NCAAs. Earl is the first individual Nationals qualifier from Northwestern since Rachel McCardell in 2021. Behind the trio of Earl Bartolotto and Hessler Delgado came in 49th (21:42) and Fiona Lenth took 76th (22:07) as the final scorers. While the large gap between the Wildcats’ top three and next two wasn’t the only thing that did them in — Iowa State beat them by 80 points — it didn’t help that Delgado and Lenth fell back a combined 36 spots in the final 1100 meters. In fairness though finishing in the top 50 for a race like this is a lot to ask from a first-year in Delgado and someone who’s already enjoyed significant breakout races in Lenth. ""At the No. 6 and No. 7 spots Maddy Whitman and Adele Magaud both finished in the top 100 in 22:13 and 22:22 respectively. Northwestern finished with 155 points in total and third in the Midwest Region overall which is the teams third-best finish since 2000."" Earl will head out to Charlottesville next Saturday to conclude her season at the University of Virginia’s Panorama Farms Cross Country Course.

Let’s dive in. If you buy something from an SB Nation link Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Share this story With only two weeks left in the college football regular-season schedule eyes are starting to shift to end-of-year conference championship games the College Football Playoff committee’s rankings (as controversial/nebulous as they may be) and of course bowl season. Whether you’re a sicko like me and partake in ESPN Fantasy’s Bowl Mania every year or simply want to watch two high-level programs square off in a fun playoff contest there’s something for everyone to enjoy. After missing out on partaking in a bowl contest each of the last two years Northwestern is virtually a lock to make one in 2023. For one the Wildcats already have five wins and need to beat either 3-7 Purdue or 5-5 Illinois to solidify the crucial sixth win — which would promise eligibility. For context ESPN FPI gives the Wildcats a 71.6% chance to get to six-plus victories. Even in the instance that does not occur NU led the nation in Academic Progress Rate last year so the Wildcats would get top priority among any 5-7 teams. Altogether there are 41 bowl games including the two CFP semifinal matchups; that leaves 82 teams to participate in such matchups. So far 58 of those slots have been claimed including by six Big Ten squads (Michigan Ohio State Penn State Iowa Rutgers and Maryland). That means that 24 more programs can solidify their spots in the final two games. In terms of the Big Ten it’s a guarantee that either Northwestern or Illinois will earn a berth with both teams having five wins and the two squaring off next week. Plus 5-5 Wisconsin takes on 5-5 Nebraska this Saturday and then 5-5 Minnesota so at least one of those three teams will garner contention (and probably two if the Gophers win at home). Despite the quirkiness of each unique bowl game and its glorious traditions it’s impossible for the ‘Cats to qualify for each because of specific conference affiliations. Also NU will not be making the CFP or a New Year’s Six bowl even if it wins out so that eliminates some more storied stages. Nonetheless there are still several realistic bowl games for the Wildcats whose outcomes range from 5-7 to 7-5. Get acquainted with their details and their likelihoods below. Note: Records listed were prior to bowl games being played. SRS Distribution Las Vegas Bowl Date: Saturday Dec. 23 Time: 6:30 p.m. CT/4:30 p.m. PT Location: Allegiant Stadium (Las Vegas Nevada) Opposing Conference: PAC-12 2022 Result: Oregon State (9-3) def. Florida (6-6) The earliest possibility on the bowl game slate comes all the way out west in Sin City. What better way to send off the PAC-12 as we know it by having Northwestern battle a Western foe in its last dance? However this game may not be super likely for the Wildcats. In the last four iterations of the Las Vegas Bowl seven of the eight competitors had at least seven wins although the 6-6 Gators snuck in last season. Based on an alternating rotation the last Big Ten squad to compete in Vegas was 8-4 Wisconsin which beat Arizona State in 2021. The Badgers finished second in the Big Ten West that season; the ‘Cats could do the same in 2023 but it still may not be sufficient. Current projections for Big Ten teams in this game are Maryland (Action Network) Iowa (The Athletic) Illinois (CBS Sports) and Nebraska (247 Sports) so Northwestern can’t be ruled out. Quick Lane Bowl Date: Tuesday Dec. 26 Time: 1 p.m. CT/2 p.m. ET Location: Ford Field (Detroit Michigan) Opposing Conference: MAC 2022 Result: New Mexico State (6-6) def. Bowling Green State (6-6) 24-19 For some reason this one just feels the most on-brand for Northwestern. For one the Wildcats’ primarily midwestern-based fanbase could more easily get to Detroit; also Ben Bryant played at Eastern Michigan in 2021 so there’s a MAC connection too. The ‘Cats getting to six wins is the most realistic outcome and that would put them in the prime range for the requisite record to play here based on 2022. The previous six competitors from 2018-21 in the Quick Lane Bowl never exceeded eight wins; more specifically three went 7-5 while two went 6-6. One of those .500 teams was Minnesota in 2018. CBS Sports projects Northwestern to take on a 4-6 Northern Illinois from the Motor City — which would mean another Rocky Lombardi vs. Wildcats matchup — while the other three aforementioned outlets have three other .500 Big Ten West squads. Guaranteed Rate Bowl Date: Tuesday Dec. 26 Time: 8 p.m. CT/6 p.m. PT Location: Chase Field (Phoenix Arizona) Opposing Conference: Big 12 2022 Result: Wisconsin (6-6) def. Oklahoma State (7-5) 24-17 The Wildcats have already played in one baseball stadium this year so why not make it two? That could become a reality if Northwestern is selected to play in the Guaranteed Rate Bowl (not to be confused with nearby Guaranteed Rate Field). Last year’s matchup pitted the middling Badgers against the marginally better Cowboys and the 2021 and 2019 versions witnessed 6-6 teams get invites. As long as Northwestern wins one more game this one feels like it could be in the cards. Action Network’s Brett McMurphy prognosticates the ‘Cats to take on Kansas from Phoenix — the projected line of Jayhawks -11.5 reflects what would be a very formidable opponent. Two sites have the Terrapins flying out to Arizona. Bad Boy Mowers Pinstripe Bowl Date: Thursday Dec. 28 Time: 1:15 p.m. CT/2:15 p.m. ET Location: Yankee Stadium (Bronx New York) Opposing Conference: ACC 2022 Result: Minnesota (8-4) def. Syracuse (7-5) 28-20 Fans of the purple and white sure know this venue and atmosphere well with NU having defeated Pitt in the 2016 Pinstripe Bowl. A repeat seven years later could very well occur. Both of last year’s competitors had at least seven wins but the threshold for taking swings in the Bronx was lower than the two instances prior: both Maryland and Michigan State went 6-6 in 2021 and 2019 respectively. It’s important to consider that the selection committee may favor a team from the East Coast (e.g. Rutgers or Maryland) that would have more fans flock to 161st Street and that nine different Big Ten squads have played in this game in the last nine years so repeating recent programs might not be on the docket. Maybe unsurprisingly all of the four outlets think the Scarlet Knights will get this slot. TransPerfect Music City Bowl Date: Saturday Dec. 30 Time: 1 p.m. CT Location: Nissan Stadium (Nashville Tennessee) Opposing Conference: SEC 2022 Result: No. 21 Iowa (7-5) def. Kentucky (7-5) 21-0 Another name that will evoke positive memories for ‘Cats fans: Northwestern edged out Kentucky 24-23 six years ago from Nashville. At that point the Wildcats were No. 24 but that ranking (presumably) won’t be applicable this time around. In the last two years every team partaking in the Music City Bowl had already won a minimum of seven games which would require the Wildcats to beat the Boilermakers and Fighting Illini. However the two games prior saw 6-6 Mississippi State and 6-6 Purdue battle from Nissan Stadium. Overall because this was NU’s third-most recent bowl appearance I would be skeptical of the program making another trip down south. 247Sports’ Brad Crawford posited Northwestern dueling Tennessee in this game which would be tough in terms of crowd distribution proportions. Other projections for the Big Ten representative are Wisconsin and Minnesota. ReliaQuest Bowl Date: Monday Jan. 1 Time: 11 a.m. CT/12 p.m. ET Location: Raymond James Stadium (Tampa Florida) Opposing Conference: SEC 2022 Result: No. 24 Mississippi State (8-4) def. Illinois (8-4) 19-10 Fundamentally this game is unlikely for a few reasons. To start the Big Ten does not have a guaranteed spot down in Tampa. If a team from its conference is selected to play in the Orange Bowl then the ACC would take over. Assuming that Michigan and Ohio State don’t both make the CFP one of UM OSU or Penn State could easily play down in Miami. In fact all four sites think that the Buckeyes will do so. In that case this would be moot for the Wildcats. If not though this game is definitely of a higher tier of competition. The last five ReliaQuest Bowls have featured ranked opponents including programs that posted their best seasons in recent memory like Illinois and Indiana. Excluding the COVID 2020 season only one team has qualified for this bowl game having under eight wins since 2019. Sure there’s a hyper-slim chance that Northwestern could make this game but don’t pack your bags for South Florida for several compounding reasons. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Everything went well for the ‘Cats on Saturday against Wisconsin in a 24-10 domination of the Badgers. Starting quarterback Ben Bryant came back from injury and showed everyone why he was QB1 to start the year. He threw for 195 yards and two touchdowns with no picks but he looked even more impressive than those numbers give him credit for. Cam Porter was running angry. A.J. Henning had his best game as a Wildcat. The defense held Wisconsin without a touchdown until garbage time. It was a near-perfect contest for Northwestern. Now the ‘Cats focus their attention on the Boilermakers as they look to go bowling. Here are three matchups to watch this Saturday: Ben Bryant vs Purdue’s pass defense Bryant was electric in the first half of the Wisconsin game for the Northwestern offense. He could do no wrong throwing touchdown passes to A.J. Henning and Cam Johnson and running one in for another score. Bryant had the ‘Cats out to a 24-3 lead before anyone could even blink. Then in the second half Bryant and the Northwestern offense were held scoreless. Thanks to the defense it didn’t matter much but the offense did noticeably cool down after the first half. It was to be expected though against a Wisconsin defense that is not too shabby. The Badgers rank seventh in the Big Ten in scoring defense giving up 19.6 points per game and eighth in passing defense allowing 198.1 air yards per game. The good news for Bryant heading into the matchup with Purdue is that it is literally impossible to find a worse defense in the conference. The Boilermakers are allowing a whopping 31.1 points per game and a lot of the damage is coming through the air. They are also allowing 244.2 yards passing per contest.  Having Bryant back at the helm is a major boost for the ‘Cats as they try to clinch a bowl game. His ability to push the ball down the field through the air is undeniably better than Brendan Sullivan’s and it (theoretically) gives Northwestern a huge advantage against Purdue. Bryant needs to be able to do damage against this secondary. It has been taken advantage of again and again this season and Northwestern needs to be no different.  Devin Mockobee vs Northwestern’s line Purdue is less helpless on offense. The Boilermakers are actually more productive in the passing game and the running game than Northwestern is this year (by yards alone). Their rushing attack is anchored by Mockobee a talented sophomore from Indiana who has amassed 711 yards and five touchdowns on 142 carries this season. That puts him at sixth in the conference for rushing closely trailing names like Braelon Allen and Blake Corum.  Northwestern has not had a good run defense this season ranking 12th in the Big Ten but it did hold Wisconsin to just 86 total rush yards as a team. The week prior a rush-heavy Iowa team put up only 104 yards. Those are both far off the ‘Cats’ season average of 150.4 yards per game allowed.  If the recent improvement up front continues and the tackling woes stay away Northwestern may not be completely out of luck against Mockobee. But the guy is a problem and David Braun and his staff should be getting their players ready to deal with him. Otherwise the Boilermakers might be able to ground and pound their way to an upset (yes I’m describing a ‘Cats loss as an upset sue me) victory. David Braun vs pressure Enthusiasm about Northwestern’s interim head coach is at an all-time high on campus. Many are calling for the university to “remove the tag” referring to the “interim” part of his job title. So far there is virtually nothing to complain about when it comes to the first-year head coach. He has led the ‘Cats to a season none thought was possible after the program was mired in controversy this summer and projected to win very few games at the most. However Braun is in a new position this week as Northwestern tries to secure the chance to play some postseason football. As I said earlier Northwestern should win this game. Who cares about the spread fans are expecting a win. And that is a situation the Wildcats have not often experienced this season especially not since Big Ten play began.  If Northwestern handles the pressure of this opportunity well then that’s just one more reason for the university to keep Braun around long-term. If it doesn’t then it will be up to a rivalry weekend battle against Illinois to keep the ‘Cats’ bowl dreams alive. Locking it up this week would be incredibly ideal. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After picking up its first road in nearly 1100 days Northwestern returns to Evanston for the final time at Ryan Field for the season and possibly for good to take on the Purdue Boilermakers. As the ‘Cats prepare for the Boilermakers read what interim head coach David Braun told the media on Monday afternoon. This press conference has been edited for brevity and clarity. Opening Statement: “Would like to just start off by congratulating Tracey Fuchs and women’s field hockey off to the Final Four. Was fortunate enough to step down for the second half with my wife and boys yesterday. It was awesome to see the way that that team continued to battle and got a big win late. Exciting weekend for for all Northwestern athletics. Again congratulations to Tracey and her team really excited for what’s ahead for them. In terms of this team we’re gonna sound a little bit like a broken record but it was great having the guys back in the facility had a chance to meet this morning and evaluate our performance at Wisconsin. Really proud of the way that we went into a hostile environment and attacked the way that our offense performed specifically in the first quarter in the first half was critical to our team’s success keeping our defense off the field against a tempo operation tempo offense playing complimentary football. Our ability to close in the second half as a team specifically in the fourth quarter starting to flip the field and create some field position was huge but still things that we need to improve upon.  Again this team is taking it very seriously about finding a way to improve just a little bit each and every day. I challenged them to do that today when they come back in the facility and we shift our focus fully to Purdue. We will have an opportunity to get back on the field this afternoon this evening and start that preparation. Purdue is hot right now coming off a big win against Minnesota. Offensively operate on a really high level; defensively well coached some really good personnel. We’re gonna have our hands full this Saturday. Excited for the challenge that’s ahead.” On players tweeting #removethetag: “Love our team. This is a group that continues to just pull together. I take that as a sign of I must be doing something right from a standpoint that they feel like they got a head coach that they believe in. I’m really focused on making sure I’m doing everything in my power to make sure that we’re prepared to be at our best for Purdue.” On being on the verge of bowl eligibility: “It’s something we address. Even prior to Wisconsin you enter the fourth quarter of the season we’ve talked about leaving no doubt. The opportunity for a bowl game is in our hands. Wisconsin was a performance that put us one step closer to achieving an opportunity to extend the season.  “I think that the ultimate carrot for this team right now is understanding that we only have two guaranteed opportunities left to be with this group. And man this group wants to battle to ensure that we get an extra opportunity to extend this season. Our guys know what’s on the line. They also understand that the second we start letting our minds drift too far in that direction we’re not focused on just being at our best for Purdue. But no we’ve absolutely talked about that. I think this group is very motivated to extend this season to continue playing with this group.” On the perception of NUFB: “ I don’t know what the perception is but I know what I see every day out of this group. I’ve said this before: hard times reveal character and the way that this group has responded to just a lot of things going on a lot of people that have been affected in a lot of different ways. This group has found ways to stare adversity down take 100% responsibility on being solutions-based and just getting to work and caring about one another. We’ve talked about writing our story; this group had an opportunity to write its own story. They’ve certainly done a great job with that so far.” On Northwestern Field Hockey: “Tracey’s incredible. She’s been an incredible supporter of our team of myself. I’ll be honest with you: stopped down a few weeks ago just at the tail end of a game. Yesterday was my first opportunity to really take in a significant amount of field hockey. I was just so impressed with their poise against the team that they had lost to. Their one loss on the season was against Louisville and for them to go down late in the game and rally tie it up. and then take the lead late. I just saw a group that battled for one another. that was incredibly resilient. That certainly embodies a lot of things that we hope to embody within our football program.” On Coco Azema’s injury: “Not anything other than the fact that he’s going to be day-to-day in terms of his ability to practice. We’re hopeful that we’ll have Coco back for Saturday. I know he’s gonna do everything in his power to ensure that he’s out there especially on senior day but it’s going to be something that we’re taking day to day. On if he expects Azema back this season: “Yes absolutely.” On Senior Day: “It’s what it’s all about. I think one of the biggest challenges that we’ll face as a team on Senior Day is just really using that emotion to channel that into focus and being at our best. The emotion is an indication of how much these guys care. The emotion is an indication of how much they’ve invested but we need to do a great job of channeling that emotion to ensure that we’re coming out being our best. Ensure that we give ourselves the best chance to celebrate a victory with this group. One more opportunity at Ryan Field. Want to make sure that we send these guys out the right way.” On his favorite moment at Ryan Field: “That evening against Minnesota. I mean that’s a memory that will stick with you for the rest of your life if you were there. Just the way that our guys continued to battle and the way that it ended. It was really really special. I think that has been something that this team has drawn from as we’ve continued to go through the season. In terms of the belief and the willingness to stay the course is as we navigate each and every game.” On the possibility of playing the last game at Ryan Field: “There’s so much history and tradition and Ryan Field. It’s only fitting that we ensure that we show up and play at our best and send it out the right way. If this is the last game that’s gonna be played in Ryan Field the old Ryan Field. I know our guys are motivated to ensure that we do it right.” On if he’s had conversations with Derrick Gragg about a contract extension since the Wisconsin game: “There hasn’t. What I will say and I’m very confident in is that the people that are involved in that process it’s a critical process they’re taking the proper steps that they need to take to ensure that the program is led in the right manner moving forward. I’m gonna continue to put my focus into ensuring that this team is ready to go play at its best against Purdue. “Dr. Gragg has been incredibly supportive of this team throughout this process and has involved our players in this process which is something that is a credit to him. This is something that I know is an ongoing process for him that they take very seriously. I’m gonna continue to control the things I can control.” On his communication with Dr. Gragg during the season: “We’re in consistent communication. I mean we’re talking weekly. He’s been supportive supportive of me and asked me often what we need from him to make sure that we continue to support our student-athletes. “I think the one place that he and I have complete alignment is understanding that we owe everything that we got to make sure that this group of guys has an incredible experience this season.” On playing better in the second half: “It’s something that I know our offensive staff is evaluating what do we need to do to start fast in the second half and close out games. Similar to Maryland a little bit: really fast start against Maryland and then came out early on in the second half and sputtered. But some of it you got to credit your opponent. You got to give Wisconsin credit for making some adjustments and needed adjustments. “What I will say is even though it didn’t show up in points on the board I was proud of the way our offense stayed the course in the fourth quarter. There are some critical first-down conversions that not only eat up clock but also start to flip the field and really create and start to win the field position battle. But that’s a conversation I know the offense dove into yesterday in ways that they can do a better job starting the second half.” On the seniors’ leadership: “Words don’t do it justice. You’ve got to be here to truly understand it. These guys haven’t flinched they haven’t flinched and they’ve served in their leadership role. It has nothing to do with them as individuals it has everything to do with the program and the best interest of the team. “Leadership Council meetings with this group it’s not just our captains it’s the leadership that permeates throughout the entire program. Some of the leadership that we have: even with older guys younger guys on our scout team that aren’t even on leadership council the way they lead through their actions is just so impressive. But it starts with our captains and it trickles down through our leadership. In true Northwestern form I think you can look at every single young man on this roster and say that guy’s a leader just the way that they carry themselves. That again comes back to credit the way the captains have set that example.” On playing more consistently: “The thing that [I] challenged our group on we were honest this morning. We have yet to string two wins together back to back. What a great challenge moving forward. What has gotten us to this point is the way that our guys have attacked opportunities with a ton of urgency a certain level of edge and demeanor of play. Really challenged our group this morning of being relentless in that strain in that effort. Did we do some good things on Saturday? We did. But there’s a lot of people that are telling us what now ‘You guys are awfully good’. Now it’s time to go back stay hungry stay humble and get back to work. I certainly trust that our practice habits will embody that and will continue to push as a coaching staff to make sure that we’re putting our guys in the best situations to come out and start fast against Purdue.” On Skip Holtz and D.J. Vokolek: “I think Skip has embodied humility. A guy that walks in this facility with countless years of head coaching experience and all he’s asked along the way is “Dave how can I help?” He’s helped through his wisdom his mentorship his guidance. He’s played a critical role in the way that we’ve continued to push forward with our recruiting. Losing some of our support staff along the way in this transition just due to the circumstances he has really kind of led the charge with our recruiting department and pushing that forward. Game Day management and just giving me insight and wisdom on how to handle that. ""“D.J. is a trusted colleague a trusted friend someone that came in to deal with me still calling the defense. There wasn’t necessarily a specific position for him to be coaching but he’s helped at all three levels of our defense and has really taken a lot off of my plate once we step outside the defensive staff room “DJ can you take a look at second down tendencies through a coordinators eyes.” He’s someone that just on the side he and I are talking frequently on just keeping me ahead of the game and our game plan process."" “Both have been incredibly value assets to this football team. I think they’re valued by our student-athletes as well. They’re just two men that carry themselves with a ton of humility and are here for all the right reasons.” On cleaning up missed tackles from earlier in the season: “It’s really easy as a coach to step in on a Tuesday practice and say here’s what we’re going to emphasize and we need to get it.  I think it is a reflection again of our guys making a conscious intentional effort and a coaching staff really pushing our guys to just get a little bit better each day just a little bit better each day. “So much of that tackling comes back to playing with good leverage and trusting your help. I think that a lot of things that start to show up on film you go back and watch earlier in the season there was needed an improvement in those areas. We’re gonna get back out there today and we’re going to be in helmets and there won’t be much contact but we are going to emphasize the heck out of playing with great leverage great knee bend and trust in our help. If we can continue to do that we certainly expect to see good things popping up on film on Saturdays.” On Purdue: “Honestly I think they’ve done a great job offensively of just identifying okay this is how the defense that we’re approaching is structured within our structure offensively how can we attack that? I think looking through the same lens you know where’s Purdue at personnel wise? How are they structured? Within our system? How can we attack that? “It’s really easy to get a quick snapshot of an opponent through stats but then you gotta go look at the film and really see where it fits in the game plan. Already as we’re diving into game plan this week you see and hear those conversations starting to ramp up on the offensive side of the ball.” On comparing NU’s game with Purdue’s game against Minnesota: “ I think where the strongest carryover is specifically for us on defense is the fact that our structure defensively and Minnesota structure defensively: both four down structures two high shells. You got to take a really strong look at that and understand the way that they’re attacking Minnesota is certainly going to going to pop up in some of the ways that they try and attack us.” On the defensive line’s improvement: “A lot of reasons. A lot of hard work a lot of humility. For you to rotate like that It takes a bunch of guys that are there to serve the best interests of the team than their own personal stat line. A credit to Christian Smith and the job that he’s done with that group. Credit to leadership in the room.  The Sean McLaughlin’s of the world the Jalen Pate’s the guys that had been here for a while. We brought in some transfers we brought in some freshmen but I’ve joked in this room before the two best recruits that that we got were already in the seats. “Carmine Bastone and P.J. Spencer were walk-ones that are now on scholarship and they’re battling their tails off. The level of play out of those guys right now is incredible. It’s awesome. it’s a credit to the group as a whole starts with Coach Smith and the leadership in that room. I’ll take that group up against any o-line in the country I really would. It may not be the measurables but the way that they’re gonna fight scratch claw and do whatever it takes to help our team win is something that I’m really appreciative of.” On Ray Niro III: “He’s such an asset on special teams on offense provides you depth and just someone else that the defense has to be concerned with. He’s a guy that you love to get the ball in his hands and I’m so happy for him coming off that injury and back at it with his guys. No better way to close out these last guaranteed opportunities than have Ray Niro running down on kickoff and getting the ball in his hands on offense. Really happy for that young man.” On his role in the new Ryan Field: “I’m just worried about getting our team ready. What I will say is what an incredible opportunity for this football program this athletic department this university moving forward. The commitment from the Ryan family to make this happen is really really special. We talked about student-athlete experience and I’ve mentioned it before but to have an opportunity to have a first-class stadium on campus in the Big Ten moving forward in a new and evolving Big Ten is something that’s really exciting for the student-athlete experience moving forward.” On D-line rotation: “There’s definitely a plan that all those guys are going to play and there’s going to be rotation. They’re not on a snap count by any means. Christian does a great job of really laying that out and prioritizing that especially with situational football. Against those tempo operations it’s so critical to be able to keep those guys fresh. And again it’s a credit to the depth that exists in that room right now that we have the luxury of doing that.” On fixing the turnover margin from a year ago: “Credit to the offense and credit to our players on the offensive side of the ball taking it really seriously. Our staff’s done a great job with the ball security circuit. It’s been something that’s been emphasized. I know for a fact it was being emphasized prior to my arrival. Unfortunately last season that was a struggle but that is a credit to our student-athletes of addressing it moving forward not only within their practice habits but their actions on Saturdays.  “Coach Hicks our corners coach does an incredible job with our ball disruption circuit that we work throughout fall camp. Rod Heard I mean that is something that you saw Rod and every single member of our defense work every single day of fall camp that technique that he utilized and every Thursday pre-practice it’s utilized again. It’s so awesome when anytime you start to see drill carryover into games. Tangibly it’s really exciting as a teacher and a coach. Big-time play by Rod.” On burning a timeout due to Wisconsin substitutions: “With the tempo play that offenses have been playing with especially in the last 10 years the thing that they’ve put into place and protected defenses with it. When the offensive team subs the defense is going to have an opportunity to sub as well. Where defenses are starting to take advantage of that rule is if an offense substitutes relatively late they are going to take as much time as they possibly can to essentially run the clock and enforce the delay of a game. What the officials have told us is that if the offense subs inside of 20 seconds left on the play clock they are at risk for having that issue and a credit to Wisconsin and their strategy and tactics. They definitely dressed that up and I think that was a little bit more of a strategic back-and-forth than actual confusion out of their sideline. Credit to them they used the rule to their advantage.” On developing defensive line depth: “It was absolutely part of the plan. Were we as comfortable with the plan in week one or week two fall camp? Absolutely not. But it was an intentional effort by our staff which wasn’t easy. We only had 103 when most of the Big Ten had 120 in camp but we made the conscious decision to double rep during fall camp. The reason we did that split up into two fields and split our coaching staffs we wanted to make sure that Michael Kilbane got as many snaps not just in indy but in actual football as possible. “Through that there was mistakes made but through those mistakes there’s growth. I think you’re starting to see some of those opportunities in fall camp and continued growth throughout the course of the season in developmental indy on Thursday. Really starting to pay off in the depth that’s shown up in that d-line room and in other areas of our team as well.” On being favored against Purdue: “We’re going to stick to the same thing that we’ve stuck to. Not once have we talked about or used external views on this team as motivation — not once. Bulletin board material now we’re good. Not once have I talked about being favorites or underdogs. We’ve just talked about continuing to battle our tails off for the people that are on this team and people that are in this building. We need to ensure that we stay true to that. If we stay true to that we’ll give ourselves a chance on Saturday.” On his message to ‘Cats fans: “Do everything you can to get to Ryan field. This group of young men is an awfully special group. If you haven’t had a chance to see him play live yet this season I promise you you’re gonna be proud and proud of the way that they play. Let’s make sure we send off the old Ryan field to the right way.”   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Note: This story has been updated after Northwestern formally announced that David Braun will serve as the football program’s next full-time coach at around 5:30 p.m. CT on Wednesday. A story that’s felt like one out of Hollywood is continuing with another script-like development. On Wednesday afternoon ESPN’s Pete Thamel reported that Northwestern football will hire David Braun to become its next full-time head coach dropping the interim tag. Northwestern officially made the announcement late Wednesday afternoon. Here to Stay.David Braun named Dan and Susan Jones Family Head Football Coach. pic.twitter.com/HKXsz4gXxt “We asked Dave to support our student-athletes this season and he has done an exceptional job” Northwestern President Michael Schill said in a statement. “Under his guidance Northwestern’s football team has exceeded expectations on the field and excelled in the classroom. The turnaround he has led under very difficult circumstances is nothing short of phenomenal. “I have had the opportunity to sit down with Coach Braun in recent months meetings that re-affirmed what I saw on the field and heard from people close to the program — that Dave’s values are Northwestern’s values” Schill added. “I couldn’t be happier that he will permanently lead our student-athletes on the gridiron.” The move comes after Northwestern shocked Wisconsin with an overpowering 24-10 road victory on Saturday giving the Wildcats their fifth win of the season and first in Madison since 2015; it was also the team’s first road win in nearly 1100 days. After the game cheers and loud bumps of music weren’t the only things heard: NU players also rained down tweets of “#removethetag.” Northwestern’s leadership has seemingly listened. “Upon his arrival at Northwestern I quickly identified that Coach Braun embodies the values of our athletic department: respect integrity service and excellence” Northwestern athletic director Derrick Gragg said in a statement. “It was the right decision to appoint him as the interim leader and I congratulate Coach Braun on being named the head coach of our football program. He has earned this position. “Coach Braun has rallied the team under very adverse circumstances” Gragg continued. “He has gained the respect of the student-athletes the staff parents alumni and our fans.” In his first ever job as a head coach at any level of football Braun has already won more games this year than the Wildcats did in 2021 and 2022 combined. He’s the first Northwestern coach to win five or more games as a newcomer since 1903 and could very well be the Big Ten Coach of the Year frontrunner. “I am truly honored for the opportunity to continue leading Northwestern’s football program” Coach Braun said in a release on Wednesday afternoon. “Over the past five months having the chance to lead this group has been the opportunity of a lifetime. Moving forward my mission is to build on this positive momentum aiming to create one of the best experiences in college football for our student-athletes... “I want to express my gratitude to President Schill Dr. Gragg and the search committee for entrusting me with the leadership of this program. And above all a thank you to my wife Kristin for supporting me every step along the way.” At 5-5 NU has two more games left in its regular season including possibly the last ever contest at the current Ryan Field this Saturday against Purdue. As it turns out it might be the final matchup on Central Street with this building — but also the first with Braun as the school’s next head coach.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story With just two weeks until the regular season comes to a close the competition in the Big Ten is heating up. Between Michigan’s statement win over No. 9 Penn State and Illinois’s nail-biting overtime victory over Indiana Week 11 provided just a glimpse of what fans could be in store for throughout the end of the season. Although it’s just a formality that either Michigan or Ohio State will win the Big Ten this year there are still several exciting storylines to follow. For starters do the Wolverines or the Buckeyes if not both make the playoffs? Who wins the contentious Big Ten West? And most importantly will Northwestern clinch a bowl game on Saturday against Purdue? There’s a lot to look forward to as the season winds down. But for now let’s revisit what happened this past weekend in this week’s Big Ten Power Rankings. 1. Michigan (10-0 7-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 1 Last Result: 24-15 win at Penn State Next Game: at Maryland No Harbaugh? No problem. Under interim coach Sherrone Moore the Wolverines took care of business against Penn State — its first ranked opponent of the season — as James Franklin dropped to 3-7 all-time against Michigan. The story of the day was the run game as Blake Corum erupted for 145 yards and two touchdowns. Donovan Edwards also contributed with a rushing touchdown of his own while the defense held Nittany Lions quarterback Drew Allar to 70 yards of passing and a fumble. The Wolverines continue to flourish even in spite of the recent sign-stealing controversy that has rocked the program. They will travel to Maryland next weekend to take on the Terrapins before returning home for the biggest game of the year versus Ohio State. 2. Ohio State (10-0 7-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 2 Last Result: 38-3 win versus Michigan State Next Game: versus Minnesota Ohio State absolutely showed out in one of its best all-around games this season. Kyle McCord threw for a career high 335 yards and posted a 77.4% completion percentage to complement his three passing touchdowns. But it was Marvin Harrison Jr. who caught two touchdowns and ran for one who led the way for Saturday’s offensive explosion in Columbus. The defense also stymied the Spartans’ offense keeping them under 200 total yards despite missing three starters from its secondary. Though it mattered little against a weak Michigan State team the Buckeyes hope to get back their playmakers which include star linebacker Tommy Eichenberg before their regular season finale in Ann Arbor. 3. Penn State (8-2 5-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 3 Last Result: 24-15 loss versus Michigan Next Game: versus Rutgers Last Saturday’s loss to Michigan looks to be the nail in the coffin for Penn State’s playoff hopes. In what has become a recurring theme these last few seasons Penn State once again failed to prove that it could hang in there with the Wolverines and Buckeyes. After kicking a field goal to get on the board first everything went south for Penn State. Drew Allar threw for 70 yards and lost a fumble while the defense was simply no match for Michigan’s running attack. Penn State closes out its season with two winnable games against Rutgers and Michigan State. The contests will likely be inconsequential for their playoff hopes but the Nittany Lions can at least finish the season strong before their bowl game. 4. Iowa (8-2 5-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 5 Last Result: 22-0 win versus Rutgers Next Game: versus Illinois Iowa’s defense was impeccable in a win that makes them the unquestionable frontrunner to claim the Big Ten West. The Hawkeyes have held opponents to under 20 points in all but one of their games this season but their shutout against Rutgers is the most dominant performance yet. In addition to an interception Iowa’s defense held Kyle Monangai one of the best backs in the Big Ten to 39 yards on 13 carries. For his part Deacon Hill looked good under center throwing for 223 yards and a fourth quarter touchdown to seal the game. With the win against Rutgers Iowa clinched at least a share of the Big Ten West. And with two matchups remaining against Illinois and Nebraska it’s in a prime position to claim what could be the final division title. 5. Rutgers (6-4 3-4 B1G) Last Ranking: 4 Last Result: 22-0 loss at Iowa Next Game: at No. 12 Penn State Rutgers traveled to Iowa City on Saturday hoping to rebound after a tough loss to Ohio State. Unfortunately things couldn’t have gone worse for the Scarlet Knights. Gavin Wimsatt threw for 93 yards and an interception while star running back Kyle Monangai could not push past Iowa’s formidable front seven. To the defense’s credit though it held its own for most of the game until the Hawkeyes exploded in the fourth quarter and added 16 points to their total. The Scarlet Knights have now suffered back-to-back losses for the first time this season. They look to avoid continuing the cold streak as they gear up for two tough matchups against Penn State and Maryland to wrap up their 2023 campaign. 6. Maryland (6-4 3-4 B1G) Last Ranking: 6 Last Result: 13-10 win at Nebraska Next Game: versus No. 2 Michigan While Saturday’s game in Lincoln was closer than they would’ve liked the Terrapins came away with a much-needed win behind a solid performance from Taulia Tagovailoa who threw for 283 yards and a touchdown. The key to the win however was the defense which intercepted four Nebraska passes including three on its final three drives to hold the Cornhuskers to just 10 points. After losing four straight Maryland was desperate for any taste of victory and that’s exactly what they got as kicker Jack Howes drained a game-winning field goal as time expired. Maryland will need to carry any momentum it seized from this win into next week when it faces an undefeated Michigan squad that has serious playoff aspirations. 7. Nebraska (5-5 3-4 B1G) Last Ranking: 7 Last Result: 13-10 loss versus Maryland Next Game: at Wisconsin Saturday was ugly for the Cornhuskers but the result was not entirely their fault. Losing starting quarterback Heinrich Haarberg to injury in the second quarter was a pretty devastating blow. Despite Emmett Johnson running for 84 yards on 17 carries the offense couldn’t get it going in large part due to the four interceptions thrown by Nebraska quarterbacks. Nebraska has now lost two straight in large part due to an offensive breakdown. The team will travel to Camp Randall for a game against Wisconsin that it can certainly win but only if the offense finds itself. 8. Illinois (5-5 3-4 B1G) Last Ranking: 9 Last Result: 48-45 win versus Indiana Next Game: at Iowa Illinois’s offense looked the best it has all season as the team won an overtime thriller against Indiana. The reason? Quarterback John Paddock who made his first start for Illinois after Luke Altmyer went down with an injury last week. Paddock threw for 507 yards and four touchdowns spearheading his squad’s offensive renaissance. Reggie Love also had a day of his own rushing for 140 yards and reaching the end zone twice. Illinois’s offense will be put to the test next week against a scary Iowa defense. Altmyer is set to return but after Paddock’s huge game one has to wonder if Illinois has a real quarterback conundrum on its hands. 9. Northwestern (5-5 3-4 B1G) Last Ranking: 11 Last Result: 24-10 win at Wisconsin Next Game: versus Purdue Ben Bryant is back and so are Northwestern’s bowl game hopes. After an embarrassing loss to Iowa at Wrigley Field the Wildcats rallied to earn a crucial win that keeps their season alive. Bryant after missing four games looked solid in his return throwing two touchdown passes to A.J. Henning and Cam Johnson. Meanwhile the defense was spectacular holding the Badgers to three points for most of the game. Next week is huge for the Wildcats. Purdue is certainly a manageable win but Northwestern will need offensive production similar to last week if it hopes to clinch what would be its first bowl game since 2020. 10. Minnesota (5-5 3-4 B1G) Last Ranking: 8 Last Result: 49-30 loss at Purdue Next Game: at No. 3 Ohio State After a strong start to the year Minnesota has now lost two straight and letting up 49 points to Purdue is perhaps rock bottom. Athan Kaliakmanis did what he could to keep the Golden Gophers in the game throwing for 292 yards three touchdowns and no turnovers. The defense however was atrocious allowing 353 rushing yards in addition to Hudson Card’s 251 passing yards. Before Saturday it had been over a month since Purdue put up more than 20 points in a game. With the ugly loss Minnesota’s chances at a bowl game do not look bright. They will need to beat either Ohio State or Wisconsin in the coming weeks if they want to be playing come December. If their performance resembles that of last week in any way the Gophers will be watching the postseason from the couch. 11. Wisconsin (5-5 3-4 B1G) Last Ranking: 10 Last Result: 24-10 loss versus Northwestern Next Game: versus Nebraska Wisconsin is officially in panic mode. After starting the year 4-1 and leading the Big Ten West the Badgers have now lost four of their last five games to drop to 5-5. Saturday’s game against Northwestern was an abysmal offensive performance. Individually everybody looked solid but the Badgers were unable to get the ball in the end zone at all. And while the defense held its own in the second half the 24 points Northwestern dropped in the first half proved to be too insurmountable a lead to come back from. Wisconsin has two relatively even matchups to close out the year as they’ll host Nebraska before traveling to Minnesota for the regular season finale. However given the way the Badgers have been trending over the last month things aren’t looking very bright. 12. Indiana (3-7 1-6 B1G) Last Ranking: 12 Last Result: 48-45 loss at Illinois Next Game: versus Michigan State Indiana was one sweet overtime John Paddock pass away from pulling off an epic upset over Illinois. Despite the loss the Hoosiers’ offense looked great. Brendan Sorsby had one of the best games of his career throwing three touchdowns and taking another two in himself. Unfortunately the defense spoiled Sorsby’s legacy game by allowing Illinois backup John Paddock to have his own legacy game in which he threw for over 500 yards. Indiana’s postseason hopes are all but over at this point but with games against fellow Big Ten bottom feeders Michigan State and Purdue to close out the year the Hoosiers can build a little bit of momentum as they look ahead towards their 2024 campaign. 13. Purdue (3-7 2-5 B1G) Last Ranking: 14 Last Result: 49-30 win versus Minnesota Next Game: at Northwestern Purdue’s rushing attack was simply unstoppable as the Boilermakers won in dominant fashion over a solid Minnesota squad. Devon Mockobee averaged nine yards per carry on his way to 153 yards and a touchdown. Meanwhile Tyrone Tracy Jr. averaged 8.1 yards per carry as he finished the game with 122 yards and 2 touchdowns. Add on to that Hudson Card’s three-touchdown game under center and there was no stopping Purdue on Saturday. This Saturday Purdue will travel to Evanston in the hopes of putting the Wildcats’ bowl game hopes on hold for another week. If the Boilermakers’ rushing tandem exploits Northwestern’s defense in the same way they did with Minnesota’s Wildcat fans may leave Ryan Field disappointed. 14. Michigan State (3-7 1-6 B1G) Last Ranking: 13 Last Result: 38-3 loss at Ohio State Next Game: at Indiana It’s been a rough season for Michigan State and last Saturday’s matchup against Ohio State only added to the list of woes. The Spartans defense could do nothing but watch as Kyle McCord and Marvin Harrison Jr. went off in front of a packed Columbus crowd. Offensively they were basically nonexistent as they only mustered 182 yards. Fortunately for Michigan State fans the misery is almost over. The Spartans travel to Bloomington this Saturday to face Indiana before playing one final game in East Lansing against Penn State. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story One year ago Northwestern lost to Minnesota in a 31-3 blowout — the ninth of its eleven losses in the 2022 season. Four months ago Pat Fitzgerald was fired amid hazing allegations that rocked the football program and made national headlines. Two months ago Northwestern lost its season opener in ugly fashion: a 24-7 loss to the Rutgers Scarlet Knights. Many fans were ready to concede that this year would be no different from last. But four days ago the Wildcats traveled to Camp Randall in Madison and dismantled the Wisconsin Badgers in a 24-10 rout that was never close improving their season record to 5-5 and inching closer to their first bowl game appearance in three years. On Saturday the Wildcats looked rejuvenated determined and out for blood following a lethargic performance against Iowa at Wrigley Field. In Ben Bryant’s return to action for the first time since Sep. 30 against Penn State the offense exploded for 24 points in the first half. A.J. Henning and Cam Johnson each caught a touchdown pass while Cam Porter rushed for 72 yards on 18 carries. Most importantly though the offensive line finally delivered. The squad only allowed Bryant to be sacked one time the entire game in its best performance of the year. One of the main narratives of this season has been the offensive line’s woes but the unit made a statement to the world on Saturday that it can perform when it matters. Defensively the Wildcats shut down Tanner Mordecai and Co. the entire day limiting them to just a field goal until the very end of the game. The run defense was especially effective holding the Badgers’ rushers to 86 yards for the game. With the victory at Wisconsin Northwestern is now one win away from clinching a bowl game for the first time since it won the Big Ten West in 2020. The excitement can be felt across campus and it’s certainly present among alumni across the country too. After all not only is Northwestern competitive but it is surprisingly competitive. What many expected to be a rebuilding campaign as the Wildcats transitioned to the post-Fitzgerald era has turned into five wins and a revitalized team and fanbase. In his first season as the program’s head coach David Braun has more than surpassed expectations. He has lit a spark in his team and his energy has propelled the Wildcats to the respectable 5-5 record they have posted thus far. Should Northwestern win its way into a bowl game Braun should undoubtedly be crowned Big Ten Coach of the Year. He was thrown into an unexpected and unenviable situation and made the absolute most of it. Many fans are calling for the interim tag to be removed from Braun’s title and I would be inclined to agree. Over the next two weeks Northwestern will take on two manageable opponents. This Saturday the Cats will host Purdue in what will be the final game at Ryan Field before renovations begin. The following week they will play at Illinois for the regular season finale. Northwestern has a chance to achieve what would have been considered unthinkable just two months ago. And if the team plays even remotely similarly to how it played at Wisconsin there’s no reason why the Cats can’t shock the world. It’s enticing to daydream about potential bowl game scenarios. After all it’s a very real possibility. But in order for that dream to become a reality this week Northwestern has just one goal on its mind: beat Purdue. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story A win is a win I guess but for some reason this didn’t really feel like one. In a game where Northwestern was projected to win handily (if you go by the exact line it would be 22.5 points) the Western Michigan Broncos put the team to the test for the entire time. A contest that should have been fairly boring ended up being a nail-biting two halves of basketball; this might be good for the average fan but this doesn’t make the Wildcats’ prospects look all that promising. The ‘Cats couldn’t grab the boards. Northwestern had less than half the amount of rebounds that the Broncos had over 40 minutes. Less than half. It seemed like the Wildcats were struggling to nab Western Michigan’s misses leading to a lot of second-chance points for the visiting team. Off of 17 offensive rebounds the team from Kalamazoo scored 15 points — that’s 10 more than Northwestern’s second-chance total and adds up to around 25% of the total points Western Michigan scored in the evening.  Heading into tonight though this type of play wasn’t a surprise. Western Michigan sits in the 84th percentile of all Division I teams when it comes to getting offensive rebounds (37.2%) and NU hasn’t been stellar when it comes to getting defensive rebounds (7th percentile with 19 per game via CBB Analytics).  For a team like Western Michigan this might not matter as much. But against Purdue in two weeks? Northwestern can’t afford to give up 15 second-chance points to a team ranked No. 2 in the country. If Chris Collins’ squad wants to pull off another upset especially in the team’s first conference matchup this is something that needs to change. Northwestern needs its Big Three. Barnhizer Buie and Langborg. Even though the latter is a new addition to the ‘Cats it’s hard to imagine this team without all of them on the court together. Though the three are clearly powerhouse point guards it seems that when one falls the team falls.  Buie and Barnhizer both had a day putting up at least 20 each and going 7-for-14 and 8-for-14 from the field respectively. Langborg on the other hand had a slow day putting up only six points and shooting 2-for-9 missing all six of his three point attempts. Even though the team won his tough outing certainly turned the team on its head. The rest of the team didn’t seem to step up to cover; Berry had five on the game and Nicholson had four resulting in a whopping nine points from the other two starters. If due to some circumstance one of these three can’t play? The team would have a boatload of work to do. Collins said it best himself during the post-game press conference: “We can’t expect to win games with only Boo and Brooks scoring.”  Northwestern’s offense needs time to start up. ""Looking at the Wildcats offense sometimes reminds me of when I microwave popcorn. It takes time to pop. Western Michigan led this game for most of the first twelve minutes; the ‘Cats just didn’t seem able to keep up with their early momentum. They missed opportunities on the first three turnovers from WMU missing three-pointers and jumpers alike. "" After the 9:31 mark of the first half Western Michigan trailed the rest of the game. But before then I’d say they were solidly the better team. This doesn’t seem to be a brand new habit for the ‘Cats who let Binghamton lead all the way through the first half last week in  their home opener. Although Friday’s matchup against Dayton was more promising seeing NU lead for most of the game as a whole it still seems like this offense needs to wake up a little earlier in the game.  Hopefully the Wildcats can bring the heat when they head to their first game on the road this season this Saturday. They’ll head to Connecticut to face Rhode Island in the first round of the Basketball Hall of Fame Tip-Off Tournament. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story If you walked into Northwestern swimming and diving’s afternoon practice on Oct. 25 you may have seen a whiteboard with golf scorecards written all over it. No a putting range was not installed inside the Norris Aquatics Center. And despite the flood of golfer photos that were sent to the team GroupMe in the days prior the Northwestern swimmers were not going to be playing golf. What really went on was a competition in the pool that was scored golf-style. Each swimmer had a par value that was 95% of their best 100-yard freestyle time and they went through three rounds of swimming to figure out their score. The first round was a 75-yard freestyle and another 25 yards the second round was two 50s and the final round was four 25s. To determine a winner swimmers added up their times from each racing segment and subtracted the total from their par value after each round. This golf game was more than just mixing two sports into one. It was a reflection of head coach Rachel Stratton-Mills’ philosophy that athletes should be swimming at 95% of their maximum swimming velocity in practice plus a way of making training both productive and fun. “We can have this environment where [the swimmers] are excited to show up every day” Stratton-Mills told Inside NU. “But when they come in they still know that [what they practice] is something that’s really based in physiology and really based in a principle that we believe is going to help them get better. And I think they’re starting to learn that about us and enjoying that.” Stratton-Mills who was hired by Northwestern as the team’s head coach in August was given a program that was starting from a blank slate. On the women’s side all but one individual NCAA Championship qualifier from the previous season had either transferred graduated or redshirted. Meanwhile the men were coming off a subpar season by their standards where they finished second-to-last in the Big Ten and they received a promising but inexperienced first-year class that could become the backbone of their team. Given all this Stratton-Mills has still set a lofty goal for both the men’s and women’s programs to finish top ten in the NCAA in the near future. And she knows getting a program to that level starts with implementing small things that make big differences. How does Stratton-Mills know this is possible? The answer is that she’s seen it happen all before. Up until Athletic Director Derrick Gragg hired her at Northwestern Stratton-Mills had practically done everything besides heading a college swim team. She served as an assistant coach at Dartmouth and Maryland. She led age group-level teams such as the Santa Monica Swim Team and Asphalt Green Aquatics and in her time at the latter club she helped Lia Neal make the 2012 U.S. Olympic team. She’s been named a Team USA assistant at international meets like the 2011 World Junior Championships and the 2012 Short Course World Championships. She traveled the country for 15 months with her husband Glenn for his business GoSwim. And most recently Stratton-Mills worked under Bob Bowman at Arizona State University — as an assistant coach from 2017 to 2019 and then as an associate head coach from 2019 to 2023. In Tempe she primarily coached women who raced short-distance events. Bowman is best known for being the head coach of Michael Phelps the most decorated Olympian of all time but what he’s done for ASU might just be the most impressive feat of his career. When he took over the program in 2015 the Sun Devils’ men’s team was the worst program in the PAC-12 and scored zero points at its most recent NCAA Championships. Eight seasons later the team won its first-ever PAC-12 Championship and finished second at the 2023 NCAA Championships the highest concluding post in program history.  During Arizona State’s rise to success though Northwestern was experiencing something very different.  In June Katie Robinson Northwestern’s head coach for the past three seasons unexpectedly left Evanston for an open associate head coaching position at Stanford. This departure followed that of two former NU coaches: associate head Andrew Hodgson and graduate assistant Kim Williams. With several of the team’s stars in the portal and a very depleted coaching staff the Wildcats were essentially a shadow of their former selves. And that was when opportunity struck for Stratton-Mills. Two months after Robinson’s departure Stratton-Mills was hired as her replacement. Following seven years of working under Bowman the time finally came for Stratton-Mills to lead a program herself. Running a Power Five collegiate program was the biggest task she had ever been assigned but she was ready for it. After all she didn’t spend all that time under one of the greatest coaches of all time for nothing.  “The best thing I learned from Bob is knowing the chances he took in that first year and how far he came knowing from Day One where he wanted to be and not deviating from that” Stratton-Mills said. “And I think for me I’m in a space where I’m so pleased with the type of athletes on this team and just knowing it is very possible to be top ten if we’re building the right way.” Aside from coaching under Bowman there was also another thing that set Stratton-Mills apart: she was one of four women coaching combined-gender Power Five swimming programs with the other three being USC’s Lea Maurer Alabama’s Margo Geer and Georgia Tech’s Courtney Hart. Being a woman in a male-dominated field was something that made her stand out but at Northwestern she felt that it didn’t define who she was. “The best thing about Northwestern is that since I was hired I have never felt like I was labeled as a ‘female head coach’” Stratton-Mills said. “I have just been coach…I think that speaks to the culture here.” Although Stratton-Mills said she is honored to be part of such a small group of female head coaches in the Power Five she feels that her gender is and should be viewed as merely a side note when it comes to her coaching. She’s here to take a program from the bottom up and build a culture of dedication and that’s what she wants to be known for. “I love this sport I can’t believe this is what I get to do as a job” Stratton-Mills said. “And we’d like to have that felt throughout our entire program.” But Stratton-Mills isn’t just all words. There were very specific actions taken to back them up many of which she took from ASU. One thing that carried over from Tempe to Evanston was the implementation of training groups. From the get-go Stratton-Mills divided her team into color-coded groups based on events that they specialize in. The red group was pure sprinters (mainly 50 and 100-yard freestylers) the orange group was sprinters that erred toward the 200-yard rather than the 50-yard distance yellow was mid-distance green was 400 individual medley-based training and blue was distance freestyle. Splitting swimmers into groups made it easier for Stratton-Mills to handle such a large team of various types of swimmers. “Our sport is so interesting because you can have a male athlete trying to go 18 seconds in a 50 free and a female trying to go 16 (minutes) in a mile” Stratton-Mills said. “There’s so few similarities training-wise and I think what’s important is not trying to ask the same thing of all [swimmers] and understand that they don’t have similar training needs.” However it’s not all black and white. Sometimes Stratton-Mills will combine two groups and have them do the same workout — the red and orange groups and the blue and green groups often train together. In addition swimmers aren’t just confined to one group and could switch things up if they felt that their event preferences changed. A shift in training groups happened early on in the season with first-year Cade Duncan one of Northwestern’s top new additions. On paper the 50 and 100 freestyle are his bread and butter. Coming into college he was one of the fastest in both events in the high school class of 2023 and was initially placed in the red group. However he told Stratton-Mills that he wanted to put more of his focus on the 200 freestyle so she placed him into the orange group. The decision might seem strange at first but soon Stratton-Mills saw Duncan’s potential in the 200 free from how well his back-end speed was in the 100 free. “I think that 200 free is going to be good as he continues to develop” Stratton-Mills said. “He’s got some good endurance at the end of that.” Going deeper beyond collective groups were Stratton-Mills’ philosophies that catered to individual swimmers. When asked about building a positive team culture at Northwestern her answer involved one word: data. It seems strange to relate statistics and math to culture but the reality is that swimming is a data-driven sport. Data is making ripples throughout the swim community and the forces have only gotten stronger since World Aquatics allowed wearable technology to be used in swimming competitions. Performance-tracking brands like TritonWear have exploded in popularity in recent years among teams across the nation. Three-time women’s NCAA champion Virginia even has a math professor Dr. Ken Ono dedicated to helping the team out in the statistical aspect. There are so many variables that contribute to a swimmer’s final result such as velocity and acceleration and presenting that in the form of data according to Stratton-Mills brings a new layer of transparency to the sport. For example Stratton-Mills used data to help one of her swimmers figure out why she wasn’t hitting her best times. She told this swimmer that she was practicing at around 76 to 94% of her maximum velocity which adds more to fatigue than it does to speed development. This data wasn’t the end-all-be-all solution but at least it could help answer a part of why. And with this data Stratton-Mills and her swimmers can figure out what types of physical techniques they need to implement to get better. “I think it’s a start to take the guesswork out of how to improve” Stratton-Mills said of data. “[For] some of our students who have in the past got very anxious about their swimmer or were worried they were going to not go best times I think that’s really helped them take control of their training.” Another “new-school” approach that Stratton-Mills has implemented for her team was quite literally taken directly out of the ASU playbook: the trend of wearing racing suits (called “tech suits” in swimming) in every single meet and even sometimes in practice. In two out of Northwestern’s last three dual meets Stratton-Mills has had her swimmers suit up. In college swimming athletes would typically go slower at regular-season dual meets by wearing standard training suits before putting on tech suits designed to make them go faster at midseason conference and national championship meets at the end of the season. However at the back end of the 2022-23 campaign Bowman decided that his swimmers would be wearing tech suits at every single one of their competitions. It was an idea that captured widespread attention when ASU’s team superstar Leon Marchand shattered the NCAA record in the 400-yard individual medley during a January dual meet against in-conference rival Cal. At that point championship season was still a month away and someone was breaking an NCAA record. This wasn’t normal in swimming but Stratton-Mills liked the idea. Like with data Stratton-Mills thinks wearing tech suits all the time removes another unknown in swimming. The presence of a tech suit can change so many things from a swimmer’s speed to the number of dolphin kicks they need to take off a wall. Wearing one kind of suit all the time allows swimmers to focus on their actual swimming and not worry about whether their “uniform” influenced their performance. Besides it builds confidence to swim at your fastest all the time. “In a scientific experiment you realize how many variables you’re going to change at once and it shouldn’t be all the variables at once” Stratton-Mills said. “Then you don’t know what’s effective… So for me it’s really beneficial to take one variable out so we’re just keeping constant.” The “tech suits at dual meets” trend is still a hot topic with critics citing affordability issues for smaller programs and a possible inability to improve from dual meets to championship meets. But it wasn’t like ASU was going slower during championship season either — Marchand shaved three more seconds off his 400 IM NCAA record at the NCAA Championships this March. In addition other factors played a part in the increased speed from regular season to championship meets as well such as shaving and tapering (a form of rest in swimming tailored towards prep for big meets).  Pro and elite club swimmers wear tech suits for every race they swim.  Why then is it so frowned upon for college swimmers to wear tech suits in dual meets? Shouldn’t we rethink this? Asking for a friend.   All in all if this strategy is working for one of the top teams in the country then there’s no harm in trying it out elsewhere. So far Northwestern has competed at three different dual meets and is currently competing at its midseason invite — the Purdue Invitational which begins Thursday and ends on Saturday. Midseasons are often the first time of the NCAA season when teams suit up and rest so there’s usually a wave of NCAA championship-qualifying times produced around the country. Stratton-Mills’ biggest takeaways from these meets are not the results though. She was happy with the closing speed and development of her swimmers many of whom got progressively faster with every competition. In addition she was also pleased to find out that her swimmers had the same driven mentality as her. For instance at Northwestern’s meet against Miami (Ohio) when the women’s competition was very tight sophomore Hana Shimizu-Bowers volunteered to swim the 200 butterfly to help her team get extra points. She had already partaken in the 1000 free and 400 IM two of the longest and most grueling events in swimming but she was willing to do more. “We have a lot of amazing student-athletes” Stratton-Mills said. “They want to be great and they want this program to be great.” Right now the focus of the team is on midseasons. However Stratton-Mills also has a bigger picture of the season beyond that. Big Tens and NCAA Championships aside it’s an Olympic year which means that some of her swimmers will have aspirations beyond the college scene. She anticipates several of her swimmers to take the spring quarter off after NCAAs to focus on qualifying for the Paris Games and took the Games into consideration when planning a training schedule for the season. However despite her giant future goals and her very detail-oriented plans Stratton-Mills’ aspirations for her first year are quite simple. All she wants is for her swimmers to be proud of what they achieved. “I think we’ll see a lot of them surprise themselves” Stratton-Mills said. “And that’s something that’s really exciting for me. I want my student-athletes to touch the wall at the end of the season and just be floored at how great they did.”],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Suffice to say last night’s blowout loss was not the greatest performance from the Northwestern women’s basketball team. The Wildcats kept things close with No. 16 Notre Dame until about midway through the second quarter when the Fighting Irish offense exploded going on a 20-5 run to close the half. Northwestern’s scoring woes continued in the third and fourth quarters where they experienced a drought lasting nearly six minutes and couldn’t manage to put the ball in the basket. It’s a long season but Northwestern will have plenty to learn from its first major test of their 2023-24 campaign as they try to improve on their 9-21 record from the year before.  Three-point defense desperately needs improvement The most pressing issue on the defensive side of things for Northwestern was clearly an inability to get to open shooters in time to contest and seriously affect their shots. Notre Dame capitalized on these mistakes shooting 45% (9-for-20) on the night. Against a team which usually has four capable shooters on the floor at any given time the ‘Cats were put up to a tough task and their defensive effort just couldn’t get it done.  Turnovers continue to be an issue On the offensive side of things Northwestern showed for the third time this season that ball security is something that needs to be fixed and quickly. After last night’s game which saw them cough up the rock 25 times the Wildcats have now given up 15 or more turnovers in all three of their games this season. The easiest fix for a Northwestern offense which struggled to score (34.4% from the field) and put up 15 fewer shots than Notre Dame is to turn turnovers into quality shots. It might be a big ask against a team as talented as ND but it’s an important lesson for the squad especially as it gears up to face a defensive powerhouse in No. 12 Florida State next week. The scoring load needs to be dispersed Overall scoring hasn’t been a major issue for Northwestern. In their two opening games against UIC and Omaha the ‘Cats put up 92 and 87 respectively and had all five of their starters in double figures in both games too. But when matched up against Notre Dame — which gave them full-court pressure all night looked to strip the ball and held their own in the paint — Northwestern’s plethora of scorers came to a screeching halt. Only two players reached 10 points — guards Melanie Daley and Hailey Weaver both with 11 — while the rest of the starters combined for just nine total points on 4-for-17 shooting. Notre Dame was of course a really tough defense to go against for the Wildcat offense but if they hope to be able to seriously compete against tougher competition players like Caleigh Walsh and Caroline Lau will need to step up on the scoring front more consistently.  Too. Many. Fouls. There’s not much to it: Northwestern got outplayed in nearly every statistical category last night but one really concerning one was fouls. The Wildcats fouled the Irish 17 times over the course of the game giving up 20 free throws as a result. The biggest issue it seemed was fouling inside the paint often when Notre Dame bigs had position and could easily score. Twelve of the ‘Cats’ 17 fouls came from the primary forwards in Walsh Paige Mott and Mercy Ademusayo. A combination of open shots from the outside and fouling from the inside is not a good duo for Northwestern and needs to be fixed.  Mercy Ademusayo ought to be given more opportunities The biggest silver lining from Northwestern’s big defeat was the emergence of junior forward Ademusayo. In her first two seasons with the team Ademusayo was used sparingly garnering just over three minutes per game in her first season and 4.5 her sophomore year. As an upperclassman a bigger role is expected from the team’s tallest player. Though she saw no action in Northwestern’s overtime win versus UIC she’s witnessed a boost in her time on the floor: she played 11 minutes versus Omaha putting up three points and three boards and against Notre Dame she had eight and four on 60% shooting in 16 minutes played. If head coach Joe McKeown can use her right Ademusayo has the potential to make a sizable impact on both sides of the ball going forward.   ],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Can the ‘Cats seal the deal against Purdue? Share this story This isn’t a joke. Northwestern is one win away from clinching bowl eligibility in a season most thought would be a throwaway coming off of a 1-11 season and a tumultuous summer most wish to forget. Yet here we are and it feels good. Following a shocking victory over Wisconsin the ‘Cats need to win one of their last two games to fully earn their spot in a bowl game. This Saturday’s contest against Purdue is their first opportunity to do so. It will also likely be the final time the ‘Cats play at Ryan Field before renovations commence (pending a vote of the Evanston City Council next week).  So before the stadium as we know it opens its doors for the last time let’s take a look at why the ‘Cats will beat Purdue and clinch bowl eligibility yet why Northwestern’s final game at Ryan Field might end in defeat. \nWhy Northwestern will beat Purdue\n Ben Bryant’s offensive dominance Let me say it first: at times Bryant looked like a Heisman-level quarterback at times against Wisconsin. Starting his first game since Sept. 30 Bryant came out slinging throwing for almost 200 yards with two touchdown passes. He looked in command of the offense helping the team convert over 60% of third-down plays and executing many crucial passes to put the ‘Cats in prime position to win the game. Bryant hit the ground running and immediately got to work delivering a spark for an offense that’s been highly inconsistent with Brendan Sullivan under center. Sullivan had his fair share of moments but Bryant’s consistency is paramount in keeping the offense on the field and scoring points. If Bryant could put on a show against Wisconsin he can certainly do it against Purdue. The Boilermakers’ defense ranks among the worst in the Big Ten in terms of yards allowed per game with 389.7 followed only by Indiana. Wisconsin only gives up an average of 332.7 which falls in the middle of the pack. That statistic makes me confident that Bryant will have another strong performance and should be able to garner even more yards and points against a fragile defense. He needs to continue throwing the ball confidently and not be afraid to take risks against a defense that gives up a lot of big plays. If he does that while occasionally allowing Cam Porter to break through on the ground I think the ‘Cats’ offense could have a field day on Saturday and put a high number on the scoreboard. The defense is doing its job The Northwestern offense has been inconsistent throughout the season but NU’s defense has remained a solid unit. There have been occasional injuries but the ‘Cats’ defense has shown poise taking on and beating some of the better offenses in the conference. Last week’s performance was impressive holding Wisconsin to 10 points. It would’ve been three points allowed without a garbage time touchdown making the effort appear even more impressive. Purdue’s offense like Northwestern’s also has a massive variance in points scored per game. Last week PU put up 49 against Minnesota after having combined for 48 points in its previous four games. Against the Wildcats’ defense expect strong coverage of the run and tight coverage in the secondary. Purdue likes to run the ball and NU’s defense should be able to aptly defend against Devin Mockobee and Tyrone Tracy Jr. Northwestern’s secondary has also been a success story and will hope to make Hudson Card’s life difficult. These advantages give the ‘Cats’ defense an upper hand against the Boilermakers’ offense and should put the team in a position to capitalize. David Braun We have to give props to David Braun right? Braun has been excellent in his first season as Northwestern’s head coach especially given the far-from-ideal circumstances he’s been dealt. Indeed he is the first Northwestern head coach with five or more wins in his first season since Walter McCormack in 1903 so it’s been quite a while since a first-year coach has been this successful in Evanston right out of the gate. On Wednesday Braun was officially awarded the full-time job and has the clear backing of his players the coaching staff and the fans. The newfound stability in Braun’s job status might not translate to the field on Saturday but his coaching positively influences NU’s performance regardless. Braun’s idea of complementary football played out last weekend as the offense and defense both showed up when it mattered most — combining to masterfully dissect Wisconsin’s gameplan inside and out. Against Purdue leave it to Braun’s coaching and influence on the team to drive the ‘Cats to a huge victory one that could matter the most when looking back on this season. \nWhy Northwestern won’t beat Purdue\n Purdue has momentum I know the Boilermakers have only won three games this year and are currently in last place in the Big Ten West but for the first time this season it finally feels like Purdue has something going for it. The win against Minnesota last week was a huge confidence booster especially given the rest of the season’s results. It could give the Boilermakers momentum going into this game against Northwestern and deliver a blow to NU’s bowl aspirations. Card and Mockobee had big games and could be in for further impressive showings against the ‘Cats. The tandem is the heart of Purdue’s offense and having the two at their best will be a key to winning the game and overwhelming Northwestern’s defense. Card has been incredibly disappointing this season taking over from now-Las Vegas Raiders starter Aidan O’Connell who led Purdue to a Big Ten West title last season. The slide from first to last has been drastic but there has been a visible improvement in his play recently. At the end of the season with only two games remaining Purdue has newfound traction and might be able to beat the ‘Cats partly because of it. The pressure might be too much to handle A lot is riding on this game. And I mean a lot. First this will be the final home game for many players on this team and Senior Day celebrations will be in tow. These athletes put so much heart and soul into the team so getting a win would be huge for them as they look ahead to the rest of their lives potentially beyond the football field. It would also mean a lot to win the (probable) final game at Ryan Field an apt sendoff for a stadium representing Northwestern Wildcats football for 97 years. Yes the new stadium will still be called Ryan Field and will sit in the exact location of the current stadium but it certainly won’t feel the same. I won’t forget about the prospect of bowl eligibility which is the central premise of this matchup. It’s a massive moment even overshadowing the historic developments and changes on the brink of taking place for this program.  So much is riding on this game that in a way makes it harder for the ‘Cats to win. We often see that teams without proper experience don’t live up to the moment which is a possibility with this group. With the struggles of the past few seasons many of these players lack experience in big season-altering games and that inexperience might catch up to the ‘Cats here. Let’s hope they rise to the occasion and overcome this pressure but it could undoubtedly hinder Northwestern’s chances in this game if it becomes too burdensome. The streak lives on Northwestern’s is 5-5 through 10 games with the team following a particular pattern in its results. The ‘Cats have alternated losses and wins each week starting with the Rutgers defeat two-and-a-half months ago. When Northwestern loses pessimism creeps in and the season appears doomed. When the team wins however the season is reborn and the ‘Cats play clean tenacious football. The differences are apparent as night and day. This week the 11th matchup of the season Northwestern is primed for a loss if the pattern continues. If it holds we’ll be in for a long afternoon as NU’s defeats this season have primarily been ugly low-scoring affairs. If so we might have to wait for the season finale against Illinois to see the verdict on NU’s season and ultimately determine whether or not they will achieve the improbable and become bowl-eligible. However maybe — just maybe — the Cardiac ‘Cats will show up and break this streak once and for all. We’ll find out on Saturday. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story By the end of the weekend field hockey will have a national champion. Ahead of the Final Four let’s take a look at who Northwestern will play on Friday and will hope to play against on Sunday en route to its second title in three seasons.  No. 3 Duke (18-4 5-1 ACC) In terms of a bounce-back season Duke couldn’t have performed any better. A season after posting a 7-11 record and not winning a single conference game the Blue Devils took down then-ranked No. 3 Maryland No. 9 Liberty No. 6 Syracuse No. 5 Louisville No. 8 Virginia No. 9 Liberty No. 11 Boston College and No. 15 Harvard.  Duke’s only regular-season losses came against No. 2 Northwestern in the third game of the season No. 8 Virginia in double overtime — a week after beating the Cavaliers in OT — and No. 8 North Carolina before the ACC Tournament. Against the Tar Heels the Blue Devil actually scored first in the fourth quarter but UNC was able to tack on two goals.  In the postseason Duke made it to the ACC Championship but fell to its ultimate rival in North Carolina surrendering two goals in the third frame.  The Blue Devils have spent much of this year alternating between second and third place in the rankings but unlike its Final Four opponent Northwestern they’re not necessarily an offensive powerhouse. Much of this season’s success can be tied to sophomore Alaina McVeigh who sat out last year with an injury. She leads Duke with 17 goals — which makes her the highest scorer of any of the Final Four teams — and 37 goals. Behind her the second-highest scorer is Hanna Miller with eight. McVeigh is the offensive catalyst and stopping her will be key for the ‘Cats. Another advantage for Duke comes from goalkeeper Piper Hampsch. While Northwestern’s Annabel Skubisz is first in save percentage and goals-against average Hampsh is 10th and fourth in these respective categories. A lot has changed since these two teams faced off at the beginning of the season. Friday will make for an interesting matchup as Northwestern one of the most successful programs as of late takes on one who wants to erase the memory of last year.                       Virginia (14-6 3-3 ACC) The Cavaliers took some time to find consistency showing sparks of a team able to rise up to top-tier competition but also seldom playing at the levels of squads they should’ve beaten.  UVA headed into the season ranked at No. 6. It beat No. 5 Penn State to start the season but then fell 3-1 to No. 14 Liberty. Virginia recovered by beating lower-ranked teams in No. 11 Saint Joseph’s and No. 14 Harvard but then lost to No. 14 BC — a team eight spots behind in the rankings. After falling to No. 5 Louisville 2-0 and No. 4 Duke Virginia began to prove its ability to play quality hockey. At No. 8 it bested No. 2 Duke in a rematch and then delivered North Carolina its only ACC loss. While the Tar Heels came out victorious against the Cavaliers in the ACC Semifinals with a 3-2 win UVA continued to show an ability to stay close with the best. That became evident in the First Round of the NCAAs where Virginia dominated Maryland 4-0 a team to which it had previously lost. Northwestern had just recently barely beaten Maryland in the Big Ten Championship — 1-0 in double overtime.  Virginia is riding the high of its recent success that brought it to its first Final Four since 2019. Pending its third matchup against the Tar Heels in four weeks a Cavalier upset could be a real possibility. After all Virginia is part of a limited elite group that can say it has taken down the top-seeded team this year. No. 1 North Carolina (16-3 5-1 ACC) There’s not much to say that hasn’t already been said about this team. 23-year-old Erin Matson was named head coach just a few months after winning her fourth championship last season and North Carolina has made it to its fourth straight Final Four.  Northwestern may have gone 20-1 and not lost since the season opener but the Tar Heels are the most talked about team in the country and enter the tournament as the team to beat. A storied program like this one is never not capable of winning the whole thing.  Its only losses came from Iowa Liberty and Virginia — all highly respected teams. And right now the Tar Heels are sitting happily with their recent performances. They were relatively unchallenged by Virginia and Duke in the ACC Tournament and have steamrolled William & Mary and Harvard in the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament.  North Carolina’s biggest advantage is its offense. Its 49 goals and 1.55 scoring margin were the 11th-most ahead of the NCAA Tournament and UNC averages nearly three goals per game. Virginia will particularly have to watch out for ACC Freshman of the Year Charly Bruder who leads the team with 14 goals and Ryleigh Heck who has 12.  The Final Four will take place on Friday in Chapel Hill. North Carolina and Virginia will face off at 11 a.m. CT before Northwestern and Duke duel at 2 p.m. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story When David Braun was elevated to become Northwestern’s interim head football coach on July 13 most fans figured that 2023 would be a trial run ending with a foregone result: that the Wildcats would hire an outside voice to rebuild for 2024 and beyond. As it turns out the guy they promoted wasn’t too shabby himself especially for someone who had literally never been a head coach at any level. A little over four months later NU sits at 5-5 and 3-4 in the Big Ten with better records in both departments than the last two years combined. The ‘Cats have beaten solid teams in Minnesota Maryland and Wisconsin and have virtually guaranteed a spot in a bowl game factoring in their No. 1 APR. And Northwestern has accomplished all of this sans Peter Skoronski Adetomiwa Adebawore Evan Hull and ushering in four new position coaches. Effectively the decision to promote Braun following the Wildcats’ bodacious 24-10 win in Madison last Saturday felt like the easy one. Players were actively campaigning for AD Derrick Gragg to “#removethetag” postgame and chants of “We Want Braun!” meshed with choruses of cheers in the visiting Camp Randall locker room. That finally came to fruition Wednesday when Braun was named the 30th head coach in program history. With just two games left in the 2023 regular season the college football rumor mill is already beginning to churn. The good news for fans of the purple and white is that Northwestern has already answered its most major looming question — but there are still a litany of things to sort out. What happens to the rest of the coaching staff? Undoubtedly this is the biggest remaining element to be sorted out in the next two weeks for several reasons. For one several Northwestern coaches were previously hired by Pat Fitzgerald and had been on staff prior to the uncovering of the graphic sexual hazing that occurred as recently as last season. That includes safeties coach Matt MacPherson who was actively named in a lawsuit and is still under investigation by the university. Other NU coaches that were not new to the program in January are OC Mike Bajakian OL coach Kurt Anderson TEs/special teams coordinator Jeff Genyk and LBs coach Tim McGarigle. Let’s start with Bajakian who is maybe the most discussed among Northwestern fans. In terms of production his offenses have been very lackluster over the last three years: the ‘Cats’ 20.5 points per game mark this year is the highest it’s been since 2020. Likewise in that span NU’s offense has generally been unable to string together four good quarters of cohesively offensive football and quarterback development has been an issue. Off the field controversy swirled from Bajakian when he donned a “Cats Against the World” shirt in support of Fitzgerald on Aug. 9. Anderson who’s been in Evanston since 2019 has the pedigree of having crafted two first-round NFL offensive linemen in Rashawn Slater and Skoronski plus remains a top recruiter. But his collective OL units have not met standards in the last three seasons. Despite its veteran presence Genyk’s tight end contingent has committed backbreaking penalties in a myriad of games this season and still is largely not a factor in the passing game (although that may be more of Bajakian’s fault). On the other end of the spectrum kicker Jack Olsen is having a sensational year but punter Hunter Renner has struggled: his 39.2 yards per punt ranks last in the Big Ten. Finally McGarigle’s linebacking corps has taken a bit of a positive step this year with the development of Xander Mueller but the unit was very subpar from 2021-22. There’s also questions about the trajectory of younger players and depth: sophomore Kenny Soares II has shown flashes in a more limited role but former four-star Mac Uihlein has played only 123 snaps. Ultimately it wouldn’t be a surprise to most if not all of such coaches depart Northwestern in the coming weeks; MacPherson Bajakian and Genyk feel especially likely given their connections to the prior regime. Filling such vacancies will be crucial. On top of that Northwestern has acted without a true defensive coordinator this year — rendering the balancing act Braun has performed that much more laudable. With Braun now taking responsibilities as the team’s head coach it would seem likely that the Wildcats will hire someone to be an bonafide DC whether making an internal promotion (Christian Smith? D.J. Vokolek?) or bringing in a new voice. Where does Northwestern play from 2024-25? Northwestern football and the Evanston community expected to put months of contentious debate behind them Monday as the Evanston City Council was set to vote on the school’s proposal for the new Ryan Field (which would also host concerts). But in classically wacky fashion the vote was tabled a week. The overarching assumption is that the stadium reconstruction will still be approved whether Nov. 20 or in the immediate future. But assuming Ryan Field is torn down after the Wildcats host Purdue this weekend where will Braun & Co. call home? With no other local colleges that will presumably be in downtown Chicago specifically Wrigley Field and Soldier Field. The Cubs’ last home game next year is Sept. 29 2024 which would give the Wildcats ample time to utilize the Friendly Confines — possibly for 2/3 of its next two seasons. The first step in this process is obviously the city council’s ruling. Once stadium construction plans are put in motion though nothing will fully feel stabilized until a new home turf is determined and announced. How does Braun prove as a recruiter/transfer portal/NIL exponent? Since he was named interim head coach in July Braun has been candid about the challenges of recruiting in light of both scandals and a radically different coaching staff. On Monday he commended new assistant Skip Holtz for overseeing the bulk of recruiting efforts in the interim. The ‘Cats lost several prospects in the wake of Fitzgerald’s firing but have still assembled 10 recruits for 2024 — a bunch that ranks 97th nationally per 247 Sports. Maybe not unexpectedly though NU has not signed a player beyond next year. Northwestern not only needs to ramp up its ’25 recruiting but also crystallize its identity for new players. Early indications are that Braun will maintain much of the same messaging of the past with an emphasis on character program fit and underscoring the importance of academics. Yet only time will tell if Braun can attract four- or even five-star players. Similarly NU under Braun will have to determine its presence in the transfer portal which has only grown increasingly prominent across the country. The Wildcats added two of their most impactful players — QB Ben Bryant and WR Cam Johnson — from other schools but what will be done to mitigate losses at/bolster positions like QB RB WR OL DL and LB this offseason? Will Braun make the portal a focal point for roster building or will he opt for the “scholastic high school” model of old? The elephant in the room too is NIL. TrueNU has given Northwestern players an avenue to profit while simultaneously volunteering in local communities. At the same time how much will Braun invest in ensuring that NU can compete with top Big Ten (and national) schools from an NIL standpoint? That question could have massive ramifications for the Wildcats’ recruiting and on-field success in the next few seasons. Can 2023 be sustainable long-term? To reiterate the work that Braun has done in the last four months has exceeded virtually any expectation. The fact that Northwestern is one win away from solidifying its bowl game spot after all that transpired since November 2022 makes him a prime candidate for Big Ten Coach of the Year. But Braun will have to prove that he can carry over if not proliferate NU’s bettered performance from this season. It seems that most areas of growth are due to a revitalized coaching staff but how will a younger/more inexperienced roster perform in 2024? How will the Wildcats continue to adjust? Also Braun must take a more proactive role in game-planning in all areas; he’s relinquished basically all offensive duties to Bajakian largely because of his efforts coordinating NU’s defense. How will Braun work with Northwestern’s 2024 OC to create more splash plays and consistency in a sport often predicated by lighting up scoreboards? Per The Inside Zone’s Matt Fortuna Braun inked a five-year deal to helm Northwestern football. That span of time will enable him to develop a full recruiting class and most importantly to prove that his inspiring 2023 campaign isn’t a flash in the pan — that the Wildcats will remain competitive in a hyper-competitive Big Ten and avoid the doldrums of the last two years. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

With five-and-a-half minutes remaining in the first quarter Duke forward Hannah Miller was awarded a penalty corner. However the shot by sophomore midfield Alaina McVeigh was deflected to the left of the goal.  With just over two minutes left in the opening frame the ‘Cats drew their first penalty corner. Alia Marshall’s pass was knocked out of harm’s way but first-year phenom Ilse Tromp got a chance at another corner but couldn’t convert. NU finished the scoreless quarter having attempted six shots compared to just one for Duke.  To start the second quarter Olivia Bent-Cole drew a penalty corner that resulted in a goal by Tromp. Marshall and Lauren Hunter assisted on the first score of the game.

The last-second shot by Lauren Wadas sailed wide-right and the ‘Cats entered the locker room at the half with a tenuous 1-0 lead. NU took 12 shots (four on goal) during the first half. while holding Duke to just two — neither on goal.  Entering the second half of action the Blue Devils struck early. Miller caged an assist from junior back Megan Maransky less than three minutes into the quarter to knot the game at 1-1. On the other end Bent-Cole slapped a beautiful pass to Halsey but she wasn’t able to finish as it careened to the left.  The ‘Cats drew their first corner of the quarter with 5:25 remaining but Duke goalie Piper Hampsch swatted Wadas’s shot out of harm’s way. Wadas attempted another shot three minutes later that was blocked and flew out of bounds. Northwestern dominated the ball for most of the third quarter but the game remained in a stalemate.  The final frame began with a lengthy review over a foot by Northwestern. Just minutes later Regan Cornelius caged an assist from Bent-Cole for her second goal of the season giving NU a 2-1 lead.

Well NU silenced those doubts against Louisville to get to Chapel Hill and dished out a cold plate of revenge.  I think the Wildcats will serve the Tar Heels another one on the road and avenge their title game loss from 2022. They’ve already beaten Duke and UNC’s defense hasn’t been awesome (just one shutout since Sept. 22). I think North Carolina’s going to have to hold Northwestern to one goal to prevail and Maryland is the only team that has done that in the last month. Tracey Fuchs will take home her second title in purple and white and the 2023 team will solidify itself as the best in program history.

Bradley Locker: Win in final Northwestern wins over North Carolina This Northwestern field hockey team just has a sense of inevitability to it passing every challenge with flying colors and never surrendering confidence — the team’s Elite Eight win over Louisville perfectly encapsulated that. Yes UNC is phenomenal (as it is in basically every stick sport) but the ‘Cats do have extra motivation to a) take down the reigning champs b) do so in their domain and c) prove that they were worthy of the No. 1 seed. Betting against Tracey Fuchs’ squad — which combines veteran prowess and impactful youngsters — feels like a very bad idea.

From utter domination to last-minute Cardiac ‘Cats-esque goals the Wildcats just seem to find so many different creative ways of winning. I don’t see any team stopping them soon and I think they’ll be the last ones standing. I know it’s not good to predict things based on superstition but it’s also worth noting that the Wildcats’ season feels eerily similar to that of Northwestern lacrosse’s last spring. Ashleigh Provoost: Win in final Northwestern wins over UVA Northwestern is on a roll to put it lightly. It’s absolutely stormed through both the regular season and the postseason its first loss of the season certainly not setting the tone for what was to come. Winning against Louisville this weekend tasted sweet for sure but the team is cooking up two more. I sense a shocker coming up in the tournament from UVA — they already hut out Maryland a team that toughly contested the ‘Cats in both of their matchups — and clearly home field advantage didn’t mean a thing to the Cavaliers as they waltzed their way into the semifinal. I think the upsets stop there though — Tracey Fuchs will lead her Wildcats all the way. Dylan Friedland: Win in final Northwestern wins over UNC Northwestern is a team that has seemingly only gotten better as the year has gone on. Its ability to score off of penalty corners has clearly improved and will be a major factor in these final games. In their only loss of the year against Louisville the ‘Cats went 0-8 on corners but in their most recent game converted on three of seven opportunities. They will have to continue succeeding in a similar way in order to bring home the national championship but Ilse Tromp and Lauren Wadas are certainly up for the task.  The Wildcats are looking for revenge after losing to UNC in last year’s championship game as well as missing out on the No. 1 overall seed. I think that while the games may be low-scoring Northwestern’s defense and Annabel Skubisz will hold strong and complete a historic season bringing a national championship back to Evanston and finishing off the revenge.  Adam Beck: Win in final Northwestern wins over UNC The ‘Cats have a chip on their shoulder colored Carolina blue. They’ll take care of business against a solid Duke squad and get their revenge against the team that ended their title hopes a year ago. This team is built to win national championships to beat UNC and ready to win its second title in three seasons. Playing the entire year to get to this moment Tracey Fuchs has this squad sitting at 20 straight wins and they’re not about to slow down now. Brendan Preisman: Win in finals Northwestern wins over UNC This Northwestern team has the best scoring margin in the country winning by an average of 2.23 goals per game. Other nation-leading stats include shutouts (12) and save percentage (87.8%). The team is also second in penalty corners per game and 13th in scoring average proving their offensive mettle as well. Don’t let the Tar Heels’ ranking fool you: this Northwestern team is the best in the nation and their senior-laden lineup has hit another gear offensively in the last month. Also Northwestern’s duo of freshman phenomena Olivia Bent-Cole and Ilse Tromp have proven their game-breaking capabilities several times over. With Annabel Skubisz in goal this is a team that has proven nearly impossible to beat. That trend will hold for two more games and the championship trophy will return to Evanston where it belongs.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story That was certainly a season. Despite taking a massive step forward from 2022 and finishing with a 10-3-4 record — reaching double-digit wins for the first time since 2014 — Northwestern’s year carries an air of disappointment. It’s a natural result of starting with an unbeaten run of 12 games before losing four of the last five. In a lot of ways though this is simply an unreasonable feeling to associate with the team and the season it had even if it is the gut reaction to do so. First off back in August everyone myself included did not anticipate anything more from the ‘Cats than being one of the bottom-feeders in the Big Ten. As we all know they blew that expectation out of the water and nearly ended up winning the conference.   Secondly NU’s schedule got considerably tougher in the latter stages of the year. As a result the drastic downturn in form — following such a phenomenal run of results — is likely just a function of the quality of competition. My objective assessment is Northwestern’s final position (fourth) in the Big Ten standings is roughly where it “deserved” to finish and compared to Payne’s first two seasons at the helm that’s a massive improvement. However if NU wants to continue on this upward trajectory there’s also a lot of necessary in my opinion improvement still to be done. As I’ll get into later there’s no guarantee that development occurs and the program under Payne might have hit its approximate ceiling over the last two-plus months. Before I get all doom and gloom though let’s look back at some of the highlights this team produced. Moments to Remember Rom Brown’s last-gasp winner against Northern Illinois The headline and video below speak for themselves. ""90 | GOAL! ROM BROWN AGAIN! CARDIAC CATS IN FRONT! pic.twitter.com/LdlsFZutHW"" Justin Weiss’ hat trick vs. UIC in 4-1 win Based on the NCAA’s RPI rankings the Flames were the second-best team Northwestern faced this season. Behind a career day from Weiss the ‘Cats made easy work of their in-state opponents to move to 5-0-1. Beating Maryland 2-0 in College Park Everything about this match which usually would be a massive challenge came up purple. Collin McCamy fired an absolute rocket past the Terrapin GK late in the first half to give NU the lead and a Christopher Thaggard goal after the break provided the ‘Cats an advantage they would not relinquish. Jackson Weyman’s “antics” in the dying moments put a nice bow on top of an enjoyable Wildcat win. Jayvin Van Deventer’s wondergoal against Rutgers There’s no debate — this was the goal of the season. Van Deventer’s fancy footwork and curling finish iced the game for Northwestern extended its unbeaten run to 12 matches and also played a big role in the sophomore seeing a lot more of the field following this contest. Jayvin Van Deventer. Unreal.   pic.twitter.com/qO9Lvhjb7F Gritty 1-0 win vs. Indiana at Martin Stadium Back-to-back 2-1 losses to Penn State and Michigan State were a huge blow to their conference title hopes but this game brought the Wildcats right back into the picture. Despite being outshot 21-4 Northwestern only needed a Nigel Prince goal in the 25th minute to prevail over the eventual Big Ten champions. Looking ahead to 2024 and beyond I can’t think of a better way to organize my thoughts here than doing “Positives” and “Negatives” sections so that’s exactly what I’m going to do. The back line and midfield will be relatively unchanged. Bryant Mayer (RB) Prince (RCB) and Fritz Volmar (LB) all nailed down their respective positions in 2023 and a McCamy/Jason Gajadhar double pivot with Van Deventer further forward seems the likeliest midfield trio moving forward.  That means the only question mark in these areas of the field is the LCB spot. Either one of Henri Richter or Owen Noverr both of whom saw minutes this past season fills that hole or the coaching staff goes out and gets another experienced transfer to step in following in the footsteps of Ethan Dudley in 2022 and Reese Mayer this past season. Payne and co. have shown a remarkable ability to recruit. The current talent level of the squad is a lot higher than it was three years ago and even better it’s actually showing on the field. If the coaches continue delivering the prospects and transfers like they have the ‘Cats won’t be less “talented” than anyone in the conference any time soon. Northwestern’s pressing and general defensive principles are excellent. This has been increasingly evident as Payne’s time in Evanston has gone on and where most of my praise toward the NU tactical setup has been focused. The ‘Cats’ have hardly ever shown enough with the ball even in this past season when they were finding the back of net regularly. There’s no other explanation for the issues I’ve harped on again and again — excessive verticality lack of reliable patterns in all phases especially in the final third against deep blocks — than the in-possession game model being the problem. Payne has shown a lot of willingness to adapt the attacking structure but simply altering the positions of players doesn’t make these issues go away. The behavior and decision-making of the individuals within the collective organization must improve and the continuous reliance on transitions and set pieces just isn’t enough to consistently win games. The roster is very thin in attack and lacking experience. Not only are there strategic questions to be answered at this end of the pitch but there are personnel ones too. The presumptive losses of Weiss and Ugo Achara mean the front three currently consists of Tyler Glassberg Thaggard and Paul Son which produced a combined five goals and assists this past season. For a team that struggled as much in possession as this one did with a goal machine like Weiss I can only imagine what the forward group will look like without him. In short the 2024 version of this outfit is shaping up to be a more extreme version of the 2023 group. The defense will only get stronger and the attack is primed to see some regression. Granted a few high quality transfers could alter that calculus but the Wildcats’ identity is not changing. Ultimately if there isn’t discernible improvement in Northwestern’s possession play next season I’m going to start developing serious concerns about the long-term trajectory of this program under Payne. Relying on having a Weiss-level forward to get the requisite level of production from the attack just isn’t realistic sustainable or optimal. The results are always important but my primary goal in 2024 is for the ‘Cats to start looking like a team that wants the ball wants to dominate the ball and wants to control the game. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story A special announcement calls for a special edition of David Braun transcripts! Braun Michael Schill and Derrick Gragg made statements and spoke to media members yesterday in a press conference where Gragg and Schill introduced Braun as Northwestern’s 30th full-time head football coach. Here’s what everyone had to say in a ceremony that included a video Willie the Wildcat and even the marching band: Northwestern President Michael Schill’s opening statement: “Thank you all for being here today. I am so happy to be celebrating the news that all of you have seen by now that effective immediately former interim head coach David Braun will become the Dan and Susan Jones Head Football Coach of the Northwestern Wildcats. ""“Now I have been lucky to spend some time getting to know David personally over the past few months since he took over under incredibly challenging situations and conditions. I’ve walked away from each of our conversations incredibly impressed with his poise his thoughtfulness his passion and most importantly his deep commitment to the student-athletes that he coaches. I have been very clear that at Northwestern the well-being of our students comes first. It is only by prioritizing our students health safety and well being that we can enable excellence on the field excellence in the classroom that we can encourage the personal and intellectual growth that is fundamental to our mission as one of the greatest universities in the world and anyone who has heard or talked with Coach Braun knows that he embodies these principles in just a short time since arriving at Northwestern as defensive coordinator earlier this year and then as interim coach this July. "" “He has shown what it means to be a leader by acting as a resource for his student-athletes by modeling incredible humility and also by showing them that he is here to support them to support you in every phase of your development and all of the way. Now a Big Ten football coach is under a magnifying glass in the best of times but Dave came into a particularly difficult situation and he never wavered in his focus and he never wavered in his commitment to you. I think many of us in this room and those observing from afar we went into this football season with tempered expectations. I was at Rutgers for the season opener although we weren’t able to come away with the win. I could tell that Coach Braun had lit a spark under our student-athletes. ""“The coach’s job is to bring out the best in players and Dave has gone above and beyond in that respect. We sit here today 5-5 demonstrating to our conference the entire football world and really the entire world that Wildcats don’t back down from a challenge. The decision to remove the tag from Daves title was not just about the results on the playing field but the way in which he and our team have achieved them. In the face of adversity he has set an example for all of us that living our values as a university is a successful pathway to success by any standard. Dave I’m so proud to have you as part of the Wildcat family and I’m so proud of what our football team or great student-athletes have accomplished this season. "" “Now what I’d like to do is hand the mic over to Vice President for Athletics and Recreation Dr. Derrick Gragg but before I do so he deserves a big thank you as well. Derrick played an integral role in bringing Coach Braun to Northwestern in the first place as well as in the decision that we are announcing today. Not only that but Derrick has been overseeing the athletic department that continues to deliver excellence in sport after sport this season. Thank you Derrick and welcome head coach David Braun.” Northwestern athletic director Dr. Derrick Gragg’s opening statement: “Thank you President Schill and this is certainly a great day to be a Wildcat. It’s truly an honor to be here today to recognize this special coach. But before we get to the man of the hour I want to thank a few important people. Starting with Coach Braun’s family: his wife Kristin their boys Lucas and Andrew and daughter Blake are here in the front row let’s give a round of applause to them please.  “There are many of us who have been involved in athletics our entire lives and we know that this is a nonstop 24/7 365-day assignment so the sacrifices that our families make are immeasurable. So thank you to everyone. I thank our current football student-athletes a lot of them are here today. Two weeks ago when I met with many of the members of the team to discuss the coaching process that we’re going through the search process I told them that they were turning into one of the biggest stories in college athletics and I think you’ll agree with me on that they’ve done an incredible job. I lost my coach going into my senior year I’ve told them this and that pales in comparison to what they’ve gone through so I appreciate them and I commend them. I know they have a lot more work to do over the next couple of weeks but we are with you guys and we appreciate you.  “I want to thank the football coaches and the staff in particular. Even with all the uncertainty of the past few months they locked in with our student-athletes when they could have thrown in the towel very easily and they continue to help our program continue to improve week after week. I also want to thank the trustee advisory committee who helped vet candidates during the search process and also thank Glenn Sugiyama who’s here from DHR International search. He scoured the country to bring us some of the best candidates for this position and a lot of people were interested but we landed in the right spot. “I myself had the privilege of playing college football on this level and also had the privilege to help my wife Sonya raise a division one football student-athlete so I understand the expectations of the families the parents in particular who bring their 17 and 18-year-olds to us. So when hiring coaches I asked myself would I trust this coach to lead and support my own children? Anyone who’s hired people knows that we don’t always get it right but we certainly got it right this time. As I constantly say successful athletic programs like ours are built on the shoulders in the backs of great coaches and we have many of them here today head and assistant coaches. I appreciate you for being here as well.  ""“We have high expectations for our student-athletes and we talked to them about this in the recruiting process. Number one go to class obtain knowledge graduate. Number two integrate into mainstream campus society and become something other than a ballplayer. Number three train to become champions and we win here. We win here the right way. This past year was one of the best years we had athletically in 15 years overall with the national championship in lacrosse the school’s second-ever men’s basketball NCAA appearance field hockeys second consecutive NCAA championship game appearance and they’re going to play tomorrow in their third straight Final Four the NCAA Sweet 16 women’s soccer team the NCAA championship appearances in men’s and women’s golf cross country and men’s tennis. "" “We also expect our student-athletes to give back to the community especially to the little people who aspire to be like them. We expect them to take advantage of all the support services we have to prepare them to build a meaningful career. Lastly and probably most importantly we expect them to be upstanding students. Citizens who uphold and follow the university Big Ten and NCAA rules and regulations. I definitely feel that Coach Braun embraces and reinforces all of these things. He’s shown tremendous leadership under these adverse circumstances and he embodies the values of our athletics department: which are respect integrity service and excellence.  “Since Coach Braun’s arrival last year I have watched and observed him. I sit upstairs at football games so I can see everything. I don’t like to be on the sidelines I like to watch as a football guy myself. I watch his interaction with the players and the coaches. I look at his body language the body language of the players how the team is reacting to him and everybody else. I listened to his postgame messages to the team in the locker room win or lose. I attend postgame press conferences and I can tell you that without a doubt Coach Braun is a winner on and off the field. The student-athletes have rallied around him. They’ve been supportive both behind the scenes with me but also publicly. I’m going to tell you that we want Braun chant in the locker room after Wisconsin was deafening and as I told them yesterday we want Braun also... Ladies and gentlemen it is my extreme honor and pleasure to officially welcome Coach Braun as the 30th Dan and Susan Jones Family Head Football Coach. Congratulations coach.” Northwestern football head coach David Braun’s opening statement: “Want to start off by thanking a few people. First off to President Schill Dr. Gragg the search committee the Board of Trustees here at Northwestern and Glenn Sugiyama with the DHR Global thank you for believing in me and my family. This is an opportunity that we don’t take lightly. To be honest with you an opportunity that as a young coach could only dreamt of maybe wrap my head around that it would truly be an opportunity and is a credit to your willingness to see beyond maybe what a resume says and then look to what you believe myself and our family can do leaving this group moving forward. So thank you for your belief in me.  Need to not need to I want to thank my wife Kristin our two boys Lucas and Andrew and our little girl Blake. Thank you for not just the last few months but for the last 10 years. All of us in the room that are coaches understand all of us involved in athletics understand that being a coach’s wife being a coach’s family is something that is not easy and requires a great deal of sacrifice. When this transition occurred over the course of the summer months I’m looking at my wife eight months pregnant little girl soon to be arriving and we talk as a team all the time about not flinching Kristin Braun never flinched. Kristin Braun continues to be the rock that I’ve known her to be the entire time I’ve known her. There’s no way that we do this as a family without you. So thank you. “Thank you to our players. Words won’t do it justice. Words won’t do a justice. I was fortunate to coach at North Dakota State for a long time and work with an incredible group of young men. To be honest with you one of the hardest things about leaving Fargo was leaving that group of people. I didn’t know what it would be like showing up at a Big Ten institution at a place that has a tremendous tradition and something that I had admired from afar for a long long time but I immediately was blown away with the quality of young men that make up this program. The relationships that you’ve allowed us to build is something that I absolutely cherish.  “I’ll be very clear. Myself and our family know that the opportunity that exists for our family only exists because of you guys and your willingness to buy in and galvanize and come together and really embody what this football program is all about. You’ve done that from day one in July throughout the remainder of our summer workouts into fall camp and never once cared what anyone on the outside said about you. You just continued to believe in yourself as individuals yourself collectively continued to battle and as we all know the mission mission isn’t done yet. We got a lot of work to do. Got a lot of work to do and there’s no other group in the country that I’d rather be doing. So thank you. “I want to thank our coaches our staff our support staff our athletic department other coaches within this athletic department and program. Character is revealed in difficult times. I’ve been fortunate to be a part of the staff that got let go. We went out when I was at UC Davis I’ve been fortunate enough to be part of staffs that have won conference championships national championships reached the so-called pinnacle of the season. You quickly realize that true character is revealed in the hard times. I want to speak to our coaches our staff and thank them for the way that they’ve navigated all this. They’ve rooted back into their purpose. Their purpose being the young men that sit here today our team. They poured themselves into these guys they’ve coached them hard they’ve mentored them they’ve been there for them and it’s pretty neat to see the byproduct of that showing up on the field every Saturday. So thank you to our staff coaches and everyone in the athletic department. “There’s a really neat opportunity for this football program moving forward. We won’t get too much into that today because all I really care about honestly is having a great Thursday and beating Purdue. But the Big Ten is evolving. College football is evolving so you better know who you are you better know who you are as a university you better know who you are as an athletic department you better know who we are as a football program.  ""“The thing that I’ll tell you is we will prioritize the student-athlete experience. First and foremost and every decision we make the question will be asked well how does this affect the young men that are part of our program? Secondly we’re gonna route into and double down on being a developmental program. Don’t you care how many stars he has next to his name. We want to find out does he value a Northwestern degree and what that brings not only to his short-term but what that brings to his opportunities four years 40 years down the road. What’s his character? What’s his competitive spirit? Is he a team-first guy? Does he model so many things that this group models every single day? Then we’re gonna do everything in our power to ensure that we provide the resources the coaches whatever it may be the mentorship to ensure that the young men that decided to come to Northwestern decide to continue to be a part of Northwestern football have the opportunity to reach their full potential. When they reach their full potential holistically academically socially physically athletically spiritually amazing things happen. The wins naturally come we can sit up here and talk about winning Big Ten championships all we want but if we don’t do the little things in recruiting the right young me to our program and then put into place the things that we need to do every single day to achieve those goals then theyre just words. Again you want to talk about the character of a team all you got to do is look at this group right now."" “That’s been part of this institution for a long long time and a part of this football program for a long long time. Recruiting high-character young men that value a Northwestern degree that love to compete at the highest level of college football. So excited for what that has the ability to do in differentiating ourselves moving forward. In a changing college football landscape we have the opportunity to route right back into that and out-team everybody in the country. You can see it tangibly right now. That’s going on with his team and I can’t wait for that process to continue.  “And then lastly the commitment that I’ll make to everyone within our program and it’s the same commitment that I made months ago given an opportunity to take over this role in the interim basis. If anything these last few months have clarified for Kristin and me is why we do what we do. We got into this to to have a positive impact on young people. So moving forward I’m here to support our student athletes. We’re here to serve our student athletes. And we’re here to push them to be the absolute best that they can be.  “Now on to the important stuff. We’re guaranteed two more opportunities. So as much as there’ll be some questions to answer I can’t wait to get off of this stage get back to work with this staff get back to work with this group of young men and make sure that we are at our absolute best at 11 o’clock on Saturday to make sure we accomplish the mission that this group set out to do months ago. Thank you. Go ‘Cats.” Braun on having the players’ support: “Dave [Eanet] you’re gonna make me emotional with this question man. The support from our guys means it’s why we do what we do for these guys. For them to show that support and it wasn’t just in the locker room after Madison the way that these guys have showed up every single day. I remember an opportunity back in July where voices were heard in terms of guys speaking up and to know that they believe in me they believe in this staff they believe in what we’re doing means everything to me means everything to our family. Braun on celebrating being named head coach on a Wednesday during a game week: “In terms of a Wednesday celebrating there honestly wasn’t much celebration other than getting ready for Purdue. But there are certainly moments back at home with Kristen and the boys. I think the biggest celebration came from Lucas and Andrew. ‘So dad this means we’re not moving.’ Yeah guys we’re not moving. Our family loves it here. We’re honored to be a part of this community and excited for all that’s ahead.” Braun on when he knew he wanted to be HC: “To be honest with you there was so much going on back in July. There were conversations with our administration. I think it started off with would you have interest Dave and I said absolutely. An opportunity to lead this group would be something that I’d be honored to do. Don’t know if it was something I was excited about. There’s a lot of emotions going on at that time but honored to have an opportunity to be with these guys.  “The thing that I’ve learned is being a head coach there’s this tremendous opportunity to have an impact on everyone within the program our student athletes our staff. Sometimes you miss the X’s and O’s sometimes you don’t look forward to the administrative things that you’re navigating but our support staff has done such a tremendous job of taking some of those things off my plate allowing me to route into football and spend time with our guys. I think there was a moment even in fall camp where it was it started to click for me that the opportunity to be a head coach is something that is not to take lightly and something that I look forward to at some point not knowing when that opportunity would come.” Braun on moment he realized he would be head coach: “I don’t know. That’s a great question. The thing that I committed myself to our family committed ourselves to that we’re just going to move in a way that we’re going to make decisions that we’re going to put our student-athletes at the forefront of every decision we made. When there’s talk of potentially having an opportunity to become the long-term head coach it can be really easy to allow yourself to go to this space of what decisions do I need to make to get this job.  “That’s something that I think my wife and I were very intentional about making sure that we didn’t let our minds go to that place. So call me call me crazy call me stubborn but it was like wake up each morning and what do I need to do today to help this team get ready for the next game and tune out all the noise? It honestly probably didn’t become a reality mid-week this week when all of a sudden it started to become real the conversations that I was having.” Gragg on the hiring process: “Coach Braun has basically been interviewing for this job every week. We’ve all seen it the growth on and off the field the way he’s handled himself and not to dwell too much on July but none of us have experienced anything like this and I’ve been doing this for 30 years. So just the way that he’s led the program kept it together and then the results started to come.  “We’ve had many conversations the President and myself and we got to a point to where we wanted to start talking about relieving the pressure of what coach is mentioning. We don’t want the guys to feel like they had to win a certain number of games to get to a certain threshold. So we’ve been talking about this all season. He’s had a great deal of support not just from us but a lot of people. You don’t make these decisions alone. I made the decision but I had a lot of people to consult with and what feels good about this decision is 100% of the people that we’ve been dealing with are behind us on this. Braun on NIL: “I think there’s in the world of the transfer portal things are just so different. Some of the questions of what that looks like institutionally and how we navigate that. The Ryan family has been incredible just expressing their support unwavering support and moving forward with their presence around our program their support for our program their support for our student-athletes. Even before the conversations got serious even going back to August the support from the Ryan family has been really impressive. I think what we need to continue to look at again we need to be the ultimate developmental program in the country and then we need to do a great job of retaining our student-athletes.  “Why do you come to Northwestern? For an opportunity to earn a world-class degree that will change the rest of your life. In the world of NIL and the transfer portal we need to do a great job of recruiting young men that fit our profile and are great fits here at Northwestern. That want to compete and want to play their best football at Northwestern before whatever the outlook looks like post-Northwestern. There needs to be conversations on what that looks like and an ever-changing landscape of NIL and the transfer portal. As a coach you can’t be involved in NIL but I feel very confident that there’s an alignment within the Northwestern community and within our athletic department and those stakeholders that are involved to make sure that we do just that.  “We recruit high-quality student-athletes that are great fits for Northwestern we do a phenomenal job of helping those student-athletes develop to their absolute best holistically and then we have things in place to ensure that we retain those young men to be a part of our program and and play their best football while earning their degree at Northwestern.” Braun on if being a head coach was always a career goal: “I wanted to be a head coach of a Big Ten institution. I mean that was my dream. As a young coach I probably spent too much time chasing the dream rather than just really rooting into what’s my purpose? Why am I doing this? Why as a family are we doing this? Once you start to realize then one of the greatest gifts I’ve ever earned is an opportunity to win a national championship in North Dakota State. What you learned through that yes euphoric. I mean incredible. Hope to experience it again don’t get me wrong but you quickly realize that three days after that experience it’s not like all is right with the world.  “It’s not like you’re all of the sudden fulfilled completely. You better know your purpose and I think I’ve become a better coach. The opportunities that have been provided to myself and my family have been a result of just walking in purpose operating in purpose and knowing why we’re doing what we’re doing. So to be doing this this was the dream there’s no doubt about it. It’s still surreal. It probably won’t completely sink in for a long long time. But whether you’re doing this at Northwestern or Culver-Stockton College when you decide to coach college football you have an incredible opportunity to have a positive impact on young people. When I got that figured out I think that’s where I started to become my best.” Braun on what he’s learned about himself: “I don’t know what I’ve learned about myself. You’d have to ask Kristin. The guys our coaches they can probably give you a better answer. What I can tell you is I’m at my best when I’m rooted in my purpose when I’m rooted in my faith when I’m staying prayed up. When I know who I ultimately answered to and that’s my God that’s my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ that’s when I’m at my best. Walking in freedom. It’s hard to find that time to read into that when there’s a lot going on around but I’ve learned that it’s something that’s critical to my walk for me to be at my best to serve these guys. ""Braun on what a David Braun program looks like: “I think we’ve had a similar conversation about the defense when I first arrived here and now I’ll come back to a similar answer. It’s not about putting my stamp on it. At the end of the day it’s not my program. It’s Northwestern’s program. It’s our players program. I’m gonna walk into this facility each and every day with their best interests at the forefront of my mind. what’s in their best interest right now is making sure that we’re completely focused on Purdue and finishing the mission that this team set out to achieve in those other things long term. "" “Those are things we’ll worry about when we get there. What this team this group of student-athletes this coaching staff the support staff have embodied this year is nothing short of incredibly impressive. It only happens with us being in lockstep and working our tails off together. To answer your question I don’t know. But what I will tell you with conviction is I’m not looking to put my own stamp on it. I’m just looking to make the next right decision that’s in the best interest of our student-athletes.”  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story About a thousand miles away from Ryan Field Northwestern men’s basketball kept the party going. The Wildcats (4-0 0-0 B1G) rode a spectacular defensive start and a balanced scoring attack to a 72-61 victory over Rhode Island (3-1 0-0 A10) at the Hall of Fame Tip-Off Tournament in Uncasville Connecticut. NU advanced to the championship game where it will face Mississippi State at noon CT tomorrow afternoon. Northwestern had three scorers reach double figures. Brooks Barnhizer put up 18 points and nine rebounds on a 5-of-15 shooting mark with Boo Buie adding 16. After playing only 14 minutes against Western Michigan Ty Berry played a crucial role with 13 points and three three-pointers in 34 minutes.  URI also had three scorers reach the 10-point threshold. Zek Montgomery led the Rams with 18 while Cam Estevez and Luis Kortright contributed 15 and 11 points respectively. After a minute of scorelessness Matthew Nicholson drew first blood with a powerful jam off a bounce pass from a driving Ryan Langborg. The big man set the tone for a great defensive start for Northwestern which forced Rhode Island to start just 1-of-8 from the field in the first four minutes. A fastbreak steal-and-score from Buie off a David Fuchs turnover — as well as a three-pointer a few possessions later — gave the Wildcats a 9-2 lead at the under-16. Blake Preston kept the fun going out of the break with a beautiful assist to Langborg who hit a reverse layup off a backdoor cut. The ‘Cats continued to stifle the Rams forcing five more misses and two more turnovers. Barnhizer took one of those to the rim for a fastbreak score and capitalized two Nick Martinelli offensive rebounds on the same possession with a three-pointer as the shot clock expired. It extended Northwestern’s lead to 10-0 giving the Wildcats a 16-2 lead at the under-12. To make things even worse for Rhode Island Berry then caught fire. He drained threes on back-to-back possessions after a few more Rams misses to make it 16 unanswered points for the ‘Cats. Northwestern held its 22-2 lead into the under-eight with the Rams having shot 1-of-19 up to that point. Finally Kortright ended the drought with an and-one layup on Justin Mullins and Montgomery added to URI’s total with another and-one. Both teams traded scores for a few possessions before Rhode Island put a dent into Northwestern’s lead with treys from Montgomery and Estevez which forced Chris Collins to take a timeout with 4:38 left in the first half. URI continued its run with force as Tyson Brown swiftly rejected a Jordan Clayton layup attempt out of the timeout. Jaden House took it the other way feeding Montgomery with a slick bounce pass for the deuce. A free throw by Brown and a layup by Kortright then sandwiched a second-chance Preston layup to cut the Northwestern lead to single digits making it 28-22 with 2:43 to go. Rhode Island only got closer as a Brown interception of a pass from Buie led to two free throws for House. Montgomery drew another foul after snagging an offensive rebound which brought the Rams within four. Barnhizer and Preston quieted the spurt with three free throws and a putback respectively but the half ended on a sour note. Kortright released a contested three with less than a second left but Buie fouled him. The Rhode Island guard drained two of three free throws which cut Northwestern’s lead to 33-26 at the half. After starting 1-of-18 from the field Rhode Island ended the half going 7-of-9. Northwestern was shooting just 35% from the field despite making four of its nine threes and went just 2-of-12 from the field in the final 5:50. The Wildcats were clogging passing lanes and doing well on the glass — securing 12 offensive rebounds — but lost some of the momentum it possessed early on. However the Wildcats came out of the break energized as Barnhizer quickly drained a three after Nicholson blocked a fastbreak layup on the other end. Following a couple misses by both teams Buie and House traded twos before No. 0 responded with a beautiful stepback three. With that Northwestern had increased its lead to 41-28. Before reaching the under-16 Jordan Clayton drew a charge and finished a layup before Montgomery put back his own miss to make it 43-30 NU.  Out of that stoppage layups from Martinelli and Clayton sandwiched an Estevez three. A few possessions later Estevez responded to a Buie floater with another make from deep. Both teams kept adding to the offensive output as Montgomery followed up a midrange stepback jumper from Langborg with another three-pointer. Martinelli answered that bucket with a cutting layup off a Preston assist which kept Northwestern’s lead at a comfortable 53-39 going into the under-12. Again both teams answered each other but then Rhode Island went on another mini-run. Kortright drained another three which Estevez followed up with a steal-and-score off Clayton. Buie briefly quelled the momentum with a driving layup to get to nine points in the second half with more than 10 minutes to go but Jeremy Foumena banked in a three-pointer on the next possession to cut URI’s deficit to 57-48 with 9:22 remaining. Both offenses cooled down after Foumena’s three with pairs of free throws from Buie and Langborg marking the game’s only points in a four-minute span. Montgomery later drew a foul of his own and made both free throws with Kortright nailing two more after Preston threw it out of bounds from the low post. Finally Northwestern put up a field goal. After rebounding his own miss Barnhizer found an open Berry for his third three-pointer of the game to make it 64-52. No. 13 then hit a one-legged fadeaway on the next possession to increase the lead to 14 with 2:18 remaining. From there Langborg put the nail in the coffin with a stepback three-point dagger with 1:57 to go. NU closed the game out without much trouble to move to 4-0 on the year. Tip-off against Mississippi State is set for noon CT and the game will be broadcast on ESPN2. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Despite a mistake-laden affair Northwestern (6-5 4-4 Big Ten) pulled away from Purdue (3-8 2-6 Big Ten) 23-15 courtesy of 17 second-half points. Here were the bright spots and areas to clean up from the Wildcats in their penultimate regular-season game. Stock Up Cam Porter Responsible for the only touchdown of the first half Porter got things going early on his senior day trotting in a seven-yard score to cap off Northwestern’s opening 4 play 53-yard drive to take an early lead. Later he tacked on a 34-yard score making him the first NU player with two rushing touchdowns since Evan Hull in September 2021. Though the offense struggled to capitalize Porter remained productive averaging 5.6 yards per carry on the day and ending with 95 yards on the ground. As the Wildcats move into their last game of the year Porter’s impact as a focal point of the up-and-down offense will be key to determining just how much of a success this surprising season will be for David Braun and Co. Pass Rush Though many will focus on the lackluster scoring from both of these offenses in this game give credit to both Purdue and Northwestern’s respective defenses especially in getting pressure. The two defensive units combined for three sacks and eight tackles for loss.  The pass rush was especially effective for Northwestern when it came to the passing game as they effectively shut down Ryan Browne and Bennett Meredith who combined for 136 yards through the air and two interceptions.  4th-Down Defense The “bend-don’t-break” defensive mentality was definitely applied to Northwestern’s defensive effectiveness in the team’s win today as it managed to hold a Purdue squad who outgained Northwestern by 114 yards to just 15 points.  What was especially important for Northwestern’s defense today was its ability to stall Purdue’s drives into Northwestern territory. Despite having 56% of its plays in NU territory Purdue ended with three turnovers on downs two interceptions and a missed field goal. Even though Northwestern wasn’t perfect it made plays when it mattered most and held its own.  Stock Down Contain Defense At first glance it may look like Northwestern’s defense absolutely locked down Purdue’s offense today. While that may be true scoring-wise the Boilermakers actually had a very productive day — until they got into scoring position that is. The Boilers had 443 total yards including 303 on the ground. Even if they only managed to give up 15 points on the day it’s still a major concern for the Wildcats to be yielding over 300 yards rushing.  Big plays were a big part of that Boilermaker success atoo: Purdue had six plays of 20 yards or more breaking down Northwestern’s defense when they got a tempo going. Containing these big plays has to be a point of emphasis for David Braun going forward.  Special Teams Units  Despite the bowl-sealing win Northwestern played far from perfect football today. A big part of that was the repeated mistakes coming from the special teams many of which were easily avoidable. Whether it was the muffed snap on their first extra point try a kickoff out of bounds or A.J. Henning’s near-disastrous fumble the Wildcats have a lot to work on.  After a near-perfect showing against Wisconsin there were a lot of avoidable mistakes from the Wildcat side. Luckily Purdue was never really able to make use of the opportunities given to them but special teams is a must-fix especially after the way the ‘Cats looked today. (Red Zone) Offense In spite of some late offensive scores on the whole the offensive output was nothing short of disappointing from both sides today. Against a defense ranked dead last in the Big Ten in points allowed per game (31.1) in Purdue Ben Bryant and the ‘Cats’ offense simply was not able to churn much out following a dominant first drive.  What was especially discouraging was an inability to capitalize in the red zone. Despite having an average field position of 35 the ‘Cats were unable to put themselves in good position on a consistent basis averaging 8.1 yards to go on third down. Though Northwestern was able to get things done today thanks to a stingy defensive effort the Wildcats will need to take advantage of every major opportunity they get especially during bowl season. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Break out your bowling shoes. For the first time since 2020 Northwestern (6-5 4-4 B1G) is heading to a bowl game after knocking off Purdue (3-8 2-6 B1G) 23-15. While it was only a 6-0 lead at halftime the Wildcats pulled away with 17 second-half points. In his second game back from injury Ben Bryant finished the day 13-for-24 for 230 yards a touchdown and an interception. Cam Johnson hauled in three passes for 88 yards and a touchdown. On the ground Cam Porter added 95 yards and two touchdowns.  Purdue split the game between quarterbacks Ryan Browne and Bennett Meredith. However it was the ground game that anchored the Boilermakers.  As a team PU had 303 rushing yards. Northwestern kicked it off to the Boilermakers to start the game and Tyrone Tracy Jr. ran it out to the 28-yard line. After a short run on first down Jaheem Joseph almost came away with an interception knocking Meredith’s pass away. To close the drive Anto Saka demolished Meredith in the backfield for a sack and the ‘Cats took over at midfield. After a first down run goes nowhere Bryant uncorked a 33-yard pass to A.J. Henning who made a diving toe tap catch along the sideline. Cam Porter followed it up with two straight runs including a seven-yard scamper into the end zone to put NU up 6-0 with a bad snap dooming the extra point.  The Boilermakers kept it all on the ground on their next drive. Devin Mockobee picked up 13 on an inside handoff and Tracy added 28-yards on a jet sweep to get inside NU territory. However Carmine Bastone got into the backfield and jarred the ball loose from Ryan Browne pushing Purdue out of field goal range. Browne was able to get PU back in field goal territory but the kick fell well short and the ‘Cats took back over up 6-0. After the Wildcats got the ball back they faced a third-and-5. With the pressure all on Bryant the QB flipped it out to Porter for a fresh set of downs. However the Wildcats stalled out after Cam Johnson dropped a wide-open deep ball from Bryant. A clean pass breakup by Purdue forced NU to punt. Tracy started Purdue’s drive by bouncing a run outside for 17 yards. He picked up another 28 yards through a gaping hole to put the Boilermakers inside Northwestern territory. Mockobee churned his legs for another first down as the ‘Cats struggled to bring down Purdue’s backfield tandem. Despite a third-and-long Meredith nearly picked up a first down on a scramble and Mockobee punched it forward for a fresh set of downs as the clock expired in the first quarter. As the teams flopped sides NU clung to a 6-0 lead. To start the second quarter Purdue was ruled just short of the line to gain on second down and the ‘Cats stopped all momentum there. On third down Aidan Hubbard blew up a handoff in the backfield setting up a forth-and-short. The Boilermakers decided to keep the offense on the field but Xander Mueller shot the gap perfectly and laid out Tracy well short of the line to gain and the Wildcats took over on downs. NU could not get anything going on offense. After a holding penalty pushed the Wildcats back 10 yards Bryant was put on his back two times and the ‘Cats had to punt. It turned from bad to worse when Hunter Renner shanked a punt setting up Purdue at Northwestern’s own 31-yard line. Despite the short field the ‘Cats held once again. Purdue worked the ball all the way to the half-yard line following QB runs but was unable to punch it in. The Wildcats had three straight goal-line stops including a fourth-down tackle by Bryce Gallagher to hand the ball back to the offense. Out of its own end zone Bryant found Bryce Kirtz on a deep crosser for a 29-yard gain. However the ‘Cats had to punt once again and Purdue took over at its own 31. ""Purdue once again moved the ball easily down the field but a bad exchange allowed the ball to hit the turf and NU fell on it for a recovery. Back on offense Bryant hit Kirtz in stride for a 28-yard third down conversion. However on the ensuing play Bryant was walloped by a blindside rusher. It didn’t get any better as another Purdue sack forced NU out of field goal range. But Renner’s punt was down inside the 2 and Hollis intercepted Browne at the Boilermakers 20-yard line. However the offense could not do anything and Jack Olsen’s 38-yard kick went wide right sending NU headed into the locker room up 6-0."" Out of the halftime break a holding penalty set NU back 10 yards and the ‘Cats were unable to overcome the foul punting the ball once again. However the Boilermakers went three-and-out on their first possession too. On Northwestern’s next sequence Bryant found  Henning for a third down conversion. Despite having to punt Renner’s sky-high punt could not be corralled by Purdue’s T.J. Sheffield and Greyson Metz recovered the muff at the Boilermakers’ 21-yard line. Yet the NU offense was not able to find the end zone but Olsen converted the 30-yard attempt to expand the ‘Cats’ lead to 9-0. On Purdue’s next drive Browne split the coverage and found Mockobee down the seam for a 25-yard gain once again reaching ‘Cats territory. On third-and-short Mockobee hurdles his way to a 14-yard gain reaching the red zone. A few plays later Tracy walked into the end zone to cut the Wildcats’ lead to 9-7 with four minutes left in the third quarter. The ‘Cats picked up a first down on a screen to Joseph Himon. A few plays later Bryant flipped it out to a wide-open Cam Johnson and No. 14 did the rest. The sixth-year pass catcher shook a defender and ran it all the way into the end zone for a 52-yard touchdown pushing NU’s lead back to two scores. On the ensuing drive Purdue went three-and-out sending the ball right back to the Wildcats to close out the third quarter. With one frame remaining Northwestern held on to a 16-7 lead. On the first drive in the final quarter Johnson climbed the ladder for a 25-yard third-down catch. Porter picked up a first down on two straight runs and NU inched closer to field goal range. However on the next set of downs Porter ran untouched for a 34-yard score giving Northwestern a 23-7 lead with 12:08 left in the game. On the back of Mockobee and Tracy the Boilermakers found themselves in Northwestern territory again. However like the rest of the game the Wildcats’ defense did not break. The ‘Cats forced another turnover on downs thanks to a nice pass breakup by Theran Johnson. With 7:49 left in the game this one was getting late early. After it appeared the ‘Cats had to punt an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty gifted NU a fresh set of downs; however the penalty was null as Bryant threw a deep interception on the next play to Dillon Thieneman.  The Boilermakers did not go away quietly. Tracy took a handoff 62 yards down to NU’s 8-yard line. However the defense stood on its head one more time making three straight stops to bring up a fourth-and-goal from the two. On fourth down Purdue finally punched it in on a toss to Mockobee and converted the two-point try on a reverse from Deion Burks cutting NU’s lead to 23-15. The ‘Cats had to punt the ball away and Purdue got the ball with 1:59 left to play. The Boilermakers picked up a first down with 1:34 left to play and crossed midfield with 1:13 to go. On second down Heard delivered a massive shot to Tracy who required medical attention. Because the Boilermakers were out of timeouts the injury required a 10-second run off leaving 28 seconds for Purdue to go 34 yards. However on third down Xander Mueller called game intercepting Browne and securing the ‘Cats’ 23-15 victory.

They’ll look to clean some things up on their first road trip of the season. Share this story Northwestern (3-0 0-0 B1G) will take on Rhode Island this Saturday in the Hall of Fame Tip-Off Tournament in Uncasville Connecticut. Coming off a hard-fought and fairly concerning victory at home against Western Michigan on Tuesday the ‘Cats will look to bounce back and advance in the tournament to take on either Washington State or Mississippi State on Sunday in the final. If they were to lose they would still play on Sunday against the loser on the other side of the bracket. Here are a few things at stake for Northwestern as it embarks on its first road trip of the young season: Proving it can win against a good Power Five opponent If Northwestern gets past Rhode Island the team will likely get a chance to take on Mississippi State a team that is currently 22nd in the KenPom rankings. That is far above Northwestern which sits at 57. The ‘Cats certainly can beat the Bulldogs especially at a neutral site that doesn’t benefit either team but it would be by far their toughest matchup of the season. But the way the ‘Cats have looked they might need a difficult game to really get them going. After the Western Michigan contest which came down to the final minutes head coach Chris Collins and team captains Boo Buie and Brooks Barnhizer preached that it was up to them to wash it and move on to play better basketball this weekend. What better chance to prove it than in a game in which they will be true underdogs? An early win against a good team can’t hurt come March either. The issue will be on offense. Mississippi State is a dogged defensive team capable of making it very difficult for an out of sync offensive team to put the ball in the bucket. And that is exactly what Northwestern was on Tuesday night at Welsh Ryan: out of sync. Bully ball with Barnhizer isn’t going to work as the only plan of action against the Bulldogs. Northwestern will need some of its complementary scorers besides him and Buie to step up. Showing more toughness and physicality This doesn’t necessarily relate to the tournament but it’s still what ‘Cats fans will be watching for as soon as it tips off. Northwestern must rebound (literally) from a physicality perspective. The Broncos completely out-hustled outran and out-bodied Northwestern on Tuesday and it was the primary reason the game was so close. The ‘Cats were out-rebounded by a whopping margin of 43 to 21. Yeesh. It was very very bad and incredibly obvious to the eye. The Broncos’ 17 offensive boards (to NU’s four) were almost the difference in the game. Northwestern continued to give Western Michigan second and third chances on trips down the floor throughout the entire 40 minutes. Obviously that cannot be the case this weekend. These teams are all better than Western Michigan and all have athletes capable of doing exactly the same thing that the Broncos did. The ‘Cats must step it up from a physicality standpoint. It starts with the bigs but it extends to everybody else too. An improved team effort on the glass would assuage a large concern after the game on Tuesday. Proving that someone other than Buie Barnhizer and Ryan Langborg can step up Langborg had a dreadful evening shooting the basketball on Tuesday as he went just 2-of-9 from the field but he still finished as the third leading scorer for Northwestern with just six points. Barnhizer had 20 and Buie had 21. So far those guys have been the entire offense for the ‘Cats. But maybe going on the road after what must have been a tough week at practice will help get at least somebody else going. Northwestern needs it. A more balanced scoring attack gives them a way better shot against a team with the defensive prowess of Mississippi St. Also long-term the current state of things is not sustainable in Big Ten play. Ty Berry. Matt Nicholson. Nick Martinelli. It would be great if any of those guys ticked up in production this weekend. Northwestern can probably get by Rhode Island without them playing well but it will be much more difficult to come out of Connecticut with a perfect record if they don’t show up at all. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story On Oct. 5 2013 the No. 4 Ohio State Buckeyes marched into Ryan Field in one of the most anticipated games in Evanston’s history. The ‘Cats ranked No. 16 in the country were hosting not only their conference rival but ESPN’s College Gameday crew ahead of a primetime ABC game with Brent Musburger and Kirk Herbstreit on the call. On that evening Ryan Field was over its 47130 capacity. As any diehard Northwestern fan knows all too well the ‘Cats played admirably that Saturday night keeping up with the Buckeyes and even possessing a fourth quarter lead but the team came up short after a questionable spot on a Kain Colter fourth-down sneak. Ohio State emerged victorious 40-30. I along with 47329 others was there that night. To be honest I don’t really remember any of the fanfare or even the final score. I was 9 years old and here is a complete list of the things I do remember from that October evening: A little bit over 10 years later Northwestern is suiting up to play its (likely) final game at this iteration of Ryan Field. Even without the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia the stadium still represents something deeply important to me and thousands of other Northwestern fans. The past few seasons have made it difficult to imagine Ryan Field exceeding its capacity. Heck even 75% of butts in seats would make me pretty happy. The stadium isn’t spectacular by any means — it lacks the grandeur of the Big House the scenery of the Rose Bowl or the tradition of Camp Randall — but there’s still something undeniably charming about those two towers and Saturday afternoons at Ryan Field. Opened in 1926 the venue was originally called Dyche Stadium named after Evanston mayor William Dyche who oversaw the project. Back in the day it was one of the nicest stadiums in all of college football. Within a decade of its arrival Dyche Stadium had hosted three different Big Ten champion Northwestern squads. Shortly after it became the place to see phenom quarterback Otto Graham as he dazzled his way to a third-place finish in the Heisman race in 1943 the springboard for a career that would see him enshrined in both the College and Pro Football Hall of Fames. Fast forward through the rest of the 1940s 50s 60s and 70s which mostly featured a lot of losing (save for the 1948 Rose Bowl a handful of seasons under Ara Parseghian and 1970-1972) and that’s where I re-enter the story. Not me directly — I mentioned I was 9 in 2013 so you can do the math there — but my uncle who arrived on campus in the fall of 1982. At this point Dyche Stadium had mostly become associated with pain and losing. On the heels of an NCAA record 34-game losing streak the ‘Cats welcomed Northern Illinois to Evanston with my uncle in attendance for his first ever game as a Northwestern student. The Wildcats escaped football damnation enjoying the sweet taste of victory for the first time in 1106 days. Naturally the students stormed the field. My uncle says he will never forget that day as a crowd of students ripped the goalposts out of the ground carried them up the bleachers and dropped them several stories down onto the pavement next to Dyche Stadium. Central Avenue filled up with students who picked up the posts and carried them down the street (mind you not a short walk nor a light piece of luggage) and into Lake Michigan completing the act now iconically known as “laking the posts.” The Wildcats won again that same season two weeks later against Minnesota and again the students stormed the field and chucked another $3000 goalpost into the water. After that additional protection was added to the uprights and a police presence was enforced.  Seven years later my parents would arrive on campus meet each other on the first day of freshman year in Allison Hall and eventually fall in love. In the early nineties the team stank once again so my parents’ best football memories from their time on campus are of throwing marshmallows. I’m not joking. Back in the day to provide the entertainment the football team could not students would fling marshmallows and try to land them in the band’s tubas. Before games students would buy bags of marshmallows and instead of making s’mores would participate in this absurd tradition. Eventually this practice was banned at Dyche Stadium and my parents even remember marshmallow sales were prohibited on Fridays and Saturdays in Evanston in an attempt to halt students’ efforts. Despite the losing like any good Northwestern fans would my parents raised me in purple. In the time between their graduation and my arrival Dyche Stadium had been renamed to Ryan Field and the venue had served host to critical Northwestern wins during the 1995 1996 and 2000 seasons campaigns that still mean a great deal to Wildcat fans across the country. I went to a handful of games growing up but it wasn’t until that Ohio State game in 2013 that I began to truly fall in love with football. I almost immediately recognized Trevor Siemian as a football god eventually to be replaced by the shrine of Justin Jackson. Crucial home wins in 2017 and 2018 helped provide some of my best sports memories as a kid culminating in a trip to the Holiday Bowl in San Diego where my whole family traveled to enjoy a New Year’s Eve comeback victory in the rain — a memory I’ll have forever. In 2020 I (and everybody else) watched from our couches as a 4-0 record at Ryan Field fueled the Wildcats to the conference title game in the pandemic-shortened season a much-needed distraction from the craziness in the world. It all came full circle when last fall I ran across the grass at Ryan Field partaking in the freshman tradition of the Wildcat Dash. Now at my dream school as a student this was a poetic moment after years of Northwestern fandom. My trot down the sideline was a leisurely one — nothing like the way Jackson sprinted the field during his time in Evanston. Ryan Field imperfect and mostly empty was now part of my home and I’ll always have a place in my heart for its vintage vibe and homey atmosphere. For me and ‘Cats fans everywhere tomorrow marks goodbye to a venue that has been with Northwestern through thick and thin: miraculous wins heartbreaking losses and goalpost thievings running the gamut of human emotions. If everything goes according to plan those emotions will be on full display Saturday — a mixture of elation from victory with verklempt bittersweetness from bidding adieu to Ryan Field. It’ll be weird when the ‘Cats are playing at an offsite location in the next few seasons and even weirder when Northwestern moves into the high-tech spaceship slated to come to the shores of Lake Michigan in 2026. But in the meantime there’s only one thing to focus on: giving Ryan Field a proper send-off by securing a victory over Purdue to clinch bowl eligibility.  Here’s to hoping storybook endings do come true. Please feel free to leave some of your favorite memories from Ryan Field (or Dyche Stadium) in the comments.

Share this story A whole lot of emotion will funnel into Northwestern’s last home game of the year — which comes on Senior Day with a newly instituted head coach and with bowl eligibility on the line. Can the Wildcats meet the challenge and finally win two games in a row? Our staffers weigh in. Iggy Dowling: Purdue 16 Northwestern 10 This isn’t grounded in logic whatsoever because all logic is just out the window now. This alternating series of results knows no bounds and Northwestern will find some way to play a weird game that will send off Ryan Field in a way more fitting than anyone can possibly dream up. Bradley Locker: Northwestern 33 Purdue 20 Iggy is right about the completely bizarre phenomenon of Northwestern’s alternating win-loss streak. But every curse has its remedy: NU’s last winning streak involved the team beating Purdue in 2020 so this Saturday could very well be the garlic clove. From a football standpoint the Wildcats’ offense should hum pretty well against a defense surrendering almost 400 yards per game and 31.1 points per game. If Northwestern’s D contains Devin Mockobee and Tyrone Tracy Jr. I think a catalyzed bunch wins its sixth game under David Braun and closes old Ryan Field with a note of happiness. David Gold: Northwestern 31 Purdue 17 While there is some black magic going on with Northwestern’s alternating win-loss streak I think the ‘Cats snap this streak just like they snapped their near-1100-day road losing streak. With Ben Bryant back under center the Wildcats are going to air it out against a Boilermakers that allow a Big Ten worst 245 passing yards a game. While I think Devin Mockobee and Tyrone Tracy Jr. will get going for Purdue I feel the ‘Cats’ passing attack will be too much for the Boilermakers to handle. Ethan Segall: Northwestern 24 Purdue 14 Why is Purdue favored by three points? I genuinely can’t figure it out. This Northwestern defense is absolutely humming right now and Purdue’s defense has allowed 30 or more in four straight. Not to mention it’s Northwestern’s senior day and there should be some extra juice in the home locker room with the chance to become bowl eligible. I think Ben Bryant gets it done against a team that is last in the Big Ten in scoring defense sending Ryan Field off the right way and locking Northwestern into a December bowl game. Miguel Muñoz: Northwestern 20 Purdue 17 I hope I won’t be biting my tongue come Saturday but give me the ‘Cats. Although many might be expecting a major letdown in our final home game of the season Northwestern looks like a revitalized team after that major win over Wisconsin in Madison. With Ben Bryant finally back the offensive woes which have plagued Northwestern for much of their season will be much less of a concern especially against a 3-7 Purdue team that’s giving up the most points per game in the Big Ten (31.1). We’re going bowling! Ashleigh Provoost: Northwestern 24 Purdue 20 Northwestern is playing a conference matchup against a team with a worse overall record. That hasn’t happened in a while. Oh and Braun’s interim tag was just removed. I just have one thing to say: bring on the bowl. Ascher Levin: Northwestern 24 Purdue 17 Following a dominant performance against Wisconsin the ‘Cats return home for Senior Day against Purdue. The Boilermakers are coming off their best offensive performance of the season putting up 49 points against Minnesota. However before last week Purdue had lost four games in a row and six of its last seven. PU’s offense is led by quarterback Hudson Card and running back Devin Mockobee. The Boilermakers ran for 353 yards last week so it will be important for Northwestern to stop the run. Offensively with Ben Bryant back the offense looked sensational in the first half last week. Purdue has given up an average of 35.75 points per game in its last four games and Northwestern will look to continue its  momentum on offense. With this most likely being the last game at the old Ryan Field I have the ‘Cats coming out with the win.  Brendan Preisman: Northwestern 23 Purdue 20 Everything seems to be going Northwestern’s way. A dominant road win over Wisconsin David Braun officially becoming head coach and a Purdue team that’s dead last in the Big Ten in scoring defense. And oh yeah it’s probably the last game at the old Ryan Field. Previous Northwestern teams would be primed for a letdown but this year’s iteration feels different. The key to this game will be the Northwestern offensive line: the Wildcats have given up 41 sacks this year last in the conference and Purdue is third in the Big Ten in sacks with 28. If the line can hold up Ben Bryant should have his third straight completed game with over 190 passing yards. The defense which has given up more than 20 points just once since October began will continue that trend and that should be enough to give Northwestern the win. The tag was removed and hopefully Ryan Field’s goalposts will eb as well.

Share this story Welcome back to the film room everybody. The Wildcats could not have had a better game last Saturday in Madison Wisconsin. Northwestern whooped the Badgers 24-10 putting up nearly 300 yards and scoring on every possession in the first half. In fact it was the first time the Badgers have allowed 24 points in the first half at Camp Randall since 2008. Everything went right for NU starting the game 10-for-10 on third down. For the first time in over a month the ‘Cats’ offense was led by Ben Bryant. In his first game back from an upper-body injury the sixth-year looked like he hadn’t lost a step since throwing for almost 400 yards against Minnesota. With the Wildcats’ QB1 back in the lineup let’s take a look at how he fared in Wisconsin. The Stats It was a phenomenal return to action for Northwestern’s starting signal-caller finishing 18-for-26 for 195 yards and two touchdowns also adding a score on the ground. His 69.2% completion rate was his highest as a ‘Cat and Bryant earned a 77.1 PFF passing grade for his efforts. Much like the Minnesota game the grad transfer averaged 7.5 yards per attempt much higher than the 4.1 yards the team averaged the week prior against the Hawkeyes. Despite multiple chunk plays PFF only awarded the sixth-year one big-time throw (a pass with excellent ball location and timing generally thrown further down the field and/or into a tighter window) and said the QB did not have a single turnover-worthy play. In his first game back No. 2 did not have to fret defenders barreling down on him all game. The veteran was only pressured on 29% of his dropbacks the lowest since the ‘Cats beat Minnesota in Week Four. When he was under duress Bryant still managed to throw two touchdowns. Bryant also did a good job beating the Badgers’ blitzes completing 70% of his passes on the 60% of snaps when Wisconsin brought an extra rusher. While Bryant was extremely efficient in the short passing game finishing 14-for-18 when throwing fewer than 10-yards down the field he also pushed the ball long to pick up massive chunks at a time. Bryant completed 75% of his passes of 20+ yards including his two touchdown tosses. Here is a complete breakdown of where No. 2 went with the ball. To be honest I think Bryant played better than the stats could even describe. So let’s dive into the tape to see where NU’s gunslinger thrived. The Good Bryant came back with guns ablaze on Saturday leading NU on four straight nine+-play scoring drives to start the game. Everything was working for No. 2 against the Badgers but here is what really stood out. ""One of the best parts of the veterans game is his ability to stay in the pocket go through his progression and make the smart pass. Even after missing a month those traits shined bright in Madison."" This is gorgeous execution from the ‘Cats. Northwestern runs a levels concept to the three-man side and tags a go route to the backside. The Badgers bring a zone blitz sending five and a pass rusher comes free off the edge. Despite the pressure in his face Bryant’s processing does not speed up and he stays inside the pocket. With Cam Johnson burning the corner off the line of scrimmage with ease Bryant knew where he wanted to go with the ball. He beats the blitzer with the throw and drops one in the bucket for a touchdown. This is a perfect throw from Bryant but it is even more impressive because there is a defender hurtling down at him. His ability to stay in the pocket and allow his receivers to make plays helps the offense stay ahead of the sticks. Nothing like beating a blitz for a score. Much like the play above Wisconsin brings pressure on third down yet Bryant doesn’t fret. The Badgers overwhelm the Wildcats’ offensive line and there is a free rusher coming off the blind side. Northwestern runs a switch concept on the far side of the field and UW fails to cover A.J. Henning on the wheel. Bryant recognizes this and waits for No. 8 to bend the corner. Even with the pressure inching closer NU’s QB does not bail out of the pocket. Instead he stands tall and delivers a strike to Henning. The defender is all but drooped around the veteran’s legs when he releases the ball but he still gets the job done.  This is the part of NU’s offense that has been missing the past few weeks. Much has been made about the offensive line’s poor play. but it was not helped out by its quarterback. Bryant’s ability to remain idle in the pocket and deliver the ball ensures that the ‘Cats’ offense is less volatile. This category has nothing to do with a certain trait Bryant showed against the Badgers more just things that made me cackle in the press box on Saturday. If anyone remembers Peyton Manning’s goal-line TD against the Cowboys I raise you Ben Bryant. This is one of the better ball fakes I’ve ever seen. In fact I was completely fooled from the press box and apparently so was the entire Wisconsin defense. Everyone bit on the handoff to Porter so Bryant was able to waltz into the end zone.  This is something mastered over six years of college football and Bryant was just showing off his skill last Saturday. To be honest there wasn’t any. Bryant played about as clean of a football game as humanly possible. However there is always room to improve. Now the definition of risky is different for everyone but Bryant left a couple of passes available to the defense in Wisconsin. Bryant gets away with one here: trying to throw a slant to Bryce Kirtz yet fully doesn’t see the linebacker dropping into coverage. He is lucky that the ‘backer is just a step too slow; otherwise this ball is picked off for an easy touchdown. Up three scores there is no reason to try and fit the ball in that tight of a window and Bryant is very fortunate that the Badgers could not capitalize. Final Thoughts There is a reason that Bryant has been the ‘Cats’ starter this season. When he is under center Northwestern’s offense is much more consistent because of its viable passing game. Also the running game benefits because teams cannot stack the box. All in all having Bryant taking snaps is exactly what NU needs as it turns its attention to bowl eligibility.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story It seemed inevitable that Northwestern would find itself in a position to win it all. Against Duke in the Final Four that was proven true. What a 2-1 victory and tied game going into the fourth quarter doesn’t display is just how unforgiving the Wildcat offense is and how concrete the defense is. Northwestern totaled 20 shots while limiting Duke to four — just a single shot in each frame.  “I talk about the offense a lot but our defense has been so good this year” head coach Tracey Fuchs said. “Defense starts with the forwards and we thrive on our ability to put pressure on their backs and their midfield. It’s definitely a team effort.” That versatility of being able to constantly push the ball in front of the goal and pressure the Blue Devils kept Duke from ever being able to really dominate possession.  Within the first two minutes graduate student and captain Peyton Halsey fired two shots. Albeit no goal she quickly set the tone of a game that NU would play with urgency.  Duke may have gotten the first corner of the contest but that was also its only one. With a little over two minutes left in the first quarter Northwestern gathered two penalty corners and four goals establishing that it would be unparalleled in opportunities. The 10 corners speak to that. Both of these first-quarter takeaways that have marked NU’s play all season materialized in just minutes of the second frame as first-year Ilse Tromp scored off a penalty corner inserted by graduate student Alia Marshall and stopped by Lauren Hunter.  Headed into halftime it was clear this game was Northwestern’s to lose. It was 1-0 but NU had recorded seven corners and two consecutive quarters with six shots each .  The Blue Devils responded with a goal early on out of the break but the ‘Cats never lost momentum. The score was even but the game was all purple.  “Our team this year has a mentality of there’s gonna be really good opportunities either way” said Marshall who is playing in her fifth NCAA Tournament. “We just know to get back our teammates are gonna pull us together.” It took three minutes into the fourth quarter to demonstrate that team culture.  After a lengthy review of a Northwestern foot requested by Duke first-year Olivia Bent-Cole intercepted a pass and sprinted downfield to assist junior Regan Cornelius who put the ball in the back of the goal The game-winner along with Tromp’s goal spotlights another important feature of this team: the Wildcats aren’t just versatile in terms of offensive and defensive but also in their arsenal of players. The two first-years were — and have been — pivotal in scoring. Marshall drew seven penalty corners. Aside from both being all over the field Halsey and senior Lauren Wadas garnered four and eight shots respectively. The ‘Cats have an offense that will never cease to get shots off and which has the best scoring margin in the country. On top of that they have one of the best defenses in the country headlined by arguably the sport’s best goalie in Annabel Skubisz. Not to mention Northwestern is marked by two first-year phenoms who have made their mark on this offense in addition to postseason-experienced players in Marshall Wadas Halsey and Skubisz among others. Northwestern will play North Carolina for the national title on Sunday. Last year’s championship loss to the Tar Heels will certainly be a topic of discussion especially as North Carolina gained the No. 1 seed after NU was ranked in that spot for four straight weeks.  But Northwestern isn’t scared. Headed into its third consecutive championship appearance Fuchs’ team is no longer the inexperienced postseason squad that it was a few years ago. It’s not in the same position that it was in 2021 making it to the final game for the first time ever. North Carolina field hockey is a dynasty but Northwestern is building one.  All the ‘Cats want is to play on Sunday.  “Not a lot of people get to play in the national championship let alone three in a row” Marshall said. “We’re just excited to get to that stage again.” \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Northwestern had a bit of the Sunday scaries. After being thrashed in South Bend Northwestern (3-1 0-0 B1G) defeated Southeastern Missouri State 76-68. The ‘Cats trailed at the half but were able to pull away in the second half. Walsh led NU with 27 points and 14 rebounds and Melanie Daley aided Walsh with 17 points. Jaliyah Green led the Redhawks with 22 points. The ‘Cats controlled the tip and Paige Mott laid one in to open up the scoring. As the quarter carried on both teams continued to trade buckets but an and-one and ensuing lay-in from Caileigh Walsh gave the ‘Cats a 12-9 lead at the first media timeout. Out of the break Jaliyah Green hit a tough and-one layup but missed the free throw to bring the Redhawks within one. On the other end of the floor Paige Mott took it hard to the rim and earned a foul splitting a pair from the stripe.  Indiya Bowen and Walsh traded threes on the next two possessions and a great steal from Melanie Daley led to a smooth transition bucket from Caroline Lau to extend the ‘Cats lead to four.  Walsh got stuffed at the rim and Michaela Mayfield of the Redhawks hit a midrange jumper in transition to bring the Redhawks within two.  A Maggie Pina triple from the corner capped a 7-0 run for the ‘Cats to close out the first quarter with Northwestern leading 25-16. Joe McKeown’s squad was 3-3 from deep in the first shooting 57% from the field. Bowen kicked off the 2nd quarter with two threes of her own and McKeown responded with a timeout. Bowen’s hot hand had the Redhawks within three. After the break the Redhawks managed to stay hot from downtown and some lackluster perimeter defense from the ‘Cats led to two wide-open triples from Southeast Missouri.  A Paige Mott layup was the only bucket from Northwestern with 5 minutes to play in the 2nd and Jaliyah Green of the Redhawks hit a mid-range jumper in transition and a three from the top of the key to extend Southeast Missouri’s lead to six. Walsh broke the scoring drought for the ‘Cats with a much-needed three of her own to bring Northwestern within one possession. With that triple Walsh brought her first-half total to 16 points but the ‘Cats trailed 33-30.  Green responded with another two of her own and an ill-advised pass from Daley led to yet another Redhawks three to bring their lead to 8 this time from Megan Barton. Barton’s three capped a 16-3 run for Southeast Missouri during a stretch where Northwestern turned the ball over five times. Two Maggie Pina free throws brought the score to 38-32 but Amiyah Buchanan responded with a layup of her own on the other end. Daley hit a mid-range jumper on the ensuing possession breaking a four-and-a-half minute stretch without a field goal for Northwestern.  A seemingly rare missed jumper for Bowen at the buzzer marked the end of a second-quarter the ‘Cats would like to forget. Southeast Missouri outscored Northwestern 24-9 shooting a ridiculous 6 for 11 from downtown and earning a 40-34 lead at the break. The loudest cheers from the Welsh-Ryan faithful did not come after a ‘Cats bucket but instead after saves from Northwestern field hockey’s Annabel Skubisz broadcasted live on the jumbotron as the ‘Cats lost a heartbreaker to North Carolina in the national championship.  Weaver opened the scoring in the second half with a three from the corner and a free throw from Daley on the ensuing possession brought the ‘Cats back within two. McKeown’s squad came out of the half with increased urgency on the defensive end forcing two bad shots and a shot-clock violation from the Redhawks on their first three possessions of the third quarter. Another Daley bucket later and Northwestern once again found themselves even with Southeastern Missouri.. The offensive woes continued for the Redhawks after a timeout as Buchanan turned the ball over on the first possession after the break but the ‘Cats were not able to capitalize on the offensive end. Both teams traded free throws on the next two possessions bringing the score to 42-42 with 7 to play in the third.  Walsh continued to stuff the stat sheet in the third finishing an acrobatic layup after a beautiful pass from Lau and converting two free-throws on back-to-back possessions. Those two buckets gave Northwestern a 46-42 lead their first since early in the second quarter.  After a sloppy slew of possessions for both teams Daejah Richmond got on the scoresheet for the Redhawks with a good finish on a contested layup but Southeastern Missouri continued to have no answer for Daley. She scored eight points in two minutes for the ‘Cats and — supplemented by a three from Lau — Northwestern found themselves with their largest lead of the afternoon with the score at 57-48. Southeastern Missouri called a timeout to slow Northwestern’s momentum. Abigail Stephens drained one from deep out of the break to bring the Redhawks within six but Walsh responded with a layup of her own on the next possession. A foul from the junior put Southeastern Missouri on the line with a second left in the third quater and Richmond converted 1 of 2 from the stripe. Lau’s half-court-heave fell well short but Northwestern had to be happy with that third quarter effort after a lackluster first half. They led 59-52 going into the fourth.  Southeastern Missouri opened the scoring in the fourth quarter with a triple from Green but the ‘Cats were able to respond quickly. Walsh hit a layup on the next possession and grabbed her 10th board of the game after a missed layup from Stephens. A Maggie Pina three later and the ‘Cats led 64-56.  The Redhawks however showed no signs of going away and after a smooth mid-range jumper from Daley extended the ‘Cats lead to 10 Alecia Doyle drained a crucial contested jumper from deep. Walsh picked up her fourth foul on Northwestern’s next defensive possession leaving McKeown with no choice but to take her out of the game. Doyle continued to stay hot for the Redhawks draining a layup and a corner three on consecutive possessions to bring Southeastern Missouri within 2. Walsh checked back in for the ‘Cats after two minutes on the bench with the score at 66-64. Fortunately for Northwestern the Redhawks cooled off with Walsh back in the game missing four straight. Mott hit a layup and Weaver swished a tough jumper from downtown to extend the ‘Cats lead to seven with 2:30 left in the fourth. Southeastern Missouri tried to mount a comeback but Walsh and the ‘Cats proved to be too much for the Redhawks down the stretch closing out a hard-fought 76-68 victory.

Share this story Northwestern couldn’t put it away when it mattered most. Graduate forward Peyton Halsey missed her shot in a sudden-death shootout opening the door for sophomore Ryleigh Heck to cage the game-winning goal for the Tar Heels with a score of 2-1. First-year forward Charly Bruder struck first for North Carolina putting the Tar Heels on the board in the third quarter. While Halsey hit the game-tying goal a few minutes later it was her errant shot that allowed the home team to win their second consecutive championship. The ‘Cats were aggressive from the get-go drawing a penalty corner less than 45 seconds into the game but Halsey sailed the shot wide. For over 10 minutes both teams fought for possession without a shot on goal as each defense held strong. UNC appeared in control for the last five minutes of the frame thanks to its ability to disrupt NU’s passing lanes.  At the end of the quarter neither squad attempted a shot on goal. The ‘Cats and Tar Heels combined for just three total shots in the first 15 minutes. To start the second frame Bruder fired from the top of the circle but couldn’t cage the shot. Wildcat goalie Annabel Skubisz recorded her first save with 11 minutes remaining when graduate midfield Pleun Lammers shot wildly into a crowd of players right in front of the goal. Heck lifted the rebound but first-year Ilse Tromp swat the shot away to back up her goalie.  With just 0.7 seconds left in the half the ‘Cats drew their second corner of the match. Graduate midfield Alia Marshall quickly fired the ball to the top of the circle but NU couldn’t convert its rare chance at the goal.  North Carolina simply dominated possession in the first half intercepting Northwestern’s passes left and right. Though they didn’t attempt a single corner the Tar Heels outshot the ‘Cats six to one.  The ‘Cats looked sluggish entering the second half of action. With 12:37 remaining in the third quarter the Tar Heels drew their first corner of the day. Bruder took a confident swing and fired it past the outstretched arm of Skubisz putting North Carolina up 1-0. NU got another chance with 90 seconds left in the quarter by drawing its third corner. While Tar Heels goalie Maddie Kahn saved Tromp’s shot the ‘Cats managed to draw a penalty stroke. Halsey didn’t let this opportunity pass her by as she fired it past Kahn to tie the game at 1-1.  PEYTON WITH THE EQUALIZER! pic.twitter.com/1AH6AGCBQ0 With less than a minute remaining the ‘Cats were awarded another corner after a lengthy video referral. NU got a redo after Lauren Wadas’s shot hit the foot of North Carolina back Romea Riccardo. This time Kahn saved Tromp’s signature drag flick to keep the game knotted at one goal apiece. Entering the final frame the Tar Heels had an early chance to strike. First-year midfield Sanne Hak intercepted a pass by the ‘Cats but couldn’t capitalize on a running start as she fired wide of the goal.  With 81 seconds to go North Carolina couldn’t have drawn their second corner at a more crucial time. Bruder couldn’t get her shot close to Skubisz as it steered left of the goal. The ‘Cats got the chance to strike on a corner with just over 30 seconds remaining in regulation. Wadas was able to lift the ball past Kahn but the referees determined that her shot was too high. With that missed chance the ‘Cats guaranteed themselves another 10 minutes of field hockey. To begin the overtime period Heck swatted the ball toward the goal but couldn’t get it past Skubisz. The Tar Heels drew a corner with 7:14 remaining but Skubisz saved a shot by junior midfield Jasmina Smolenaars and watched Sietske Bruning’s second-chance attempt sail wide. With five minutes left senior midfield Katie Jones and the ‘Cats streaked down the field but she couldn’t find the angle on her shot. Less than three minutes later the Tar Heels went on a sprint of their own and drew a penalty stroke.  Heck stepped up for North Carolina and tried to lift it past Skubisz but she couldn’t get it past the stick of the incredible goalie. And with that the gassed ‘Cats headed toward double overtime. At the start of 2OT first-year forward Olivia Bent-Cole showed off her speed but couldn’t put the ball near Kahn on her shot. With 6:36 remaining Halsey got called for a green card leaving the ‘Cats to play six-on-seven.  With just over five minutes to go the Tar Heels drew a corner with the chance to win it all. But North Carolina couldn’t find a look they liked ruining a prime opportunity to take home the trophy.  The ‘Cats got out and ran with three minutes left as Bent-Cole and Wadas had just one Tar Heels defender in their path. OBC dished to Wadas who couldn’t get it past a diving Kahn. Just over a minute later Bent-Cole got another great look but sailed it wide once more. NU couldn’t convert its bounty of opportunities before the clock hit zero sending the title game to a shootout.  Heck kicked off the shootout with a goal but Halsey fired back to knot it at one apiece. Bruning fired North Carolina’s second shot wide and Wadas capitalized and found the back of the goal. Skubisz locked up Bruder on the Tar Heels’ third attempt but Lindsey Frank was tripped up on her shot. Tar Heels senior Katie Dixon hit the shot to tie it at two and OBC couldn’t find the proper angle to put the ‘Cats up. Hak stumbled over Skubisz and Regan Cornelius stepped up with the chance to win it all. She lost the ball and recovered it to shoot but couldn’t get it past Kahn. Halsey came back up in sudden death but couldn’t find the goal in a crushing miss. Heck then had her opportunity and fired another goal past Skubisz winning it all for the Tar Heels. It was yet another crushing defeat for the ‘Cats who lost in a similarly devastating fashion last year to North Carolina. But don’t let it be forgotten that Northwestern continues to shape itself as a field hockey powerhouse.         \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Same start different story. Although Northwestern (4-1 0-0 B1G) raced out to a fast start for the second straight day a late run from Mississippi State (5-0 0-0 SEC) put the Wildcats away in a 66-57 loss in the Hall of Fame Tip-Off final in Uncasville Connecticut. Josh Hubbard a freshman erupted against the ‘Cats. He poured in 29 points on 9-of-14 shooting including four threes. The only other Mississippi State scorer in double figures was Dashawn Davis who scored 11 points on a 4-of-7 clip from the field. For the Wildcats Ty Berry led the way with 14 points three three-pointers four rebounds and four steals shooting 5-of-13 overall. Brooks Barnhizer and Ryan Langborg each contributed 13 points while Boo Buie scored nine points on 4-of-14 shooting. Northwestern shot just 37.7% from the field as a team. After Matthew Nicholson won the jump ball Langborg knocked in a midrange shot and a corner three on the next possession. Ty Berry connected from three and Northwestern began with a quick 8-0 run. Buie continued the hot start with a three to make it 11-0. Hubbard ended the Bulldogs’ scoring drought with a three but the ‘Cats were up 11-3 at the under-16. They had already scored six points off of Mississippi State’s three turnovers. After forcing another turnover Nick Martinelli made a hook shot to extend the lead to 15-3. Northwestern’s hustle was evident as it had forced five turnovers and outrebounded the taller Bulldogs heading into under-12. Mississippi State made two threes to cut the lead but Barnhizer responded with a mid-range jumper of his own to bring the lead to 19-9. However Nicholson picked up his second foul a few possessions later. With he and Blake Preston with two fouls apiece the ‘Cats had to go further down the bench and brought in Luke Hunger. The momentum shifted when Hunger came in and Mississippi State got to within six. Out of the timeout Hunger scored his first points of the season on a driving layup. But Hubbard responded with a three to make it 21-16. Northwestern answered once again by forced a tenth turnover holding a seven-point edge going into the under-four. Following that stoppage Buie made a runner and brought the lead to 25-16 with three minutes to go in the half. Continuing the back-and-forth pace though Shawn Jones Jr. beat Martinelli to the basket for an and-one and the score was 25-22. The teams exchanged baskets in the closing seconds of the half and after a Hubbard three Northwestern led by a slim lead of 29-27. After scoring three points in the first nine minutes of the half the Bulldogs closed with 24 points in the final 11 minutes. Hubbard caught fire and scored 16 points in the first half. Mississippi State came into the game shooting 31.8% from three but shot 45.5% in the first half from distance. However Northwestern’s defensive pressure was solid and it forced 11 turnovers. Barnhizer and Buie in foul trouble had to spend the final two minutes of the first half on the bench and Mississippi State took advantage.  Coming out of the break Langborg knocked down a midrange jumper. Buie made a high-arcing floater to make it 33-27. After Cameron Matthews made a lay-up Buie converted another floater. Not to be outdone Davis drained a three and Hubbard scored two more; the lead was down to 35-34 with 15:55 to go. Berry nailed a three out of the timeout but Davis responded with one of his own. Davis then connected with a midrange at the shot clock buzzer to give Mississippi State its first lead of the game. Langborg responded with a two and Berry put home a three to give Northwestern a 43-39 lead. At the under-12 the ‘Cats were in front by two. Out of the timeout both teams missed contested threes. They both struggled to score until Shakeel Moore made a great fake leading to a dunk that gave Mississippi State a 44-43 lead. D.J. Jeffries added to the output with a midrange jumper though Barnhizer kept the Wildcats within one after a goaltended layup with 7:48 left in the game. Barnhizer nailed a three and the ‘Cats took a 48-47 lead. From there though the Bulldogs seized momentum. They went on a quick 9-0 highlighted by a Hubbard three that gave his team its largest lead of the afternoon. Moore made another layup and Northwestern took a timeout down by eight. Hubbard made another floater and the ‘Cats trailed 58-49 with 3:48 to go. After a lay-up from Barnhizer the freshman knocked down a midrange and two more free throws. Barnhizer continued his assertiveness with another two but it was looking bleak with the Wildcats down 64-53 with two minutes to go.  From there Mississippi State closed out the game without much trouble handing the Wildcats their first loss of the season.

Share this story In the days in advance of showdowns with ranked teams with playoff ramifications on the line or even in primetime journalists often ask athletes whether or not they’re approaching the game any differently. Frequently the answer is no — that the team can’t worry about outside hype and instead needs to remain true to its fundamentals. From a press perspective one could argue that covering a game should be the same way with atmosphere or external circumstances not dictating emotions. But I’d be lying if I said that was the case prior to Northwestern’s Week 12 tilt with Purdue. With the sun beaming down on a high-cut grass field around 9:45 a.m. Saturday it was hard not to soak everything in before the Wildcats’ last home game of the season. Even while walking through dark stadium tunnels to get onto the field or noticing pylons outfitted with purple “N”s I earnestly told myself don’t take this for granted. So much for the thought of stoicism: Saturday’s matinee did have higher energy because it was set to be Northwestern’s final game at Ryan Field (barring the Evanston City Council’s Monday vote). That buzz was palpable among fans tailgating and fellow media members too. That is until we reached the second drive of the game for both teams. Although Northwestern went 53 yards in four plays to jumpstart a 6-0 lead neither team found the board again until the 7:38 mark of the third quarter when Jack Olsen converted a 30-yard field goal. In effect the sides went almost two full hours of real time without scoring whatsoever. It was evident early on that a bonafide Big Ten West brawl had ensued and that’s exactly what transpired. On the afternoon NU and PU combined to go 11-for-30 on third down miss two field goals under 45 yards and score only two touchdowns despite having six total red zone possessions. There wasn’t much to write home about if you enjoyed clean execution or protection of the pigskin. Yet therein lies the innate unbridled beauty of not just Northwestern’s division but also of Wildcat football. Both in 2023 and in past decades wins have come dotted with warts; little has gone perfectly to script. Saturday was another one to add to the ledger of ugly victories with Purdue rushing for over 300 yards more than doubling Northwestern’s number of “big” plays (10+-yard runs/15+-yard completions) and having a 15% higher offensive success rate. Despite allowing the Boilermakers to consistently get deep in their territory the Wildcats’ defense came up clutch time and time again — including surrendering no points on three plays from inside the 2-yard line and on Xander Mueller’s game-winning interception from the NU 35. When reading those metrics and watching the tape you could be amazed at Purdue’s offensive ineptitude inside opponent territory despite moving downfield easily struck by the ‘Cats’ key stops or a combination of both (this is where I fall). For as frustrating as such a game may have been it reflects the very tenets of Northwestern football since it started playing at Ryan Field in 1926: victory no matter how is the only priority. Even the attendance element of Saturday was a microcosm of nearly 550 games on Central Street. As usual students donning purple white and black filled in along the southwest section all the way throughout the first quarter. Sure it may have looked sparse to start but that area eventually appeared mostly full to cheer on NU. The icing atop a bittersweet farewell cake (which some literally brought) was students storming the field after securing the win against the Boilermakers the program’s golden ticket to play in a bowl game after going 4-20 the last two years. Would many other supporters of Power Five programs have rushed onto midfield to surround their head coach after beating a 3-7 rival? Maybe not — but that’s precisely what makes Northwestern as an institution and athletics phenomenon so distinct. When delving deeply into the Wildcats’ season you could argue that none of their wins have been perfect; even a 38-7 beatdown over UTEP was tied at the break and a homecoming game with Howard was a struggle to close out. There’s considerable room for improvement in all three phases as the program looks to 2024 and beyond with David Braun as its full-time head coach. That being said to look from a macro lens and consider that Northwestern sits at 6-5 with a 4-4 Big Ten record and will play in a bowl game is purely pretty magical. That’s true based on not only the personnel losses NU suffered and the miserable struggles from 2021-22 but more so considering a program shrouded in deep-seated hazing and culture controversy just four months ago. If Northwestern were currently 2-9 few would have batted an eye. Instead Braun has completely resuscitated a program that truthfully looked on the brink of flatlining. Following the evacuation of the field and conclusion of postgame pressers media members had a chance to bask in Ryan Field’s glory one final time. In an especially touching moment a father and his two young sons even dug up pieces of purple end zone grass to preserve and as the dad said pass down to their children. Seriously try not to get choked up. My close friend/fellow Inside NU EIC David Gold and I walked all 100 yards deliberately and introspectively recognizing the honor we’ve had to call this unique place home and the indelible memories forged here. Even then we couldn’t help but remark at how badly an upgrade was needed noticing rusting bleachers purple foam backings lining uncomfortable seats and a single video board under 1200 square feet. For all of its flaws Ryan Field will always possess an innate charm and quaintness a sort of reprieve from an exponentially growing sport with billion-dollar allotments. In lots of ways that’s the exact essence that Northwestern football has carried with it for these 97 years — and which will remain foundational no matter where the ‘Cats call home. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Hearts raced and fingers crossed as senior goalie Annabel Skubisz squared off with North Carolina’s Ryleigh Heck in sudden death overtime. In the national championship the last situation Northwestern wanted to find itself in was defending a penalty stroke. As Skubisz lifted her stick to block the shot and send the game into double overtime Northwestern was reminded of how far it has come as a program. The Wildcats heartbreakingly fell 2-1 in shootouts but that image of Skubisz who led Northwestern to three championship appearances and its first-ever title as a sophomore should be remembered. Her save gave the ‘Cats hope to keep on fighting when the odds were stacked against them.  “We never give up” head coach Tracey Fuchs said. “That’s why we’re the Cardiac ‘Cats.” The Tar Heels simply outplayed the Wildcats in the first half. It took less than 45 seconds for Northwestern to book a penalty corner and let a shot go but that would be its only through two quarters. Even when Northwestern got its second corner opportunity with .7 seconds left in the latter frame a shot was never fired. Meanwhile North Carolina had six shots and rarely ever allowed Northwestern to take the ball into the circle.  North Carolina continued its dominance out of the half. In less than three minutes first-year star Charly Bruder scored off a penalty corner for the lead. But once the ‘Cats came across a penalty stroke with 90 seconds left they returned to usual form given the extra boost that Peyton Halsey’s goal delivered.  As the game went into an extra 20 minutes through two extra quarters each team came narrowly close to walking it off. Towards the end of the second overtime Olivia Bent-Cole and Lauren Wadas had each set each other up on two breakaways but came up short in their respective opportunities.  What truly kept the ‘Cats in the game was Skubisz who proved why she is the country’s best goalie in these pressure-filled situations. She had three saves in just the fifth quarter including off a penalty corner and Heck’s stroke.  Ultimately a game between the two best teams would last for as long as possible. It seemed the shootouts were where NU could claim its victory.  Northwestern made its first two strokes but wasn’t able to hit the boards on the last three. Meanwhile the Tar Heels only made their first and fourth stroke. Fitting the game’s theme five shootouts were not enough to determine a winner calling for another pair. This time around Halsey missed. Heck was then able to make hers and put North Carolina up 3-2 in shootouts to win.  There’s no way to sugarcoat how heartbreaking it is to have come just a shot away from the national title. It certainly doesn’t help to fall to North Carolina which has now become Northwestern’s ultimate foe. The memory of now-head coach Erin Matson scoring the championship-winning goal last season against the ‘Cats is still too clear but it will fade. “You know it hurts today but I think when we look back we’ll be really really proud” Fuchs said.  And Northwestern should be proud. It should be proud for forcing two overtimes and shootouts even though it lacked possession for the majority of the play. It should be proud of a season that had just one loss before the national championship game. ""The ‘Cats should be proud that after only making the NCAA Tournament twice from 1995 to 2018 it just appeared in its fifth straight postseason and third straight championship. Just as Skubisz’s penalty stroke save gave the 2023 Wildcats hope to win the programs overall success should give it hope that it’ll be raising the trophy soon again. "" As Northwestern and North Carolina played for the crown these past two seasons there was never a question that the two best teams made it to the final game. But the Tar Heels have always been a dynasty. They did just lock down their 11th title and fifth in six seasons. However the Wildcats are now on the same level. That growth speaks volumes to Fuchs and every one of her players over the past five years. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story For the first time this season Northwestern men’s basketball headed out on the road. For what seems like the millionth time already in just two weeks of action it came out of games with mixed results. A Saturday win over Rhode Island and a nine-point defeat to Mississippi State the following afternoon certainly had their highs and lows. Here are a few: Northwestern is capable of starting lightning-fast 22-2 and 17-6. Those were the leads Northwestern held at the 9:45 mark of the first half in each of their clashes this weekend. NU’s defense on Rhode Island was so stifling in the early going that it held the Rams to an almost unfathomable 1-of-18 start from the field. Against Mississippi State the ‘Cats forced seven turnovers in the first 10 minutes. In both contests most of Northwestern’s scoring didn’t just come from one hot hand. It came from a balanced combination of Ryan Langborg Ty Berry and Boo Buie.  After alarmingly-slow starts against Binghamton and Western Michigan this was a welcome sight. Against both a superior opponent and an underdog in a neutral setting NU proved it could set the tone and dictate the pace of the game from the beginning. Doing that against the Bulldogs which now sit at No. 17 nationally in KenPom’s adjusted efficiency margin is especially encouraging. It propelled the ‘Cats to their first win of the weekend and put them in great position to go toe-to-toe with an Mississippi State squad that should be their most challenging test of the non-conference slate. That won’t matter if the perimeter defense struggles like it did Fair warning: a long one. Chris Collins has said repeatedly that winning the turnover battle and staying below 10 giveaways is a program staple. Northwestern had a +9 turnover margin this weekend and hovered around that 10-giveaway threshold (11 against URI nine against MSU) but its defense couldn’t capitalize on those dominant starts mentioned above. Why? It was largely due to issues in an area that served as a primary source of success last season: defending the perimeter. These problems have persisted throughout the first five games of the 2023-24 campaign as Northwestern has allowed its opponents to shoot 38.4% from three-point land. Rhode Island’s guards particularly Zek Montgomery and Cam Estevez were the catalysts behind a few runs that brought their team to within four points of NU before the first half even ended. The Rams shot 42% from three-point land on the day and frequently got to the free throw line by attacking the rim. Their top four guards/wings — Montgomery Estevez Jaden House and Luis Kortright — earned 19 of URI’s 22 attempts from the charity stripe. For NU if you subtract Brooks Barnhizer’s eight attempts six of which came on intentional fouls or offensive rebounds the guards earned just four. A bunch of those Rhode Island buckets came on defensive breakdowns which is something that Northwestern prides itself on avoiding. It got worse the following day. Mississippi State freshman Josh Hubbard erupted against the ‘Cats pouring in 29 points and four threes. It was apparent that Northwestern which hadn’t had fewer than three days of rest between games before enduring this back-to-back faded defensively late in the second half. The aggressiveness that has come to define NU on that end of the floor was sporadic and it led to a number of easy looks. This sequence was rough: As usual Nicholson hard-hedges but Berry recovers after the catch and drive from D.J. Jeffries. Northwestern gets its trademark post trap with Langborg and Berry. But if you pause at that eight-second mark in the clip you can see that Buie and Barnhizer don’t have active hands.  They’re in position to cut off the only two feasible passes Jeffries can make and should be inclined to deny those lanes given the amount of clutter in the post already. However neither player responds until Jeffries turns outward. At that point Barnhizer had already lost Dashawn Davis who drained the three-pointer.  And eventually because Hubbard and Co. got so hot from deep NU doubled down on its over-aggressiveness. That as well as fatigue may have contributed to sequences like the one that gave the Bulldogs the lead for good: Jimmy Bell Jr. slips the first screen and then staggers Barnhizer. In the process Nicholson comes up and goes past the three-point line for a split second. So did Berry though because Northwestern needed to smother a scalding-hot Hubbard. Compare that to the first pick for Davis in the last clip when Barnhizer fluidly went underneath while Nicholson blitzed. In this case that extra step on the hard hedge along with Berry’s pressure gave Bell an extra step on Northwestern’s big man even though he recovered well. On Bell’s ensuing down screen Barnhizer strives to deny Cameron Matthews the ball by going over the top. But due to Nicholson’s positioning he can’t afford to surrender the baseline. Barnhizer hesitates and overcommits Bell bullies Nicholson out of the lane with a terrific seal and Matthews has an easy layup. Hubbard was on fire but Matthews still has not made a single three this season. Admittedly I don’t know enough about Northwestern’s defensive intricacies to determine whether Nicholson and Barnhizer correctly filled their schematic roles here and something else went wrong but this looks like an instance in which the fear of an open jumper lingered in the back of everyone’s minds. Yet in the second half of a grueling back-to-back against a team that should move into the AP Top 25 over-aggressiveness is rarely the best answer to that problem. Whether I’m right or wrong here giving up 39 second-half points isn’t ideal. Northwestern has played at a slower offensive tempo than all but eight teams in the nation thus far and can’t win like that. A four-headed dragon has its benefits... and consequences It’s become pretty clear that Buie Barnhizer Langborg and Berry are each integral parts of Northwestern’s offense. The first two tend to create their own shot while the latter pair has gotten a high volume of catch-and-shoot looks. Whether that holds true come January remains to be seen but Northwestern primarily operated through that quartet this weekend. It combined for 97 of NU’s 123 field goal attempts in the tournament and launched 51 of 61 shots against Mississippi State. The balanced attack paid off handsomely against Rhode Island. Barnhizer and Berry earned most of the first-half looks. As a bonus Blake Preston added six points and six offensive rebounds (yes you read that correctly) in the opening period. That opened up the floor for Buie in the second half who constantly kept Northwestern’s lead at double-digits with response after response. All four players combined for 56 points on the day. Against the Bulldogs it was tougher sledding. Northwestern depended on its perimeter offense against KenPom’s No. 3 defense in the country and multiple players went cold. Buie went just 4-of-14 from the field while Langborg made only one of seven three-point attempts. For the four perimeter players to thrive off each other consistently attacking the paint and attracting significant defensive attention are musts to generate open looks. Buie can do that and Barnhizer’s post arsenal may solve that problem but the quartet can’t overly rely on the three-ball.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The win marked the program’s 1000th all-time victory and despite a much closer win than expected celebration ensued. Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh was absent from the festivities as he was serving the second of his three-game suspension for the ongoing sign stealing scandal but the rest of the team gathered with signs and posed for a team photo to recognize the achievement. The defense and special teams made it all possible this weekend for Michigan. Two safeties both a direct result of the punting units and two interceptions both courtesy of cornerback Mike Sainristil allowed the Wolverines to escape College Park with the win. The result came despite an off-day from J.J. McCarthy and the rest of the Michigan offense.  With the milestone in the rearview mirror all focus for the Wolverines shifts to what lies ahead as a matchup with No. 2 Ohio State awaits in another critical iteration of “The Game.” This year’s edition is for all the marbles as a spot in the Big Ten Championship Game and a likely spot in the CFB Playoff awaits the winner. As for who awaits the winner of the greatest rivalry game in college football when they arrive at the Big Ten Championship Game that would be none other than… Iowa clinches Big Ten West Iowa! The Hawkeyes somehow did it again as their 15-13 home victory over Illinois allowed them to clinch the Big Ten West. Having booked their ticket a trip to Indianapolis for the Big Ten Championship Game is in the Hawkeyes’ future no matter what happens in their regular season finale against rival Nebraska. Iowa has overcome a lot this season to get to this point with injuries to numerous key players and overcame adversity once again in the win over the Fighting Illini. Running back Kaleb Johnson proved to be the hero this time as he scored the go-ahead touchdown on a 30-yard run with just under five minutes to go in the game. The Iowa defense then proceeded to do what it has done all season stopping the Fighting Illini offense on their ensuing possession to preserve victory. As mentioned above Iowa now waits to see who they will play on Dec. 2 where they will do battle against the winner of “The Game.” For now the focus remains solely on this upcoming week’s game against a Nebraska squad that is desperate for a win to keep its season alive. Northwestern Wisconsin clinch bowl berths; Illinois Minnesota Nebraska do not The Cornhuskers are desperate for a win because they blew a 14-point lead to Wisconsin and in doing so failed to capitalize on a chance to reach their first bowl game since 2016. The Badgers went on to win the game 24-17 as the Wisconsin defense picked off Nebraska quarterback Chubba Purdy in overtime to seal the comeback victory. The win clinched a bowl berth in head coach Luke Fickell’s first season in Madison.  Over in Evanston Northwestern head coach David Braun was busy leading his Wildcats to victory over Purdue securing bowl eligibility with a 23-15 win over the Boilermakers. After a controversial and program-altering offseason that resulted in the firing of longtime coach Pat Fitzgerald Braun has led Northwestern from the 1-11 team they were last season to six wins this season and dropped the interim tag off his title in the process.   And while first year Nebraska coach Matt Rhule failed to reach the six-win mark this weekend a couple of more seasoned coaches failed to do the same. Bret Bielema and Illinois with their loss to Iowa and P.J. Fleck and Minnesota with their 37-3 loss to Ohio State also failed to clinch a bowl berth and now go into the final week of the regular season with a bit of pressure. On the bright side all three teams play their final games at home. Nebraska gets Iowa in Lincoln while Illinois gets rival Northwestern in Champaign and Minnesota draws rival Wisconsin in Minneapolis. If all three home teams win they along with Wisconsin and Northwestern would finish the year in a five-way tie for second in the Big Ten West. It would be a fitting way for the most fun division in all of college football to go out.

Share this story The Wildcats welcomed the Purdue Boilermakers to Ryan Field for the final home game of the 2023-24 season. The ‘Cats got it done putting their overall record above .500 for the first time this season. Here are five things we learned from Saturday morning’s contest. The ‘Cats came to play in a jam-packed morning Senior Day. Coach Braun’s first game with the interim tag removed. Last game at Ryan Field. Bowl hopes are on the line. What more could you ask for? There were lots of storylines for this game yet the ‘Cats blocked out the noise and held on for the win. Cam Porter led the way with two rushing scores while Ben Bryant threw for 230 yards and a touchdown. Northwestern will need to continue this theme in the upcoming weeks. With one final game against Illinois before playing in its first bowl game in three years Northwestern must focus. There is no worse time than the end of the college football season for distractions to get the best of a team (looking at you Michigan). The ‘Cats have shown they can dial in and get the job done and they will need to do so going forward in order to bring a bowl game victory back to Evanston. Coming out hot is key In last week’s game against Wisconsin the ‘Cats jumped out to a 24-3 halftime lead before holding on for a 24-10 victory. Two weeks before that domination Northwestern welcomed the Maryland Terrapins into town in which the ‘Cats jumped out to a 24-14 lead in the first half. They also won this game with a final score of 33-27.  Against Purdue the ‘Cats came out flying yet again. The defense forced a three-and-out on the Boilermaker’s first possession followed by Cam Porter scoring a seven-yard touchdown on the first offensive drive. The defense also stood tall for two major stops on fourth down including one on Northwestern’s one-yard line.  Once is an accident twice is a coincidence but three times is a pattern. The ‘Cats have proven that in order to win games they have to jump out to an early lead. Yes there was an early-season come-from-behind victory over Minnesota where Ben Bryant channeled his inner Tom Brady in the second half yet how likely is it to happen again? Defense defense and more defense The defense continues to be the bright spot of this team. In the last six games the Northwestern defense has held the opponent to 20 or fewer points. The one exception was against a Maryland offense that put up 27 points but I think we all know how that game turned out. Nonetheless Bryce Gallagher and Xander Mueller the Big Ten’s second and sixth leading tacklers respectively led the way for a Wildcat win. Gallagher had 14 tackles while Mueller intercepted Ryan Browne’s pass with under a minute to play to seal the victory and secure a bowl for Northwestern. Northwestern’s defense managed to limit the Boilermakers to a measly 140 passing yards while also forcing a punt fumble interception missed field goal and two turnovers on downs all in the first half.  The offense is looking better The Wildcats are beginning to have some life on the offensive side of the ball. Although the group looked to be a promising offense at different points of the season the ‘Cats scored just seven points in a punt-filled game against the Iowa Hawkeyes at Wrigley Field. Yet they bounced back against Wisconsin and followed that performance up with another win against Purdue.  By no means is the offense looking perfect. There is still lots of room for improvement yet it is important to take a look on the positive side. Ben Bryant was connecting with Cam Johnson Bryce Kirtz and A.J. Henning throughout the game and found Johnson for a 52-yard touchdown in the third quarter. Bryant’s 230-yard performance was his second-highest of the season. Meanwhile Cam Porter’s 95-yard game was a season-high which includes his 34-yard rushing touchdown early in the 4th quarter. Northwestern is able to handle clutch moments Despite the ‘Cats leading the entire game Purdue had a chance to send the game to overtime in the closing seconds with a touchdown and two-point conversion. On Northwestern’s 34-yard line with 27 seconds left a Boilermaker come-from-behind victory was definitely not out of the question. Luckily Northwestern’s defense was locked in intercepting the pass and running out the game clock on the ensuing drive. This last defensive stop by the Wildcats is encouraging to see as it proves they can clutch up in big moments and not cave in and blow the lead. Down the final stretch of the season and approaching a bowl game gritty final plays and wins like these are crucial to set the tone and ensure a winning record.    \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Fresh off a 23-15 win to close out Northwestern’s home slate (and tenure at Ryan Field) and secure bowl eligibility David Braun spoke to the media for his weekly Monday press conference ahead of the Wildcats’ rivalry duel with Illinois. Hear everything the head coach had to say about a broad range of topics edited for clarity. Opening Statement: “Really excited about the opportunities ahead of this team. Obviously Saturday was an incredible opportunity for our guys to send the old Ryan field off the right way. The opportunity to become bowl eligible is something that I know all of us within the program are really proud of. That being said it’s very clear from our leadership from our team from myself from our coaching staff that we still have a lot of work to do. A lot of exciting opportunities ahead of us starting with an opportunity to get on the road in a rivalry game that we’ve fallen short in the last couple opportunities. “A team that when we reflect on our performance on Saturday we know that there’s a lot of things that we’ve got to clean up. Didn’t play our best football on Saturday. What an incredible opportunity to come away with a win to know that there’s still a lot of things that we need to improve upon. Have an opportunity to be back to work and evaluate the film this morning and back at practice this afternoon is something that this group is really excited for. So with that said we’re rolling; we’re excited. Know that we’ve got quite a challenge on our hands with a really good Illinois team that’s fighting for their own bowl eligibility and in a big time rivalry game.” On coaching changes: “The specific areas we’re looking at right now are positions that are currently open. Within the transition there were some support staff positions that either weren’t filled or just due to the uncertainty of the entire program at the time some people that took other opportunities; those are things that we’re taking a look at right now to make sure that we can continue to push the program forward. In terms of other decisions we’ve got too much at stake with this group. We’re just really focused on making sure that we’re putting ourselves in a situation to be at our best for Illinois. “Those conversations and that thought process will start after Illinois; but also being very conscious of making sure that we’re doing a great job of staying present and being at our best for whatever bowl opportunity awaits us.” On changes in recruiting pitches now that he’s the permanent head coach: “It changes from a standpoint of you get less questions right? And that’s great. There’s a certain level of certainty in terms of the fact that you make a decision to come to Northwestern. I can look a young man and his family in the eye and say ‘Hey I’m gonna be here for that.’ But in terms of the messaging and what we have to offer here at Northwestern so much of that stays the same. We had a young man [DE Braxton Strong] verbally commit to us this weekend which was really exciting. “A lot of things that I was talking about with recruits even prior to the opportunity to become the permanent head coach I mean a lot of the messaging is still the same. And I think that speaks volumes to what this place stands for; the values within the university in the football program. There’s a lot of young men out there that understand what an incredible opportunity is to play football in the Big Ten and to get a Northwestern degree.” On the Class of 2024: “It’s unique with roster management right now. As everyone in the room knows with still having guys on the roster that have a COVID year it’s unique. But looking at that right now we probably have room for two more commitments in the class as it looks on paper. Just got to continue to bend our knees and stay flexible in terms of how this continues to push forward and some of the decisions that our upperclassmen make in terms of their remaining eligibility. But we’re really excited about where we’re at with this class. Where it ranks on paper we don’t know nor do we care. We’re excited about the character the work ethic the competitive spirit that these guys possess — the growth potential and development potential that they have.” On what he’s learned about the HAT: “It’s been a great learning opportunity for me to ask the staff to ask our Leadership Council this morning what this rivalry means to them. The consistent message is ‘Coach we want the HAT back. It’s time to bring the HAT back.’ Just to see and feel and sense the urgency that’s within this group right now to ensure that we’re at our best today for a Monday practice; to make sure we’re taking the steps necessary to be at our best on Saturday. One of the many things that makes college football so special. Rivalry week is something that this group is certainly amped up for.” On if he’s seen the HAT: “I mean in pictures but not in person. There’s just something about rivalry games especially when you’re playing for a trophy. Time at North Dakota State playing for the Dakota Marker I mean those games are just things that stay with you as a player and as a coach. You can certainly sense within this group especially with upperclassmen — they want to make sure they continue to communicate how important it is to the young guys within this program about how our preparation this week is critical.” On the Dakota Marker: “North Dakota State. South Dakota State. It’s basically a really really heavy rock. You better be prepped up in the weight room to lift that thing over your head. For me it’s been neat these last 24 hours just to ask guys like Tim McGarigle all the guys on the staff that had been here in our current leadership and upperclassmen what it means to them. Continue to educate myself on what it’s all about and what it’s going to require for us to be successful.” On if he’ll lift the HAT over his head if NU wins: “I’ll worry about that if we’re fortunate enough to be victorious. Those are moments you’ve got to celebrate. And like I said you better stay prepped up in the weight room and make sure you’re ready for that moment.” On how he’s grown since the Rutgers game: “I think I’ve always felt comfortable from a standpoint of being with our players; stepping into a leadership role; trying to bring people together and pull the best out of this group. Lead from a position of just serving the group. That’s something that hasn’t changed that stayed consistent. From a day-to-day operations and recruiting and organization and nutrition for our guys — all these things that come into play as a head coach — very fortunate to have an incredible support staff here that does such an incredible job with that. “Where I think I’ve really grown is just understanding where I need to delegate responsibility; not trying to micromanage. Where that’s really embodied is just in our defensive prep on the defensive side of the ball. There’s certain ways that I’ve gone about it over the years as a defensive coordinator. Probably in that Week One I was trying to do it like I had always done it and quickly realized you can’t do that — not with the other responsibilities that are that are that are on my plate right now. “It’s just really a credit to that defensive staff in terms of the way that we’ve kind of caught a rhythm and delegated responsibility. Guys have taken ownership in those responsibilities. The efficiency that we’re clicking at on that side of the ball just in terms of our weekly prep and game-planning is a credit to that staff — that group of men. That’s where I feel like I’ve had my most dramatic growth is just balancing that along with it all with all the responsibilities that come along with the role of head coach.” On the best version of the NU-Illinois rivalry: “At its best you have two programs that are winning a lot of football games; that have great stories to tell not only to their own teams but also on the recruiting trail. I give Coach Bielema and his staff a lot of credit. I think they’ve made a commitment to recruiting the state of Illinois in the Chicagoland area. We’ve experienced it even in this last recruiting cycle. If you want to beat an in-state rival on some of those recruits you better be putting some good things on tape on Saturdays and find a way to win those rivalry games.” On if he’s considered eliminating Illinois from bowl eligibility: “To be honest with you it’s not something that’s on my mind or that I’ll be communicating with the team. We’ve talked about leaving no doubt and being really proud of the way that we finish  this regular season. This is an opportunity to do that. It’s an opportunity for us to finish off the regular season the way that we set out to be really proud of the way that we’re playing at the end of the season. And this team has found ways to consistently improve over the course of the season. We need to do that again this week be at our best. And again there’s incredible motivation for us to to bring that that trophy back to Evanston.” On strategizing for multiple quarterbacks: “In some ways we’re dealing with a similar set of circumstances from a standpoint of Illinois having two very talented quarterbacks [Luke Altmyer and John Paddock] that have played at times at a really really high level. Both bring a really good skillset; a little bit different skillset. But that can create some issues in your preparation when you’re uncertain of will you see one or the other? Will you see both? And you have to be really honest with yourself on what Purdue was successful with and making sure that you’re addressing some of those issues and concerns. Some of those come back to just playing with better fundamentals; better tackling; better leverage. But some of them you’ve got to really tip your hat to Purdue and the things that they were able to attack with with a quarterback that had the ability to carry the football — whether that be in draw scenarios or designed quarterback run game. Understand that Illinois’s a really well-coached team that’s going to see that on film and find ways to check us and test us in those areas.” On surrendering over 300 rushing yards to Purdue: “We did not play at our best. Again a credit to Purdue: they did a great job; they had a really good plan. We have to play better. I will continue to praise our guys. Sometimes in modern college football people get really tied up in the stats of yards. At the end of the day the only stuff that matters to us is the win or the loss. “In modern offense good offenses are going to find ways to move the football. We’ve got to find ways to just limit our exposure to points. If they’re gonna go from fourth down we’ve got to get off the field on fourth down. We’ve got to hold teams to field goals. But for us to think that we don’t need to improve dramatically in some areas moving into this week we’d be kidding ourselves. We got to be honest with ourselves; take 100% responsibility. We’ve got to be better this Saturday on defense.” On the development of Carmine Bastone: “Gosh I’m just really proud of Carm. I’m proud of the way this program operates; the way that everyone within our program values guys that come here as walk-ons and find ways to earn opportunities. For him just to continue to improve — and not only improve but produce. All you have to do is come out to a practice and see the way that that guy works and the energy that he brings. It’s no surprise. A couple years ago would you have said that it would be unlikely that he’d be having this type of impact on our program? I don’t know maybe. But you see that guy go to work every day. It’s no surprise that he’s producing on Saturdays the way that he is.” On his go-to Thanksgiving plate:  “I don’t think I’ve had a food on Thanksgiving that I didn’t like. The hard part is how you fit it all on one plate. I am definitely a sucker for some good mashed potatoes and gravy turkey stuffing. And don’t count out the dessert. I’ve never met a dessert a pumpkin pie or a pecan pie that I didn’t enjoy. So I’ll tell you what: I better get my butt on the treadmill and stay on top of my workouts this week.” On the special teams unit’s effect on the team’s success: “It’s absolutely critical. It’s complementary football it’s all three phases. It’s really fun to see the way that our specialists go to work each and every week. Jack [Olsen]’s done an incredible job really leading that group but Will Halkyard... We had a mishap on that first extra point such a credit to Will of just flushing that. Had a great game throughout the rest of the day. And again something that we talk about with special teams is there’s not a single guy on this roster or any college roster that walks into the facility Day One says it’s my dream to be the starting right guard on punt. That’s my end goal. But the way that you go to work in terms of the individual work that you put into special teams the effort you put into special teams as a freshman sophomore junior senior is the direct reflection about how much you really care about the team. How much you really care about your teammates.  “I think of a guy like Braden Turner that continues to show up on special teams. Evan Smith continues to show up on special teams. It’s your proving ground that builds the confidence. It’s no surprise that Braden Turner had one of his best weeks of practice on defense this week. Did he get on the field defensively? No but he’s producing on special teams. For young men in our program that have dreams and aspirations of playing in the NFL talk to anyone in NFL personnel about one of the most critical pieces to making a 53-man roster and it’s your performance on special teams. So the way that our group continues to embody effort and selflessness on those units is critical to our success.” On Garnett Hollis Jr. and his chase-down tackle on Purdue running back Tyrone Tracy Jr.: “We watched that clip about four or five times yesterday as a defensive staff. Garnett was our defensive player of the week on defense this week. Some of it had to do with his interception and other plays that he made. But a big part of it was was was that effort play. It was an incredible play an even better effort. And again when people are asking about who he is as a competitor who he is as a player very talented young man that has continued to improve. But even more importantly I think his consistency has continued to improve as the season has gone along. His practice habits have continued to improve. And to put something like that on tape? It’s not the first time. He makes a play against Iowa where he’s chasing it down from the opposite side. Then there was a play in Howard just flying to the football. That’s what good defense is all about. That’s what good team football is all about. That’s a play that will stick in my mind for a long long time of what it looks like to be a true team player. Really proud of the way that Garnett continues to improve and take strides to be one of the best corners in the country.” On his vertical and whether he’s made a conscious choice to display more visible energy on the sidelines: “Number one in terms of my vertical I promise you my vertical is not gonna get me recruited anymore. Number two I think it was more of an awareness of head coaching responsibilities calling a defense. Really evaluating how I can better manage the game the communication that needs to happen to do that leaning into everyone on the staff. And starting to realize ‘Hey man are you really being you? Are you really bringing your best to the table on the sideline?’ And I think post-Duke it was an opportunity for me to self-reflect and it made me realize ‘Get out of your own way stop overthinking this and just show up as the best version of yourself each and every Saturday.’ It hasn’t been a conscious effort I think it’s been more of a just a self-reflection of I just need to show up at my best every day for our team. I don’t know what that looks like but I’m gonna give our guys a lot of credit. I’ve told them they gotta hold me accountable just like I gotta hold them accountable. And at least once a game there’s somebody coming up to me and checking me too which has been been really good. I think that’s just an embodiment of me being at my best.” On whether particular doubts have motivated him to prove people wrong: “Honestly that was never a motivating factor. And for those that looked at me that way from the outside looking in I don’t blame people for having that reaction. I think to [special assistant to the head coach] Skip Holtz and [defensive assistant coach] D.J. Vokolek. Those guys entrusted this program and said ‘You know what? We’re gonna come and help.’ And from the outside looking in it looked like there was little hope for this team to have — I don’t know what you want to call it — a successful season a winning season.  “But I think what’s been really neat and something that I’m really proud of is those that were here with this group navigating everything that this group was having to make decisions on in the course of July especially when the portal was open is there was a confidence and a belief that this group could do something really special. But you couldn’t know that unless you were here. And I think the thing that’s been really neat is members of the media have had an opportunity to put on full display what this team has done. And we talked about writing a story the conversations that we’re having about what this group has accomplished just makes me really proud. And again I don’t blame anyone for having doubt in what this team could do. What I’m really proud of is the fact that regardless of any of that our guys knew what was in this team and what was in this facility and what we were capable of and they’ve worked their tails off to put themselves in the situation they’re in right now.” On invites for postseason prospect events particularly the Senior Bowl and whether he talked with Senior Bowl executive director Jim Nagy: “[Director of Recruiting Operations] Sam Mulford has done a really good job with our pro scouts that have come through for the facility. We’ve started to have conversations with our guys here on the team of just giving them feedback on the feedback that we’re getting from those scouts. Specifically with Jim and some of those other bowls there hasn’t been any direct conversation. But the thing that I’m really confident in is there is a group of seniors in this group that — at the beginning of the season may have not caught a ton of traction on that — that those conversations just continue to trend in the right direction. There’ll be some guys that have to make a decision on whether they want to come back for another year of eligibility. It’s just our job as a staff to get them all the information and to make sure that they’re making decisions that are in the best interest of themselves and their families moving forward. But there’s no doubt that there’s a lot of guys on this team that have really put some good things on tape that will serve them well in their opportunities moving forward.” On if Braun’s defensive rotations give recruits an incentive to come to Northwestern by distinguishing it from other programs: “I think so. If we’re gonna talk about being a developmental program then our actions better align with that. The way that we rotate with the D-line group it’s all about development. In some ways it’s forced development. The way that we invest in special teams: an opportunity to develop and build confidence. It takes trust and a willingness to say ‘You know what? This young man might be a walk-on but we trust him to go execute and play at a high level and help us win Big Ten football games. But the thing we’ll continue to lean into here is opportunities are earned here. And if you possess high character toughness work ethic There’s gonna be an opportunity for you here. And Carmine Bastone and P..J. Spencer are incredible. I mean Ray Niro. The list goes on and on of guys that have done that within this program and really carved out special opportunities for themselves.” On his trust in LBs coach Tim McGarigle to help gameplan: “All you’ve got to do is sit in on one of our defensive staff meetings. I’m leaning on Tim a ton I’m leaning on Matt McPherson Christian Smith LaMarcus Hicks D.J. Vokolek. And then [grad assistants] Logan McCormick Duke DaRe. [Quality control analyst] Chris Batti. The guys that are support staff. We have an incredible room. And it’s a collaborative environment. Lot of really smart football coaches great teachers great mentors. Tim’s experience playing the linebacker position having coached it for such a long time. There’s a bunch of guys in that room that view their role not just as a position coach but also view it through a lens of the play-caller what an incredible asset. I’ve always felt that my success as a defensive coordinator has been a direct reflection of having the right room of coaches. And then it’s my job to create a collaborative environment. And then at the end of the day be the decision-maker and have reasons why I make those decisions. But to answer your question directly Tim’s been a critical piece to this defense to this team’s success as well as the rest of that defensive staff. It’s a great group.” On whether he expects to hire a defensive play-caller in the offseason: “I will not be calling defensive plays next year. For Illinois in the bowl opportunity I’ll continue to to keep that consistency. But for me to best serve the program as head coach it’s not in the program’s best interest. That that would be selfish on my part. I have to entrust people that we hired to go do their job not micromanage them. We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it not concerned about that decision right now. But for me to be the best head coach I can be that can’t involve calling plays.” On whether he’s open to a hiring a coordinator with a new scheme: “The non-negotiables [are] going to be making sure that the scheme fits our personnel fits our players and there’s got to be a certain level of consistency. I think our guys have felt —  and no different than when I stepped in — there’s certain things that we’re doing defensively that still carry over for from what [longtime defensive coordinator Mike Hankwitz] was doing. There’s things even last year that this defense was doing that we liked situationally that we kept because our guys are comfortable with it and it makes sense and it’s sound. Guys get themselves into trouble when it’s ‘Oh this is my defense.’ No no no. This is our defense and what puts our student-athletes in the best position to be successful on Saturdays that’ll be the non-negotiable for me moving forward is that whoever’s making those decisions is looking through it from that lens.” \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story As Northwestern football took down Purdue for bowl eligibility the Wildcats’ swimming and diving team traveled to West Lafayette this past weekend to compete at the 2023 Purdue Invitational. This competition served as the team’s mid-season invite which is typically the first time during the college swimming season that athletes go all-out and put up season-best times. The men placed first overall with 1082 points — 155 points ahead of Purdue a team that notably finished in front of Northwestern at the 2023 Big Ten Championships. Meanwhile the women finished in second place with 784 points — 353 points behind Purdue. In total Northwestern won 23 out of the 42 contested events. Here are some of the main highlights from Nortwestern’s midseason performance. Out of all the Northwestern swimmers who competed this past weekend graduate student Ayla Spitz was the only one who posted times that would contend with the best swimmers in the nation. The transfer from California won the 500 freestyle (4:40.25) 200 freestyle (1:44.81) and 200 backstroke (1:53.48) with all three performances outdoing her midseason performances from the last four years in the same events. Spitz didn’t achieve any personal best times in these three swims but they were still formidable. Her 500 free time would have been fast enough to finish 11th at the 2023 NCAA Championships while her 200 free and back times are both near NCAA-scoring territory (at NCAAs the top 16 finishers score points). She also contributed to Northwestern’s 400/800 free and 200/400 medley relays. While leading off the 400 medley relay she set a personal record (52.56) by over a second in the 100 back. Currently Spitz is ranked 19th in the NCAA for the 500 free 24th in the 200 back and 13th in the 200 back.  Considering that she was the only female swimmer to post a time remotely close to NCAA qualification at this meet it’s evident that Spitz is going to be the face of the depleted Northwestern women’s team this season. But she’s looked better than she has in her entire career at midseasons so she’s clearly capable of doing the heavy lifting. On Friday night first-year Diego Nosack won the 400 individual medley by over seven seconds posting a personal best time of 3:44.52. He shaved 0.25 off his previous best and took down Mike Alexandrov’s program record time of 3:45.57 set back in 2005. Coming into college Nosack’s personal best was already faster than Alexandrov’s former record so the fact that he broke it in college isn’t all that surprising. In addition Alexandrov wasn’t exactly known for being an IMer in college specializing more in breaststroke events. However this doesn’t make Nosack’s accomplishment any less special. He still managed to beat a mark that no Northwestern swimmer had touched for 18 years and he smashed it by over a second.  Nosack also won the 200 IM (1:45.76) and placed second in the 200 fly (1:44.56) setting a personal best time by 0.05 in the latter event. Graduate student Andrew Martin and first-year David Grechik both had major breakout swims at this meet improving significantly on their personal best times. Martin a transfer from Xavier had a big race in the 1650 free where he jumped from a best time of 15:04.12 to 14:58.19. He’s currently ranked 14th in the NCAA (the highest event ranking out of any Northwestern male swimmer) and is one of the 16 men who have gone under 15 minutes in the 1650 free. He is now just over four seconds away from what it took to qualify for the NCAA Championships in this event. Martin also won the 500 free (4:19.59) and 200 free (1:37.27) in season-best times. Grechik meanwhile shined in backstroke. He posted a 46.73 to finish second in the 100 back and then went 1:41.92 to win the 200 back by over a second. He improved over a second off his best in the former event and nearly nine seconds in the latter but these big drops make sense considering that he’s an international student from Israel and has never competed in the NCAA yards format before this season. In the 200 backstroke Grechik is ranked 25th in the NCAA but first in the Big Ten (that being said three-time 200 back Big Ten champ Brendan Burns didn’t race the event during midseasons). Coming into the season Northwestern had a group of backstrokers in a similar time range but it’s clear that Grechik is the top one. First-years Cade Duncan and Stuart Seymour posted two of the best relay performances from the Wildcats during this meet with Duncan recording a 100 free relay split time of 41.86 on the 400 medley relay and Seymour going a 19.35 50 freestyle on the 200 free relay. Duncan’s 41.86 was the first sub-42 relay split recorded by any Wildcat since Kyle Bubolz’s 41.92 from the 2008 NCAA Championships. He is also now the second-fastest Northwestern 100 freestyle relay performer of all time behind Olympic gold medalist Matt Grevers who has been as fast as 41.41 before back in 2005.  Northwestern men’s sprinting especially in the 100 freestyle has been extremely weak ever since its 2005-2007 “glory era” with Grevers Bubolz Alexandrov and co. passed. However the fact that the Wildcats have a swimmer let alone a freshman who is capable of going sub-42 is a good sign for the future. Seymour’s relay split was extremely unexpected given that his best time in the 50 freestyle off a flat start is 21.17—over two seconds slower than his split time. He wasn’t put on the ‘A’ relay for the 200 free and medley relay but he swam faster than any Wildcat in the 50 freestyle at this invite. Individually Duncan placed sixth in the 50 free (20.04) second in the 100 free (42.80) and third in the 200 free (1:36.69). His 100 free time was a personal best by 0.05 and he also set a best time of 1:36.03 in the preliminary heats of the 200 free. Seymour placed ninth in the 100 back (48.01) sixth in the 200 back (1:46.11) and third in the 100 fly (47.32) with his 100 fly time being the best time. The Wildcats will head to the U.S. Open in Greensboro N.C. from Nov. 29 to Dec. 2 to race in long course meters which differs from the short course yards format that they compete in during NCAA competitions. Their next NCAA meet will come against DIII UChicago on Jan. 13. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Ryan Field is getting a makeover. After tabling the measure for a week the Evanston City Council voted 6-2 on Monday evening to approve the $800 million renovation of Ryan Field. The Council also approved the rezoning of the stadium’s U2 district on a 5-4 vote with Mayor Daniel Biss breaking a 4-4 tie. As a result Ryan Field will be allowed be used for commercial use. Under the new zoning Northwestern will be able to host up to six concerts each year at the facility. “This is a huge win for the city of Evanston” Dave Davis Northwestern’s senior executive director of neighborhood and community relations said following the meeting. “The onus is now on us to ensure that we live up to the commitments we’ve made throughout the entire process and we continue to engage our neighbors. We are super excited because of what it means to the local Evanston economy what it means culturally and what it means for the future partnership between Northwestern and the city of Evanston.” The City Council’s decision came after five previous hearings nearly 40 hours of testimony from proponents and opposition of the stadium. Monday’s decision reversed the recommendation of the Evanston Land Use Commission which voted 7-2 against rezoning in mid-October. “It’s been a long process”  Northwestern’s chief operating officer Luke Figora said following the meeting. “I’m looking forward to the next step in the project.” To sweeten the deal for Evanston Northwestern pledged $150 million to the city over the next 15 years in a Community Benefits Agreement. The agreement saw NU triple its Good Neighbors Fund to $3 million annually at least $500000 each year to Evanston Public Schools and at least $2.5 million in tax revenue for the city every year. The parties also agreed to a Memorandum of Understanding which will govern Northwestern’s use of the stadium. “The community benefits package agreed to is a historic transformation of the relationships that we have with this institution” Biss said following the vote. “It’s completely different than what’s ever happened between this organization and Northwestern for over 150 years. That’s really really important and I think it sets a new foundation for a new spirit of collaboration going forward.” However there is still plenty of opposition to the project. Public comment slanted heavily against the development and even though the City Council has voted to approve the renovations those opponents are planning to continue the fight. “Tonight our city government sided with powerful insiders and the billionaire donor who controls Northwestern Athletics against the families who live in this community” Most Livable City Association President Dave DeCarlo said in a statement. “It’s been an eye-opening experience: We’ve learned that Mayor Biss is just another politician making backroom deals to advance his career instead of representing the people who elected him.  “After carefully weighing the evidence Evanston’s Land Use Commission overwhelmingly rejected commercial rezoning for the stadium. Mayor Biss and four councilmembers completely ignored that evidence and sold our zoning protections to Northwestern. Our fight will continue now as we seek legal recourse.” Northwestern plans to begin demolition on the old Ryan Field within the next few weeks and the new Ryan Field is scheduled to open prior to the 2026 football season. It is unclear where the Wildcats will play football for the next two seasons. Per release more details will be shared regarding timing and the construction process by the university “at a later date.” \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Another ranked opponent another blowout loss for the Wildcats. Northwestern (3-2 0-0 B1G) was demolished by No. 13 Florida State (5-0 0-0 ACC) 90-52 in the first round of the Ball Dawgs Classic in Las Vegas Nevada. NU never had a chance in the game trailing for all 40 minutes. Further the Wildcats played the contest without head coach Joe McKeown who was tending to a family medical matter. It was a poor shooting day for the Wildcats shooting a mere 30% from the field and 20% from beyond the arc. Hailey Weaver posted her first career double-double with 12 points and 13 rebounds but no other ‘Cat had more than eight. Meanwhile FSU was fueled by 17 from Sara Bejedi and 15 from Alexis Tucker and two other players had 11+ points. The Seminoles won the tip and Tucker nailed a three-pointer six seconds into the game to open the scoring for FSU. Melannie Daley answered with a jumper of her own to get NU on the board but the ‘Cats went ice cold. Northwestern would not score for nearly five minutes and Florida State capitalized going on a 9-0 run to make it 12-2 midway through the first quarter. With 4:29 left in the first frame Caroline Lau sank a pair of free throws to break Northwestern’s scoring drought; however it took NU almost seven minutes to make its second field goal of the game when Paige Mott finished a second-chance layup. Yet the Seminoles continued to pour it on in the first quarter shooting 45.5% from three compared to NU’s 15.8% from the field. By the time the horn blew to end the frame FSU led 23-8. In the first minutes of the second quarter Florida State opened up a 7-0 run before Mott got the Wildcats on the board. Both sides went scoreless for over two minutes until Bejedi found the bottom of the net on a jumper to push FSU’s lead to 18 at the media timeout. Out of the break Northwestern enjoyed a 7-0 run of its own thanks to back-to-back jumpers by Jasmine McWilliams and a triple from Alana Goodchild which cut NU’s deficit to 11. Another Mott lay-in brought the game to within single digits but the Seminoles responded with three to expand their lead back to 12. The teams traded buckets to close out the half and Northwestern headed to the locker room trailing 41-27. Florida State came out scalding in the second half going on an 8-0 run less than 90 seconds into the third quarter forcing NU to call a timeout. Northwestern finally got on the board on a Daley jumper but the Wildcats still trailed by 20. After a few scoreless minutes FSU drilled its 10th three of the game but Weaver responded with a three of her own to bring NU’s deficit back into the teens midway through the third quarter. Casey Harter made a few layups to chip away at FSU’s lead but the Seminoles kept bringing the lead back to 20. The Noles led 63-44 at the end of three. In the final frame the Seminoles went on a 9-0 run to expand their lead to 72-46. On the other side the ‘Cats went scoreless for over four minutes of game action through the final media timeout. The Wildcats finally found the basket in the fourth with 4:47 left in the game when Goodchild hit her second three of the contest. However the game was decided long before as the Noles cruised to a 90-52 victory. Northwestern is back in action from the Dollar Loan Center Friday to take on either No. 4 Stanford or Belmont.

Share this story After a brief hiatus we’re back with Northwestern in the NFL. See how former Wildcats have done in the pros with the playoff chase rapidly approaching. Rashawn Slater: Los Angeles Chargers OT Slater was busy in Week 10 as the Chargers lost in a 41-38 shootout at home against the Lions. As usual he played every offensive snap and didn’t surrender a single pressure or sack. In fact the entire offensive line kept Justin Herbert upright for the entire game but the Chargers couldn’t keep up with Detroit in the end. In Week 11 Slater looked a bit shakier in a loss to the Packers at Lambeau Field. The Chargers played a sloppy game that could’ve gone their way had it not been for some fourth-quarter mishaps. With that being said Slater is still one of the best left tackles in the NFL and could be named to his second Pro Bowl this winter. Week 12 matchup: vs. Baltimore Ravens (Sunday 7:20 p.m. CT) Greg Newsome II: Cleveland Browns CB In a 33-31 win against the Ravens in Week 10 Newsome II had the play of the game. Down seven in the fourth quarter the Browns needed a defensive stop. Lamar Jackson dropped back for Baltimore on second-and-8 and fired but Ogbo Okoronkwo got a hand up and deflected the pass. Recognizing the ball wobbling in the air Newsome snatched it and took it to the end zone for a pick-six — his first NFL interception. While he didn’t have as flashy a game in Week 11 against the Steelers Newsome still recorded three combined tackles including a tackle for loss. He and the Browns held Pittsburgh to just 10 points in a win without quarterback Deshaun Watson. Newsome will look to continue his excellent season from the slot in Denver. Week 12 matchup: at Denver Broncos (Sunday 3:05 p.m. CT) Peter Skoronski: Tennessee Titans OG Skoronski has continued to put up a solid season at left guard for the Titans. He’s still allowed just one sack this season and has proven himself as a building block for the future. The rookie got called for his first career penalty in Tennessee’s Week 11 loss to the Jaguars — he crept too far downfield on an ineligible man call in the fourth quarter setting his offense back five yards in a game that was already settled. Yet the Titans’ O-line as a whole doesn’t look quite as strong. Andre Dillard hasn’t played well at left tackle which raises questions of who will start at the position next year. It’s possible that Skoronski who played tackle at Northwestern could slide outside and dispel draft analysts’ concerns that he lacks the wingspan to protect his quarterback’s blindside. Week 12 matchup: vs. Carolina Panthers (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Ben Skowronek: Los Angeles Rams WR Skowronek remains buried on the Rams’ depth chart making his primary contributions on special teams. In a 20-3 blowout loss against the Packers in Week 10 he attempted one rush in the first quarter that went for negative two yards. The third-year receiver didn’t record any offensive statistics in Los Angeles’ 17-16 win against the Seahawks. His only noteworthy play was an offensive holding call in the third quarter that pushed the Rams back to their 9-yard line. Cooper Kupp did leave the game early with an ankle injury so Skowronek could see more snaps in a divisional clash in Arizona. Week 12 matchup: at Arizona Cardinals (Sunday 3:05 p.m. CT) Anthony Walker Jr.: Cleveland Browns LB Walker Jr. had a relatively quiet night in Cleveland’s 33-31 win at Baltimore in Week 10. He recorded two tackles (one solo) and saw the field for 74% of the Browns’ defensive snaps. In Week 11 against the Steelers though Walker exited in the second quarter with a hamstring injury and didn’t return. The seven-year veteran will look to recover before a mile-high clash against the Broncos. Walker’s been an important piece of Cleveland’s formidable defense so the team will hope that his injury is only a minor tweak. Week 12 matchup: at Denver Broncos (Sunday 3:05 p.m. CT) Adetomiwa Adebawore: Indianapolis Colts DE After recording his first career sack in Week Nine Adebawore didn’t play as much in a grind-it-out win against the Patriots in Germany. He saw the field for just 17 defensive snaps but managed to record a solo tackle and a QB hit. Though Adebawore is still just a rotational pass rusher there’s no doubt that his stock is ascending. The fourth-round rookie recorded five sacks nine tackles for loss and two forced fumbles in his senior season at Northwestern. Adebawore will look to get after Baker Mayfield and the Buccaneers at home on Sunday afternoon. Week 12 matchup: vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Dean Lowry: Minnesota Vikings DE Lowry was inactive with a groin injury in the Vikings’ 27-19 win against the Rams in Week 10. He did appear in Minnesota’s 21-20 loss to the Broncos but he tore his pec and exited the game. Unfortunately he was placed on injured reserve ending his first season with the Vikings. Lowry finished the year with 14 combined tackles a fumble recovery and a pass deflection.  Week 12 matchup: vs. Chicago Bears (Monday 7:15 p.m. CT) Joseph Jones: Tennessee Titans LB Jones returned to action for the Titans in Week 11 after missing the previous two games with a hamstring injury. He played 18 special teams snaps (72%) but didn’t record any stats. The seventh-year linebacker was reverted to Tennessee’s practice squad on Monday so he might not suit up for the Titans’ matchup against the Panthers. Week 12 matchup: vs. Carolina Panthers (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Blake Hance: Jacksonville Jaguars OL Hance came in for just one play in the Jaguars’ embarrassing 34-3 loss to the 49ers in Week 10 — a field goal attempt in the second quarter. In Week 11 against the Titans he played nine offensive snaps and six special teams snaps. The four-year veteran continues to play a situational role for Jacksonville subbing in for injured linemen and entering the game in jumbo packages. He and the Jaguars will look to get the run going in Houston.  Week 12 matchup: at Houston Texans (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) ‘Cats that didn’t play this week: Cameron Mitchell (Cleveland Browns) Godwin Igwebuike (Pittsburgh Steelers) Earnest Brown IV (Los Angeles Rams) Evan Hull (Indianapolis Colts torn meniscus) Ifeadi Odenigbo (New York Jets injured reserve) Tyler Lancaster (Denver Broncos) Joe Gaziano (Atlanta Falcons) Trevor Siemian (New York Jets)  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story One of the distinguishing factors of college football’s Rivalry Week always the final slate of the regular season is an added intensity chippiness and belief that either side can prevail. After all that’s bound to happen when some decades-old trophies and significant bragging rights are on the line. When Northwestern strapped up its pads to take on Illinois last year for the Land of Lincoln Trophy though those sentiments quickly vanished for the Wildcats. The Fighting Illini jumped out to a 17-0 lead at halftime which only doubled to 34-0. The final 41-3 score reflected just how lopsided the affair was with NU committing six turnovers. In fact the 38-point margin tied the largest in the in-state series since 2000. Last November Illinois didn’t just retain the HAT from the year before: the Illini effectively put it above their heads and out of reach from down below. In 2021 Northwestern faced a similar fate losing 47-14 in Champaign while surrendering 459 total yards. It marked the end of a six-game winning streak over the team in orange and blue. Having been outscored 88-17 across the last two years it would surprise few if Wildcat fans and players had dubious thoughts creep in about their ability to claim the HAT for the first time since 2020. But the team is eager for an opportunity to amend its play against maybe its fiercest competitor. “We didn’t play to the best of our abilities obviously” cornerback Garnett Hollis Jr. said noting injuries for NU in the 2022 game. “I think this year is going to be a way different story.” When the ‘Cats battled the Illini at Ryan Field last November Bret Bielema’s team claimed the HAT primarily because of an elite defense. Illinois had three members of its secondary — Devon Witherspoon Jartavius Martin and Sydney Brown — get selected in the first three rounds of the 2023 NFL Draft. That unit snatched five interceptions and Brown even scored twice. Even though Illinois’ defensive backfield looks markedly different this time around Northwestern receiver Bryce Kirtz expects a similar magnitude of chirping as he’s grown accustomed to over four years of rivalry matchups. “It definitely gets you going because those dudes they do talk a lot out there on the field” Kirtz said. “You kind of remember that from the year before.” Unlike 2021 and 2022 though the Wildcats are now more than a Big Ten bottom-feeder. NU enters Memorial Stadium having won three of its last four games and already securing a bowl berth. Yet the road to six wins was anything but linear. The last time the ‘Cats played in a Memorial Stadium — in Lincoln Nebraska — seemed like a possible death knell. David Braun & Co. fell 17-9 to the Cornhuskers leaving umpteen opportunities on the field and sitting at 3-4. Tension was palpable postgame with Braun calling the locker room “crushed.” Kirtz posited that the team wasn’t “physical enough” and needed to “prepare better.” Over a month later it turns out that that once-deflating outcome may have served as a watershed moment for Northwestern which has put an onus on its habits in Hutcheson Field and Ryan Fieldhouse since late October. “Every time we come into practice and we’re physical and we’re intent with what we’re doing we always have good games — whether it be the physicality or just the focus aspect of it” Kirtz said. “Whenever we emphasize it in practice we always come out the next week and we perform that way. I think we’ve kind of realized that as a team now. Every week now we’re coming and bringing everything we have during practice.” Braun and other players like quarterback Ben Bryant have also touched upon the translation between heightened preparatory work and playing sharper on Saturdays. That has particularly rung true following defeats as a seemingly fired up NU has gone 5-0 subsequent to a loss. Although some coaches could institute more work in full pads Kirtz underscored a higher collective tenacity and effort in practice as a sparkplug. “Finishing to the whistle” Kirtz explained as a paramount change. “It’s easy to just stop in the middle of practice. It’s practice; nobody really wants to be here but we have to. Really just finishing until the whistle and finishing 100%.” In addition to leveraging better drills another factor contributing to Northwestern’s latest 3-1 run is an opportunistic defense. The Wildcats still haven’t looked completely stifling on D as evidenced by surrendering 443 yards to Purdue on Saturday. But in that span NU has collected eight takeaways including four from members of its starting secondary — a bunch that’s allowed one receiver to gain over 78 yards in the last four games. On the season Northwestern ranks sixth in the conference in passing defense EPA/play. “We’ve been playing real confident these last couple weeks” Hollis said. “If they [the Illini] want to try to throw the ball around our back end has been doing its job. They’re going to have a rough day.” The biggest challenge posed to the Wildcats’ corners this week will be Isaiah Williams who paces the Big Ten in receptions and is second to only Marvin Harrison Jr. in yards. The junior has especially hit his stride as of late posting Madden-like numbers with 30 catches for 436 yards and four touchdowns in his last three matchups. Nevertheless Hollis has faith that he and his teammates can limit the formidable force. “He’s quick; he’s a good player. He’s good with the ball in his hands after the catch” Hollis said mentioning that he isn’t planning on shadowing Williams. “We’ve got a deep room in the back end and we all can cover. We’re going to have to limit him as much as we can but I don’t think we’re going to have a problem.” For seniors Kirtz and Hollis Saturday could prove to be their final regular-season games at Northwestern and last appearances in the Land of Lincoln Rivalry. The two said they haven’t decided one way or another about declaring for the 2024 NFL Draft. Most pressing no doubt is beating their downstate foe — a drought that could soon come to an end as so many have for NU in 2023. “We know in the back of our head we’ve got to get our revenge” Kirtz said. “Get the HAT back.” \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Even with the win however the fate of the season still hangs in the balance. Share this story “Every new beginning comes from some other beginning’s end.” That might be a quote from philosopher Seneca and a lyric from the 1998 hit song “Closing Time” but to me it better encapsulates the state of Northwestern football following this weekend than anything else. Simply put Saturday was a day many Northwestern football fans will never forget. In a game combining glory history pride and an ounce of nostalgia the ‘Cats emerged victorious in a messy showdown against Purdue sending off Ryan Field in the most fitting way possible. NU bent but didn’t break on both sides of the ball getting the job done and securing bowl eligibility for the first time since 2020. Even more than the game itself I’ll remember what happened after the clock hit zero. Storming the field was an unforgettable experience quite literally a moment of pure joy and bliss. Seeing hundreds if not thousands pour out of the student section and onto the field one last time was telling a sign that enthusiasm for this team is sky high. It makes me so excited for this team’s future — even with plenty of uncertainty about the roster coaching staff and stadium — and I hope that the enthusiasm will carry on and help in delivering the ‘Cats many more victories. To get this experience and to witness this level of success so early during my time at Northwestern was not something I anticipated. The verdict was seemingly in on this team before it even played a snap with many believing that a repeat of last year’s disastrous 1-11 season was again in the cards. As we now know such was not the case as NU continuously impressed even when the odds were stacked against it. That tenacity has gotten the ‘Cats to the six-win threshold with a seventh victory also possible should they beat Illinois on Saturday. While I give the players the utmost credit for their efforts David Braun has been the key to keeping this team afoot all season. Braun was put in a remarkably challenging position from the start taking over a program he’d never coached only two months before the beginning of the regular season. What he’s accomplished is incredible and he absolutely deserves the full-time coaching job that’s been awarded to him. I believe Braun should also win Big Ten Coach of the Year and I don’t think it should be particularly close. Of course Braun is no Jim Harbaugh Ryan Day or James Franklin. Still relative to expectations Northwestern has far exceeded its own compared to the powerhouse schools all of whom were expected to thrive from the start. That brings me back to the anecdote about “Closing Time” I mentioned above. For the ‘Cats as the era of Ryan Field comes to a close a new era with newfound optimism under Braun is just beginning. It might not set it for a while but things are changing in Evanston and for NU football. This team will hopefully be better off for it.  On Monday the Evanston City Council formally approved the new stadium construction and renovations should hopefully commence in the coming weeks. It is undoubtedly a sea change for Northwestern to be playing away from Ryan Field but I don’t doubt this team’s ability to play wherever it calls home (or homes) for the next two or three years. While saying goodbye to Ryan Field is difficult it is a necessary step for this program which will soon hopefully have a state-of-the-art facility that provides one of the best experiences in all of college football. Yet if you ask me someone who’s only attended five home football games (not including the game at Wrigley Field) Ryan Field got its perfect sendoff. In the same way that the 97-year-old stadium is imperfect with its cracks crevices and overly outdated architecture the games NU has played in it — especially this season — have been similarly imperfect. Though for this team imperfection has been the path toward victory. As the Wildcats head to face their intrastate rivals in Champaign and conclude the regular season that same sense of imperfection carries on. This game will not be easy especially away from home but I am confident that Northwestern can get it done. Some believe Illinois wants it more and will outplay NU as a result but I don’t think Braun’s bunch will cave. I don’t see this Northwestern team as a unit that will give up after clinching bowl eligibility and let Illinois share in such an accomplishment.  If the ‘Cats could blow out Wisconsin at Camp Randall Memorial Stadium on Thanksgiving weekend should be a piece of cake compared to that atmosphere. So if I could offer advice to this team I’d tell them not to be afraid because the season isn’t on the line anymore. Northwestern shouldn’t play with a chip on it shoulder; the team should take risks and use this game as preparation for its upcoming bowl. While they’re at it they might as well get into a higher-caliber game where NU can get higher visibility and showcase its talents against a more formidable opponent. Especially during this time of year with Thanksgiving just around the corner Northwestern football is definitely on the list of things I am thankful for. Yes the ups and downs may have made my freshman fall a stressful one but the end result makes it all the more worthwhile.  Couple my thankfulness with a bowl game next month and there’s lots to look forward to for Braun and this team. This weekend’s game still has meaning and is a winnable affair if Northwestern can make the right plays and pick apart the Fighting Illini. Remember even if they don’t win the ‘Cats are still going bowling but it would be nice compensation nonetheless.  So while Northwestern remains in search of its new abode for next season has a lot of holes to fill and has a tough schedule to look ahead to let’s leave those conversations for another day. Before even thinking about 2024 let’s soak in what remains of this season. There might only be two more games to play but Northwestern’s season of dreams isn’t near competition just yet. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story In April 2023 Northwestern lacrosse goalkeeper Molly Laliberty went on the Lax Goalie Rat podcast and made a statement about the goalie position that stuck out. “There’s no other position on the field where you look at the scoreboard and it says for everyone to see how many mistakes you’ve made” Laliberty said of goalkeeping. That quote was what made me truly realize just how much pressure comes with being a goalie and it gave me a newfound respect for the position. A goalie carries the weight of the entire team. They are the only player on the field with no other of their kind to stand alongside them and must perform on their own when the offense and defense can’t protect the ball. As the final barrier between the attacker and the back of the net a goalie’s heroics and errors can single-handedly determine the outcome of a game. To take this conversation from one national championship-caliber Northwestern goalie to another — there are not many people who can carry the weight of being a goalie as well as senior Annabel Skubisz did for Northwestern field hockey this past fall. NU could have lost the national championship game eight minutes into the first overtime when UNC forward Ryleigh Heck stood just seven yards away from Skubisz to take a penalty stroke with nothing separating them. All it took was one swing of the stick and the game could have been over. At that moment it felt like Skubisz was just one gray jersey facing an army of powder blue. She was the only person who could stop UNC from winning its 11th national championship and she was standing beside an overflow home crowd of Tar Heel fans wishing for her to falter. And yet despite all the odds against her Skubisz prevailed diving right to stop Heck’s shot with her stick and keep Northwestern’s title hopes alive.  ️ SCOOOOOOOOOOOBWE PLAY ON. pic.twitter.com/QCdnxhmENe This penalty stroke save was the perfect example of how Skubisz is the epitome of clutch just one bullet point on a long list of her feats that helped keep Northwestern’s season going for quite literally the maximum amount of time possible. Take the Big Ten Tournament semifinals against Ohio State for example. When Northwestern was struggling offensively in the first half Skubisz made three critical saves to keep the game tied ensuring that the momentum wouldn’t swing in OSU’s favor. Or think about the NCAA Tournament semifinals versus Duke when Skubisz slid onto the ground on a moment’s notice to stop Blue Devil attacker Hannah Miller from tying the game up. Or the quarterfinals against Louisville when she made five saves in a nail-biter match that could have ended much differently if she weren’t the one in goal. Even in the national championship game Skubisz kept on fighting after her critical penalty stroke save. She stopped the ball on three occasions during the penalty shootout keeping Northwestern alive for a second round. Heck ended up getting the best of Skubisz at the start of that round to win the national championship for UNC but make no mistake: the Wildcats wouldn’t have even gotten to that point without Skubisz. Throughout the season Skubisz allowed more than one goal in just three different games and recorded 13 shutouts. Her 87.5% save percentage ranks as the highest in the nation. She was named Big Ten Goalie of the Year and the Big Ten Tournament MVP. Time and time again she made critical saves under pressure when her team needed them the most with her defensive stops often deciding the game or translating into offensive momentum for the Wildcats. Even though Northwestern didn’t get the final result that it wanted everything that Skubisz did for her team should not be diminished. She handled the unique difficulties of her job like a champion and her performances will be a shining highlight of the Wildcats’ season to be remembered for the ages. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After 11  weeks of chaos (especially in the Big Ten West) the picture is finally clear. No. 17 Iowa clinched an appearance in the Big Ten Championship Game for the second time in the last three seasons after defeating Illinois 15-13. Northwestern and Wisconsin both reached the six-win mark and are now officially going bowling although if you told someone back in August that those two teams would have the same record going into the 12th week of the season they would call you crazy. And yet it still feels like the West will have one final week of ridiculousness before the division format goes away despite the winner of the division already being decided. Of course the story of the weekend will be the showdown in Ann Arbor between No. 3 Michigan (which just reached 1000 all-time wins as a program) and No. 2 Ohio State. But before rivalry week kicks off let’s look back at what happened last weekend. 1. Michigan (11-0 8-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 1 Last Result: 31-24 win at Maryland Next Game: vs. No. 2 Ohio State Recently with turmoil off the field raging on the Wolverines have shown some vulnerability. J.J. McCarthy had four straight games of above 70% completion percentage and 200+ passing yards but in the last two weeks without Jim Harbaugh on the sidelines he has taken a step back. McCarthy has combined for just 201 passing yards in the last two games and hasn’t thrown a touchdown since throwing four TDs against Michigan State. Michigan’s defense gave up 24 points to Maryland over the weekend but also forced two safeties and three turnovers (including a scoop-and-score) in Michigan’s round-number victory. While Michigan remains undefeated the Wolverines have a few things to tweak before facing off with Ohio State on Saturday. 2. Ohio State (11-0 8-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 2 Last Result: 37-3 win versus Minnesota Next Game: at No. 3 Michigan The last few weeks have easily been the best Ohio State has looked throughout the season. OSU has surpassed the 35-point mark in each of the last three games and if you only look at their last two matchups with Michigan State and Minnesota the Buckeyes have outscored those opponents by a combined score of 75-6. The Buckeyes’ defense has not allowed more than 17 points in any game this season but the offense had been questioned throughout the year. Pair that with back-to-back games above 430 offensive yards and TreVeyon Henderson looking unstoppable on the ground against Minnesota and Ohio State looks more than ready to challenge the Wolverines in Ann Arbor. 3. Penn State (9-2 6-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 3 Last Result: 29-6 win versus Rutgers Next Game: at Michigan State Despite Drew Allar exiting Saturday’s game with an injury Penn State rolled to a comfortable victory against Rutgers. Once Allar went out the Nittany Lions relied heavily on the run game and Rutgers could not stop them. Backup quarterback Beau Pribula only threw one pass but he rushed for 71 yards and a touchdown on eight carries.  The defense once again showed up for Penn State as it held Rutgers under 100 rushing yards despite the Scarlet Knights running 42 times. PSU will move on to a very winnable matchup with Michigan State with the hope of eclipsing 10 wins for the fifth time in James Franklin’s 10 seasons at the helm. 4. Iowa (9-2 6-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 4 Last Result: 15-13 win versus Illinois Next Game: at Nebraska Despite failing to score 20 points for the fifth time out of eight conference games the Hawkeyes mounted a fourth-quarter comeback (albeit they were only down four points) to beat Illinois. After John Paddock threw for over 500 yards against Indiana Iowa’s defense held him under a 50% completion percentage and prevented him from throwing for a touchdown. Iowa’s victory allowed the Hawkeyes to be crowned the last Big Ten West champion for the foreseeable future. While the winner of Michigan-Ohio State is expected to easily defeat Iowa the Hawkeyes’ defense deserves a lot of credit for propelling an abysmal offensive team to a conference championship game appearance. 5. Maryland (6-5 3-5 B1G) Last Ranking: 6 Last Result: 31-24 loss versus Michigan Next Game: at Rutgers Maryland started the season 5-0. Since that point the Terrapins have lost five out of six games although their schedule has been much harder than it was at the beginning of the year. UMD bounced back from losing four games in a row with a road victory against Nebraska and looked like their early-season selves against Michigan. Despite an abysmal 15 rushing yards on 33 carries (mainly the result of four sacks and six TFLs from Michigan’s defense) Maryland stayed within striking distance against the Wolverines. Taulia Tagovailoa averaged eight yards per attempt en route to 247 passing yards; without a few costly turnovers the Terrapins could have pulled off the upset. If Maryland avoids unforced errors against Rutgers it will take home the victory. 6. Rutgers (6-5 3-5 B1G) Last Ranking: 5 Last Result: 29-6 loss at Penn State Next Game: vs. Maryland Since taking a 9-7 lead into halftime against then No. 1 Ohio State the Scarlet Knights have been in freefall especially on offense for 10 straight quarters. Rutgers has scored just 13 points in those 10 quarters (the second half against Ohio State and losses to Iowa and Penn State). Rutgers fans are holding out hope for a victory against Maryland to give the Scarlet Knights a chance to reach eight wins for the first time since 2014 their first year as a member of the Big Ten. If the offense can get back on track this weekend Rutgers will have a shot to move to 7-5 with a shot at win No. 8 in a bowl game. 7. Northwestern (6-5 4-4 B1G) Last Ranking: 9 Last Result: 23-15 win versus Purdue Next Game: at Illinois After Brendan Sullivan kept the ‘Cats afloat going 2-2 in his four starts Ben Bryant’s return has propelled Northwestern to two straight victories. As a result of the 23-15 home win over Purdue Northwestern is going bowling for the first time since 2020. Bryant threw for 230 yards Cam Porter rushed for 95 yards on 17 carries and the NU defense came up with big play after big play (including a three-play goal-line stand) to secure the victory. The Wildcats take momentum into the battle for The HAT with a chance to finish second in the Big Ten West with a win against Illinois after being picked to finish last in the preseason media poll. If Northwestern defeats the Illini the Wildcats would have a chance (in the bowl game) to reach eight wins for the first time since 2018. 8. Wisconsin (6-5 4-4 B1G) Last Ranking: 11 Last Result: 24-17 win versus Nebraska Next Game: at Minnesota The Badgers had a few rough weeks with both quarterback Tanner Mordecai and running back Braelon Allen missing time due to injuries. While the duo returned against Northwestern Wisconsin still struggled and scored just 10 points against the Wildcats. But the story for the UW against Nebraska was the defense.  After giving up 14 points in the first quarter against the Cornhuskers Luke Fickell’s defense stepped up. Nebraska punted every possession in the second half until its final drive which resulted in the game-tying field goal. Allen scored a three-yard touchdown in overtime while the defense picked off Chubba Purdy to secure the 24-17 victory and clinch the Badgers’ 22nd consecutive appearance in a bowl game. 9. Illinois (5-6 3-5 B1G) Last Ranking: 8 Last Result: 15-13 loss at Iowa Next Game: vs. Northwestern Illinois seemingly found its quarterback after John Paddock threw for over 500 yards in an overtime victory against Indiana. Predictably against a stingy Iowa defense he was not able to repeat the stellar performance. Paddock did throw for 215 yards but it took him 47 passing attempts (22 of which were completions) to get there. The Fighting Illini only averaged 2.8 yards per carry and the lack of a successful rushing attack surely contributed to the offensive struggles on Saturday. All things considered keeping it close against Iowa on the road is not a bad sign. If Illinois can get more balance on offense against Northwestern the Illini will have a chance to clinch their second consecutive appearance in a bowl game on Saturday. 10. Nebraska (5-6 3-5 B1G) Last Ranking: 7 Last Result: 24-17 loss at Wisconsin Next Game: vs. No. 17 Iowa Nebraska suffered a tough loss against Wisconsin. After taking a 14-0 lead in the first quarter Nebraska’s offense stalled. While quarterback Purdy and running back Emmett Johnson reappeared in the clutch to help lead the game-tying field goal drive the Cornhuskers were not able to carry that momentum into overtime. An interception thrown by Purdy sealed Nebraska’s fate and the Cornhuskers will have to wait one more week to see if they will play in a bowl game. Regardless of this weekend’s loss to Wisconsin Nebraska has made tremendous progress in Year One under new head coach Matt Rhule. The Cornhuskers can get to six wins for the first time since 2016 if they can pull off an upset against No. 17 Iowa. 11. Minnesota (5-6 3-5 B1G) Last Ranking: 10 Last Result: 37-3 loss at Ohio State Next Game: vs. Wisconsin Minnesota looked completely overmatched against the Buckeyes on Saturday. While the Golden Gophers were not supposed to win this game or even keep it close this performance was abysmal. After scoring 26 and 30 points against Illinois and Purdue respectively UMN only gained 159 total yards against Ohio State’s stingy defense. The Golden Gophers find themselves in total collapse with three straight losses heading into a rivalry matchup with Wisconsin. Minnesota’s defense has given up 37.7 points per game in its last three games but if the Gophers can tighten up on the defensive end they will be able to compete on Saturday. 12. Michigan State (4-7 2-6 B1G) Last Ranking: 14 Last Result: 24-21 win at Indiana Next Game: vs. No. 11 Penn State Michigan State rallied late to beat Indiana 24-21 after the Hoosiers missed a field goal with just two seconds left on the clock. After a six-game losing streak gave Michigan State a 2-6 record including zero wins in conference the Spartans have actually responded. Although it is too little too late MSU has won two out of its last three games (with the only loss coming against Ohio State on the road). Unfortunately for Spartans fans it is highly unlikely that Michigan State can end the season like it began the year (with two consecutive victories) as No. 11 Penn State comes into town this weekend.  13. Indiana (3-8 1-7 B1G) Last Ranking: 12 Last Result: 24-21 loss versus Michigan State Next Game: at Purdue Brendan Sorsby threw for 192 yards and two touchdowns against Michigan State and also contributed 59 yards to a rushing attack that tallied 210 yards on Saturday. But unfortunately that was not enough to lead the Hoosiers to a victory. Indiana has now suffered heartbreaking losses in back-to-back games. After losing 48-45 in overtime against Illinois the Hoosiers missed the game-tying field goal against Michigan State.  IU has lost six of its last seven games but a matchup with Purdue on Saturday gives the Hoosiers a decent chance to take a little bit of momentum into next season with a win over their in-state rivals. 14. Purdue (3-8 2-6 B1G) Last Ranking: 13 Last Result: 23-15 loss at Northwestern Next Game: vs. Indiana The loss against Northwestern was almost entirely due to missed opportunities. Purdue had no trouble gaining yards and only punted once in the first half. The issue? Despite just one drive stalling out in a punt PU never scored in the first half. After a missed field goal an interception a fumble and two turnovers on downs the Boilermakers found themselves trailing 6-0 at the half despite outgaining Northwestern 186-122. In the second half Purdue eventually went on two touchdown drives but another turnover on downs and interception on the final drive of the game allowed the Wildcats to take home the victory. The good news for Boilermakers fans is that a rivalry week matchup with Indiana should be the easiest conference matchup of the season so there is a possibility to end the season on a relatively high note.      \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story There is a joke inside Northwestern football: if you see Cam Johnson the odds are high that Bryce Kirtz will be right with him. Since Kirtz hosted Johnson on his official visit to Northwestern the duo has been inseparable so much so that they intended to go as Thing One and Thing Two for Halloween. When Thanksgiving rolls around it will be Johnson his mother and Kirtz sitting around the table in Johnson’s apartment. ""The two receivers off-the-field connection has found its way in-between the sideline With one game remaining in the regular season the veterans have combined for 83 catches 1149 yards and eight touchdowns. Their numbers are nearly even providing reliable targets for whoever is under center. "" “I think that it pays dividends on the field” Johnson said Tuesday morning. “Just knowing that we’ve got each other’s back. If somebody makes a play we’re all excited for each other. Maybe we don’t get the catch but we’re all going to block each other because we want to see the other one succeed.” While it has not always been easy for the tandem under the tutelage of receivers coach Armon Binns — a former NFL receiver — has elevated the play of both pass-catchers who are enjoying career seasons. They pointed to his attention to detail and drive for greatness that helped both receivers reach their potential. “He knows what it takes to get to the gets to the NFL and he knows what those guys look like” Kirtz said. “The biggest thing is he teaches us to beat the best. We go out there and do something good but did we do it to win against the best.” Kirtz who is now in his fifth season in purple and white lost most of last season due to injury finishing with a meager 212 yards. He had never ended with more than 20 receptions in a season but heading into the year was expected to be the ‘Cats’ top receiver. Kirtz said that he focused on his releases off the line of scrimmage which Coach Binns has helped “get down to the T” and it has paid off. If you turn on the tape you’ll see No. 17 snatching ankles on post-corners stop-and-gos or even a deep out. In Week Four his 215-yard performance was the most by a NU receiver in a single game since Flynn Nagel had 220 against Nebraska in 2018. However even though Kirtz has spent half a decade in Evanston he noted Johnson has helped him remain even-keeled this season. “Sometimes I catch myself freaking out like ‘What’s the call?’ Thinking I’m in a rush. He’s like ‘Just calm down the call is this’” Kirtz said. “He has taught me to just be poised.” On the other side of the field Johnson’s third stop in college football has undoubtedly been his most successful. After spending four years at Vanderbilt he took a pit stop at Arizona State before finishing his career in Evanston. Despite being 6-foot even No. 14 plays above the rim. Throw the ball up and there is a strong chance that he will come down with it. While his ability to go get the football is impressive what he can do after the catch is what scouts notice. Johnson is hard to bring down in the open field — juking and sometimes even trucking his way for extra yardage. Although Johnson plays a huge role for the ‘Cats on the field he has also become a leader inside the locker room. When Pat Fitzgerald was fired back in July this wasn’t the first time the sixth-year had dealt with a change at that position. Johnson has played for six different head coaches in college but this time it was different. Even with the transfer portal opening for 30 days after Fitzgerald was fired Johnson remained committed to NU and used his previous experience to guide the locker room through the turmoil. “I think it was able to speak volumes if a guy in his sixth year who has one more shot to get to the NFL is going to be all in what reasons do I have not to be all in?” Johnson said. Both Kirtz and Johnson seem to be on the same page about rivalry week: this is not business as usual. For Kirtz memories of two lopsided defeats including a 41-3 blowout last year fuel him and his teammates to reclaim the Land of Lincoln trophy and bring the HAT back to Evanston. Johnson said that at his previous stops winning the rivalry game would constitute a successful season but not at NU. However he did admit that keeping the Illini out of postseason play brings a little extra motivation to the Wildcats. “There’s a little bit more chippiness in practice because guys are chomping at the bit” Johnson said. “I think when you add in the fact that we can keep them out of bowl eligibility I think that’s something that we’d love to be able to hold over them for the next year.” Despite all attention being on Illinois both were giddy about the chance to play in a bowl game. Although having played 11 years of college football combined the pair only has one bowl game appearance — the Citrus Bowl in 2020. The only time Johnson was on a bowl-eligible team was 2018 but he redshirted that season. With Northwestern’s bowl game being Johnson’s and possibly Kirtz’s last college football game both adamantly stated that they would don the purple and white one more time. “To have one last get-go with this group everyone is pretty excited” Kirtz said. While Kirtz mulls whether to join Johnson and declare for the NFL Draft there is one thing for certain heading into the final week of the regular season: when Kirtz sits down for Thanksgiving dinner at Johnson’s apartment much like in between the white line he’s expecting the duo to feast. “You got to have the stuffing with the cranberries on top” Kirtz said emphatically. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story In honor of it being Thanksgiving Day we wanted to take some time to give thanks after a crazy year. Of course we want to thank all of you for taking time out of your day to read our work and your support of student journalism.  Iggy Dowling: Support in high-intensity situations To say this calendar year has been eventful for Northwestern Athletics would be a gross understatement. The same goes for us here and I’m sure many of our readers share that feeling as a part of this community. I’ve been tasked with learning how to be a leader through the highest of highs (trying not to lose my mind running coverage as men’s basketball’s upset over No. 1 Purdue unfolded) and the lowest of lows (trying to physically function in July while pulling all-nighters putting up unholy amounts of screen time working two other jobs and co-monitoring/co-overseeing coverage for the Northwestern football and baseball scandals at the exact same time). I’d be lying if I told you I was ready for all of that I’d be lying if I told you I didn’t make mistakes and I’d sure as hell be lying if I told you I wasn’t constantly stressed out and second-guessing everything I did in small situations and big ones. However what all of this has helped me do is grow professionally (and I’m not even looking to be a journalist) socially and emotionally. I would not be getting through it without the talented people on this site right there with me. Bradley Locker: A long-awaited sense of normalcy and stability July was only a little over four months ago but in many ways it feels like years have passed since Pat Fitzgerald was initially suspended. After so many horrible details emerged exposing a sexual and graphic nature of hazing not to mention abuse in multiple Northwestern sports I genuinely doubted if Wildcat Athletics would feel the same for quite a while. It’s not as if everything has returned to normal nor should it. Lawsuits are still making their way through legal proceedings and rulings could affect people who still are employed by the university. A non-zero number of NU fans are still irate over Fitzgerald being fired and that quantity is even bigger regarding expressing disdain for Derrick Gragg and Michael Schill. There’s still healing that needs to be done for victims of hazing and to ensure atmospheres that have both a zero-tolerance policy and the adequate framework for effectively reporting such behaviors. At the same time the success of several Northwestern sports has seemingly united the community after such divisive and upsetting times. Wildcat field hockey culminated another unbelievable year with a third straight trip to the National Championship and enjoyed a 20-game win streak. Northwestern football against all odds will play in a bowl game and now has its next head coach solidified. Even with the start of basketball buzz can already be sensed around Chris Collins’ team. Not everything is perfect still and a significant number of deep-seated questions still need to be answered. But it’s awfully refreshing to have Northwestern making positive impressions rather than conjuring further skepticism to be writing about student-athletes and coaches earning wins rather than about how they may have violated basic physical moral and ethical standards. David Gold: The Evanston City Council After 40 hours and two months maybe the true new Ryan Field is the memories and friends we made along the way. In all honesty I never need to sit through that again. ""Sophia Vlahakis: Northwestern womens sports"" In back-to-back quarters I’ve made it to two Final Fours and two championships between lacrosse and field hockey. I’m eternally grateful to Inside NU for sending me on these honestly once-in-a-lifetime weekends. But of course it’s the talent of those teams that make it possible.  At the expense of sounding totally cliche but completely truthful it’s magical getting to watch athletes compete at this high of a level. Take lacrosse Izzy Scane is unequivocally one of if not the best players in the country — not just in college. This is the highest quality the sport has to provide.  I fell in love with sports because I love cheering for comebacks the impossible the moments that make the blood sweat and tears worth it. The storylines of individual games are great but they pale in comparison to the athletes themselves. I followed lacrosse and field hockey from the first game of the season up until the end and in the NCAA Tournament I felt the weight of their season’s accomplishments. Hopefully this does not compromise my journalistic integrity but when lacrosse won I felt their pride and when field hockey lost I felt their pain.  It’s a privilege to be a bystander to these teams that quite possibly could not be any better. Whether winning or losing the title there’s nowhere I’d have rather been than physically and emotionally present. I’m just lucky to get to memorialize these programs’ greatness.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The senior has had a somewhat frustrating season carrying the rock for the ‘Cats oftentimes appearing too slow to gain any separation and prone to getting stuffed at the line of scrimmage. But Porter has been running angry lately and he picked up 95 yards on 17 carries last week at home. The previous week against Wisconsin he had 72 yards on 18 carries. Those aren’t world-beater numbers but they are more than serviceable RB1 numbers for a team that needed to establish more of a ground game. If Porter continues to look like he has recently the pressure will be off Ben Bryant in this one. That’s a winning game script for David Braun’s ‘Cats. Joseph Himon II and Anthony Tyus III will be there to help him out but Porter will get the most carries as usual. It’s up to No. 4 to get the run game going in the regular season finale. Northwestern’s pass coverage The ‘Cats have improved against the run but still rank as the conference’s worst run defense allowing 164.3 yards per game. Against the pass however Northwestern ranks sixth in the Big Ten giving up just 177.9 yards per contest. This works out well against the Illini offense a unit that throws the football well and struggles to establish the run. Illinois quarterback John Paddock erupted two weeks ago against Indiana for 507 yards passing and four touchdowns but the Hoosiers are a decidedly poor defensive unit. He fell back down to earth a little bit last week against Iowa posting 215 yards and no scores. Northwestern’s above-average defense against the pass is important in this matchup as it attempts to contain the young gunslinger. Ben Bryant No shade at Brendan Sullivan but it’s hard not to wonder what heights this roster could have reached with Ben Bryant under center all season (yes I know I’m being greedy). The truth is the ‘Cats would likely have had a good shot to win the West and play in an incredibly improbable Big Ten Championship game. But Bryant is healthy now and we’ll take what we can get. His numbers against Purdue don’t blow you out of the water. He was 13-of-24 for 230 yards with one touchdown and a pick. But his ability to throw the ball down the field extends drives at a high rate. Against Illinois the fourth-worst passing defense in the Big Ten Bryant will have opportunities to do just that. His success as always is key to the ‘Cats’ success. Why Northwestern won’t beat Illinois  Isaiah Williams The junior from St. Louis is having a career year racking up 998 yards on 76 receptions and five touchdowns. He is the second leading receiver in the Big Ten behind highly touted NFL Draft prospect Marvin Harrison Jr. over at Ohio State. Williams posted a 200-yard performance two weeks ago against Indiana scoring two touchdowns. He led the team in receiving once again last week against a dominant Iowa defense with 105 yards on eight receptions. The key to slowing Williams down will be for Northwestern’s defensive backs to not only out-physical him but be able to keep up as well. Williams is just 5-foot-10 and 185 pounds so he’s certainly not tiny but he’s not a big go-up-and-get-it receiver either. The ‘Cats have the horses in the secondary to limit him a little but it’s hard to imagine them taking the Illini’s best player completely out of the game. Hunter Renner Bashing the punter is low-hanging fruit but it is also unavoidable at this point. Northwestern is losing the field position battle so often because of bad punts. Renner is averaging 39 yards per punt this season which certainly isn’t good enough but also makes him look better than he’s been. Every game it feels like Renner has at least one complete disaster of a punt. Last week in the second quarter he skied one for just 26 yards out of the ‘Cats’ end zone leaving the defense in a whole world of trouble. Renner is a problem for Northwestern. When you aren’t a dominant offense you have to be able to play the field position battle well. His struggles make that almost impossible.  Motivation To be clear this will likely not be a problem at all but it is worth mentioning. Truthfully there are not a ton of implications for Northwestern in this game. If the ‘Cats win well they’ll play one more game and it will be a bowl. If they lose the exact same thing will happen. There’s nothing to play for from a postseason perspective. However this is a trophy game and it’s rivalry weekend. There’s plenty for Braun and his staff to lean into as they try to motivate these players to play their best game of football. It should be especially easy given the result of this game last year (which I won’t discuss any further so as to save us all from the pain). This is just a minor concern. If Braun gets his guys up for this game the fact that there are no real implications won’t matter. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story This Thanksgiving Northwestern can be thankful that this Saturday’s game will not be the last of the year — the ‘Cats will be playing in a bowl game. For now they take on Illinois for rivalry week holding a chance to end their bowl aspirations with a big win. Here are three matchups to track as you watch Northwestern’s last regular season game of the 2023 season.  Illini interior defensive linemen Johnny Newton and Keith Randolph — dubbed the “law firm” by Illinois head coach Bret Bielema last season — will play one last game together against Northwestern on Saturday. Both members of the powerful defensive duo will declare for the upcoming NFL draft (Newton a projected first round pick) leaving a gaping hole in the middle of the Illini defense.  In 2022 the Illini were No. 3 in total defense and No. 1 in scoring defense much thanks to the commanding presence of Newton & Randolph. Newton was the star of the show finishing the year with 59 pressures and 13 tackles for no gain or a loss but Randolph brought his own flair finishing eighth among Power Five defensive tackles in run-defense grade.  The Illinois defense hasn’t been quite the same this year but opponents have still felt the law firm’s presence. The two have combined for almost 100 tackles and 7 sacks on the season and have given opposing coordinators game-planning nightmares all year long. On Saturday it will be intriguing to watch how Northwestern Offensive Coordinator Mike Bajakian handles the law firm. Will he try to bounce Wildcat running backs to the outside? Will he utilize extra blockers potentially sacrificing the advantage in athleticism Northwestern has displayed in recent weeks? Will he just abandon the run game altogether putting further emphasis on Ben Bryant and the air attack? We’ll just have to wait and see.  There is one thing for certain: the Northwestern offense will have their hands full with Newton and Randolph on Saturday. Through their years together at Illinois they’ve earned themselves a catchy nickname and a legacy of excellence. In their final effort against the Wildcats on Saturday the law firm will look to go to court one last time.  The discussion surrounding Northwestern’s victory over Purdue was almost exclusively positive — exactly as it should’ve been. In what was now officially the last game at the old Ryan Field the ‘Cats achieved a feat little thought possible at the beginning of the year — bowl eligibility. It was a great moment for Head Coach David Braun a great moment for the team and an incredible moment for the fans. In all of the well-deserved positive energy a troubling narrative from the game was overlooked Northwestern’s defense surrendered over 300 rushing yards their highest allowed total of the season.  ""Last week Northwesterns defensive line was dominated by Purdue the entire game. The Boilermakers were having their way paving massive holes for the running backs to exploit. Purdue had 11 carries for 10+ yards and it stuck with it all game running the ball 53 times. The ‘Boilermakers control of the ground game kept them close to the ‘Cats despite lackluster QB play and four untimely turnovers. "" Coming off of multiple weeks of improvement the defensive front’s regression against Purdue is a bit concerning. This week the Wildcats face running back Reggie Love who has been very solid for the Illini. Although he hasn’t played enough games to be eligible for the Big Ten leaderboards (due to an October ankle injury) his 5.0 yards per carry would put him tied for 6th in the conference. He has shown the potential to take over games as well — contributing 140 yards and 2 TDs in their overtime win against Indiana.  The Illini have been relying on Love a lot the past few weeks giving him 42 carries in just his last two games. The Wildcats should expect them to do the same on Saturday but they have to be ready for it. They were able to get their win in spite of the poor defense against Purdue but they may not have that same luxury against Illinois.  Where Northwestern may’ve lacked in run defense against Purdue they made up for in almost every other facet of the game. Particularly it was the playmakers on offense that shined. Cam Johnson made multiple highlight reel plays one of them going for 52 yards to the house. A.J. Henning had another nice outing and Bryce Kirtz had a few big gainers of his own proving once again to be one of Northwestern’s most dependable weapons. What has turned out to be a solid receiving corps for Northwestern goes up against an Illinois secondary that has not lived up to last year’s group. Last year the Illini lost three defensive backs to the first three rounds of the NFL draft most notably Devon Witherspoon who went 5th overall to the Seattle Seahawks.  With a much younger group taking the reins Illinois just hasn’t been the same this year ranking ninth in the Big Ten with 6.8 passing yards allowed per play. Northwestern needs to capitalize on this fact and use their WR talent to create some big plays.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Welcome back to the film room everybody. After soundly defeating Wisconsin 24-10 Northwestern returned to Evanston to take on the lowly Purdue Boilermakers. In the final game at Ryan Field not only for 2023 but for eternity the Wildcats eked out a 23-15 victory to secure bowl eligibility. While the ‘Cats emerged victorious NU was outgained by Purdue 443-329. For Northwestern Ben Bryant was under center for his second straight start since returning from an upper-body injury and his first game at Ryan Field since he was knocked out of the Penn State game on September 30th. Bryant who was lights out in his return against the Badgers did not enjoy the same level of success against Purdue. As the ‘Cats turn their attention to Illinois let’s dive into No.2’s performance from the Wildcats’ final home game. The Stats After a strong performance against the Badgers Bryant’s numbers took a slight dip against the Boilermakers. The ‘Cats’ gunslinger finished the game 13-for-25 for 230 yards one touchdown but he also tossed his first interception since week three. For his effort the sixth year earned a 65.5 PFF passing grade. However Bryant’s 52% completion rate was his lowest since the ‘Cats traveled to Durham in mid-September. While he did not find his target at the same pace as the previous week the veteran’s 9.2 yards per attempt was his highest as a Wildcat. According to PFF Bryant made two big-time throws (a pass with excellent ball location and timing generally thrown further down the field and/or into a tighter window) but he had one turnover-worthy play. Unlike against Wisconsin Bryant felt the heat against the Boilermakers. The signal-caller was pressured on over 40% of dropbacks and was sacked five times. When he was under duress Bryant was 3-for-7 with an interception; comparatively the three-time transfer was 10-for-18 for 178 yards and a touchdown averaging nearly 10 yards per attempt. In typical Bryant fashion the veteran pushed the ball down the field. Over half of No. 2’s tosses were more than 10 yards past the line of scrimmage and a receiver hauled in five of the passes. Here is a complete breakdown of every throw from NU’s QB1. While the numbers are always a good launching point the tape will tell the complete story. So let’s dive into the tape from the final 60 minutes at Ryan Field. The Good Against the conference’s worst passing defense Bryant displayed his ability to play at a high level throughout the game. While not perfect Bryant did a lot to inspire confidence for ‘Cats fans. One of Bryant’s best traits is his ability to go through his progression and Saturday was no different. Northwestern’s starting QB used the entire field to his advantage finding the open receiver. This is great recognition pre-snap and great execution post-snap. Purdue runs a corner blitz with the safety rotating over to fill the void. Bryant sees the corner creeping up and knows that Cam Johnson will be wide open. Johnson also understands the coverage and sits in the flat so Bryant can just flick it out. While No. 14 does the rest it is great pre-snap recognition by the sixth year to find the teeth of the blitz and exploit it for a big gain. This is another good example of the veteran working through his progression. Northwestern runs a simple two-receiver concept leaving an extra blocker in to prevent a safety and the Boilermakers counter with Cover One. Bryant initially looks for Johnson on the fly route but Purdue bracketed him with a safety over the top. Realizing that his primary target was swarmed the ‘Cats’ gunslinger reset his feet darted his eyes left and hit Bryce Kirtz in stride for a big gain. He fully understands the progression and knows that the middle of the field has been vacated in man coverage so Kirtz should be open on the deep cross. After six years of college football Bryant understands coverages like the back of his hand and it has paid off for the Wildcats in 2023. One of my biggest qualms with Bryant early in the season was the missed opportunities down the field. Well he fixed that issue on Saturday against Purdue. Bryant dropped a dime to A.J. Henning on this play. Henning runs a deep crosser crossing the face of two safeties. The back safety picks up No. 8 as he crossed into his zone closing the window for Bryant to put the ball in. However with a clean pocket No. 2 uncorks a throw right on the sideline placing it where only Henning can grab it. Both transfers struggled to get on the same page earlier this season but finally found their rhythm over the past two weeks. This could not have been a better throw from NU’s QB1 and he’s had multiple phenomenal tosses since returning from injury. The Bad Even though the ‘Cats emerged victorious Bryant left some to be desired against Purdue. Northwestern’s signal caller made a few mistakes that let the Boilermakers hang around. When it looked like Northwestern was going to cruise to victory Bryant gave Purdue life in the fourth quarter. On the previous set of downs Mike Bajakian’s unit ran the ball on three straight downs; yet on the next play Bryant puts the ball in the air. It was a confusing play sequence to say the least especially since it appeared NU was going into its four-minute offense. While the play calling was questionable so was this decision from Bryant. No. 2 called the play “dumb” during the postgame press conference and he was correct.  Purdue once again played man and Northwestern ran multiple vertical routes. Bryce Kirtz ran a double move and beat the cornerback. However Bryant was late to get the ball out allowing the safety to range over to make a play on the ball. The Wildcats could have run more time off the clock; instead Bryant gifted the Boilermakers a possession and Purdue scored on that drive. It was a bad decision that kept Purdue alive in the game. Final Thoughts Even in a mediocre performance Bryant still played better than most Northwestern quarterbacks under Mike Bajakian. This offense looks much better when the sixth-year is under center and it is in good hands as the ‘Cats look to reclaim the HAT this weekend.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Another week another split from the Wildcats. On Northwestern volleyball’s 4-game road trip the team went 2-2. NU lost to No. 1 Nebraska and No. 14 Penn State winning one set against Nebraska and none against Penn State; however the ‘Cats dominated Iowa and Rutgers. These past two weeks were a microcosm of the season: virtually non-competitive games against the cream of the crop in the country and usually beating the teams the ‘Cats should. Let’s examine the details of a couple of these games. Northwestern played with heart against undefeated Nebraska and one may even consider this game a moral victory. The ‘Cats were on the road in a packed gym as fans decked in red and white were in almost every set. In set one Northwestern almost stole the match opener leading 22-19 but a series of blocks by the Cornhuskers forced the set into extra points. The ‘Huskers flexed their muscle to close the set out 28-26. In set two NU played what could be considered its best set of the year. Despite trailing 10-4 to begin the set the ‘Cats battled all the way back going on a 15-6 run to take the lead 17-15. However the Cornhuskers looked destined to take the set leading 23-20; yet the Wildcats rattled off four straight points to regain a 24-23 advantage and a Maddy Chinn block handed Northwestern a 26-24 set victory stunning the ‘Husker faithful.  After dropping a rare set at home Nebraska displayed why it is the No. 1 team in the country. The ‘Cats were killed in all facets of the game especially at the net as multiple kills were rejected by UNL. It was never close with the Cornhuskers cruising to a 25-11 set victory. However in set four again the heart of Northwestern was evident again. The teams continued to trade runs throughout the set with NU trailing by as little as 17-15 late in the set; however a 4-0 run put this set out of reach. While the Wildcats tried to mount one last comeback Nebraska closed out the set and the match with a 25-20 victory.  Julia Sangiacomo finished with 16 kills which led both teams. Moreover Averie Hernandez had 13 kills which matched Nebraska’s kill leader. Ellee Stinson also showed out recording 15 digs to lead both teams. Nebraska only beat NU down in one aspect of the game: blocks. The Huskers’ size and athleticism earned them 28 total blocks whereas the ‘Cats only secured 19.  Fresh off the Nebraska loss Northwestern headed on the road to take on Iowa. It got the job done against a hapless Hawkeyes team securing a 3-0 win to snap the three-match losing streak. The first set was extremely tight. NU appeared to have it in hand after going up 22-18 but a couple of errors put Iowa right back in the game. It evened it up and when Northwestern had a 24-23 set point Bailey Ortega evened it back up. From there though back-to-back kills from Hernandez and Rousseau gave the Wildcats a 26-24 win. It was relatively smooth sailing from there with Northwestern earning two 25-21 set wins to clinch the match. Four-point and five-point midgame runs put the ‘Cats in the driver’s seat and they capitalized. Northwestern didn’t statistically dominate but it did outplay Iowa in every facet. Sangiacomo led everyone with 15 kills while Hernandez was the only other player in double digits with 11. Chinn recorded six blocks Rousseau racked up 35 of Northwestern’s 41 assists and Stinson had 14 digs. Northwestern headed back out east a few days later and again took care of business as the favorites with a 3-1 win. Rutgers entered this match 2-14 in Big Ten play but it drew first blood with a 25-23 first set victory. Taylor Humphrey secured the win with five kills in the set and she two of those five earned the Scarlet Knights their final two points. That lit a fire under the ‘Cats who ripped off three consecutive set wins. They became increasingly dominant as the game drew on winning those sets 25-19 25-17 and 25-16 respectively. After Rutgers recorded a 36.8% hitting percentage in the first set its marks in the final three were 10% 21.1% and 0%. On the other hand NU hovered around 35% throughout. Additionally Northwestern’s kill percentage improved as the game drew on peaking at over 55%. That was largely due to another terrific game from Sangiacomo who led everyone with 24 kills for her sixth 20-kill match of the season. Hernandez added 12 and Stinson recorded 21 digs. The ‘Cats went on the road against one of the best teams in the country in No. 14 Penn State who earned Big Ten Team of the Week. NU fared overall pretty badly in comparison to its game against Nebraska. Earlier in September the Wildcats played the Nittany Lions and got swept at home. The first set was all Penn State. PSU came out with conviction and got ahead of the ‘Cats very quickly. The Nittany Lions ended up winning the first set 25-15. However in the second and third sets NU put up a good fight against Penn State. The ‘Cats lost the second set 25-23 and were up for most of the third set before PSU made a run in the final few points to win the set 25-22.  Similar to the Nebraska game Northwestern had trouble at the net. Penn State outdid the Wildcats in blocks. Furthermore Penn State’s attack percentage surpassed Northwestern’s by more than a tenth of a percent; the Nittany Lions had a .293 attack pct while NU had .175. This effect was evident in the statline as NU had no game leaders in aces kills blocks or assists. Sangiacomo led the team with 10 kills yet it was clearly not enough to boost the ‘Cats to victory. Stinson was a bright spot on the stat sheet. She had 12 digs to lead the game. The Wildcats finish their season with two games at Welsh-Ryan Arena. They play Iowa Friday night and Illinois Saturday night. Iowa should be rather a non-contest. Iowa is winless (0-18) in Big Ten play and NU swept the Hawkeyes as aforementioned 3-0 on Nov. 12 in Iowa. The Illinois game is the perfect opportunity for the Wildcats to finish the season on a high note and avenge a 3-0 loss on Nov. 1 in Champaign. The Wildcats are very unlikely to earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament but the Fighting Illini are fighting for their playoff hopes. They are 11-7 in the Big Ten often regarded as the best conference in volleyball and rank sixth. The Wildcats likely have a great chance to play spoilers for their in-state rivals which would be a great ending to the season and the careers of the seniors on Senior Day. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Share this story After going 8-4 and fielding one of the better defenses in college football last year Illinois has had to swallow a tough dose of reality in 2023. The Fighting Illini sit at 5-6 with a 3-5 conference mark and Bret Bielema’s team has varied greatly on a week-to-week basis. Following a narrow loss to No. 16 Iowa learn more about the team Northwestern faces to end every regular season from Adam Rosen The Daily Illini’s assistant sports editor. INU: Illinois was expected to regress slightly following so much talent departing but not to this degree. What would you attribute as to why things have gone south for Bret Bielema in Year Three? Adam Rosen: I think the offense has been troublesome due to many factors inexperience and new faces on the line. The defense is struggling mightily because of inexperience in the secondary and learning a new defense. INU: Who’s starting at quarterback Saturday versus who you think it should be? AR: It is Paddock confirmed but I believe it should be Altmyer. I believe he has more physical ability to move around and I think he’s more dangerous. INU: In Aaron Henry’s first year as DC the Illini defense has taken multiple major steps back. What have been the major areas of weakness? AR: Discipline has been problematic. Look no further than the Indiana game: 14 penalties and just an inexperienced secondary. INU: Isaiah Williams has been on a tear as of late. What sparked his late surge and what makes him stand out as a receiver? AR: He’s not only a great player but a great leader. He’s so vocal. He talked at Media Day in July about being in that leadership position and using it to speak to his teammates and promote healthy relationships and better play. He’s an incredible player but better man. And his teammates trust him. He’s elusive. INU: How important is keeping the HAT to Illini players/making bowl eligibility in such a wayward season? AR: Has to be important. In a year of ugliness making a bowl can right some of the wrongs even if it covers up a lot of weaknesses. It means a lot to fans and players. Nonetheless Bielema has been by far the best Illini coach in a long time. INU: Who wins and by what score? AR: Illinois is hungrier and it’ll win by three. 21-18 Illini.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Northwestern cross country wasn’t able to earn a second consecutive bid to the NCAA Cross Country Championships last Saturday as a team but junior Ava Earl made its presence felt. After qualifying for Nationals individually at Midwest Regionals the week prior she placed 64th out of 254 runners in Charlottesville Virginia with a 20:24 time over 6K to cap off the season.  Early’s finish marked the second-best race by a Northwestern runner at NCAAs ever. The only athlete above her on that list is Aubrey Roberts who came 18th in 2018 and is NU’s only cross country All-American. The meet took place at Virginia’s Panorama Farms course which Earl (and Northwestern) already had some experience with. About two months earlier the Wildcats participated in the Virginia College & Open Invitational which served as a Nationals preview for many of the nation’s best teams. They came 14th out of 23 schools while Earl came in 66th overall. The thing was that September meet was a 5K race while the NCAA meet took place over the standard 6K distance. Panorama Farms is all-grass no matter the distance but the extra kilometer (which falls late in the race’s third mile) had some hills and a few extra turns. That didn’t just add intrigue for how Earl’s race would go. It was something to keep an eye on for the other 11 teams that took part in the early-season race and qualified for NCAAs. Like the majority of the field Earl got out very quickly largely because of the race’s downhill start. She went through the opening kilometer right in the middle of a huge pack in an even three minutes which put her in 61st place. However the ensuing action at the front of the race quickly reverberated through its middle.   To give some context to that it was a foregone conclusion going into the race that the individual title would come down to two runners: Florida’s Parker Valby and defending national champion Katelyn Tuohy of North Carolina State. The two had duked it out in Stillwater Oklahoma last year when Valby made space with an early surge before Tuohy came from behind to catch her in a thrilling race. The Gator stuck to that strategy en route to her victory last Saturday making two huge moves on downhills at the 1K and 1.4K marks. That in turn strung out the entire field in a hurry. The individual contenders were trying to keep Valby in reach without making an effort to up an already-blistering pace while middle scorers for team contenders like Northern Arizona focused more on racing conservatively maintaining their spots and packing up with teammates to pick up crucial points later on. With big decisions to be made as gaps rapidly formed many runners in the middle responded to the chaos by surging forward to latch to packs in front of them. That left Earl in 115th at 2K. From there though the junior really began to respond well. It became pretty clear in the fourth kilometer that Earl hadn’t lost steam in that second K; she had just stayed patient. Earl and a couple of other runners stuck in a big pack behind 100th place at 2K — namely Colorado’s Karrie Baloga and BYU’s Carlee Hansen — worked off each other to gradually pick off runners who had made moves too early. Earl moved up a combined 18 spots in the middle two kilometers and entered the top 100 with a 13:30 time through 4K. The best was yet to come. Remember that extra kilometer compared to September? It came right here and the race was set to climb up 30 feet in elevation without any long downhills. Earl responded by moving up 23 places and sneaking into the top 75. After hitting a physical wall a few weeks prior down the stretch at the Big Ten Championship another race that had a quick start making this move had to feel incredible. No runner behind her ran a faster fifth kilometer which speaks volumes given the quality of the field. Even better Earl’s 23-spot climb was the second-largest positive move in the top 75 and the third-largest in the top 100. Only Oklahoma State’s Gabija Galvydyte who moved up a ridiculous 40 spots in the fifth kilometer and picked up another 20 points in the final one to take 48th topped her.  The Northwestern junior went through the 5K marker in 17:06 a full 14 seconds faster than her 5K race result at Panorama Farms in September. A big 6K PR was almost certainly going to come. Earl didn’t just hold on. She kept moving up delivering a 3:18 closing kilometer to catch 10 more runners and take 64th. She came through the line in 20:24 which was good for an 18-second 6K personal best. In fact Earl was just three spots away from beating Ohio State’s Addie Engel the back-to-back Big Ten individual champ. Relative to other sports cross country training places a huge onus on peaking in the postseason and Earl had certainly made that training pay off. It marked a nice end to a somewhat disappointing season for Northwestern. With a top-30 national ranking early in the season Northwestern had hoped to make another NCAA appearance as a team after racing at the title meet for the first time in 20 years in 2022. However the emergence of No. 20 Iowa State made an automatic Midwest Regional berth unattainable and the path to an at-large bid appeared cloudy without junior Anna Hightower in the lineup the entire season.  There were positives though. Northwestern held its own as the No. 6 team in the Big Ten (just two points back of fifth) even without running a great race at the conference meet. First-year Anna Delgado has already stepped up as a key scorer and Katherine Hessler had a breakout season that culminated in a big performance at Big Tens. It’s evident that 2022 was not a major fluke and that Jill Miller’s team is capable of finishing in the top half of the Big Ten and the top of the Midwest Region for years to come. Whether it can possess enough top-end talent to earn another Nationals bid — and get there consistently — remains to be seen but NU’s future continues to look as bright as it ever has in its program’s history.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story With only two games left in Northwestern’s 2023 season the race to the top of our Inside NU staff picks is heating up — including the top two selectors disagreeing this week. Will the Wildcats snatch back the HAT or will the Illini win three straight games over Northwestern? Our writers weigh in. Iggy Dowling: Northwestern 20 Illinois 17 ""Illinois has the second-worst turnover margin in the Big Ten at -6 and Northwestern ranks third behind Michigan and Penn State with a +8 difference. Its why the Wildcats have clinched a bowl game already and I think itll be why David Braun will close out his first regular season at the helm with a victory in Champaign. The HAT is coming back and a trip to Nashville will await."" Bradley Locker: Illinois 27 Northwestern 23 You can tell that Northwestern is actively seeking to amend its very bad play against Illinois the last two seasons and to get the HAT back. Based on the trajectory of what NU has accomplished this year to reset expectations plus the Wildcats being a more cohesive team than the Illini that should come true. But every Northwestern game leaves me even more confused and unable to explain what transpired than the next. The Wildcats have fundamentally gotten lucky a few times over; almost no team is going to score only 15 points by posting over 440 yards. In a zany game (fitting to end the Big Ten West) Illinois finds a way to get to bowl eligibility — probably because of a massive afternoon from Isaiah Williams and creating problems up front in the swan songs for Johnny Newton and Keith Randolph. Detroit here we come. David Gold: Northwestern 24 Illinois 17 Is part of this to jump Bradley in the standings? Absolutely; however I truthfully believe that the Wildcats have a better team. Last year Illinois stifled NU all day forcing six turnovers in a 41-3 trouncing. I’m sure that I was one of the few people who voluntarily watched that game a second time so I’m sure the ‘Cats are eager for revenge. This year the Illini’s defense is not nearly as talented especially in the secondary. Northwestern will struggle up front against Johnny Newton and Keith Randolph but I think Ben Bryant will have a big day and Cam Johnson will find the end zone for the fourth straight game.  On the defensive side Northwestern has a lot to clean up after allowing 300 rushing yards last week; however luckily for the Wildcats the Fighting Illini prefer to put the ball in the air instead of on the ground. The ‘Cats will have to contain Isaiah Williams who has torched Big Ten defenses all season. It won’t be pretty but the Wildcats will do just enough to reclaim the HAT and prevent Illinois from bowling. For the love of god please play the Pinstripe Bowl. Ethan Segall: Northwestern 23 Illinois 18 The HAT is coming home. This will be the game where David Braun clinches Big Ten Coach of the Year as Illinois has been a mind-bogglingly inconsistent team all season especially at home. Expect Northwestern to do everything possible to keep Jer’Zhan Newton out of the game in his final action of his collegiate career. I think the Northwestern passing offense will do just enough to escape with the road win. Natalie Wells: Illinois 17 Northwestern 16 A fitting conclusion to a rollercoaster of a regular season. Illinois quarterback Luke Altmyer has flipped a switch as of late throwing seven touchdowns to just two interceptions in his last three games. The job that David Braun has done with the ‘Cats this year is astounding but the offense is still maddeningly inconsistent. I can’t predict a seventh win in good faith but I’m proud of the product that we’ve seen from NU this fall.  Ascher Levin: Northwestern 21 Illinois 14 After two solid wins in a row Northwestern is looking to continue its momentum against Illinois. The Fighting Illini have won two of their last three games led by quarterback John Paddock. However it is undecided whether Paddock or Luke Altmyer will start. The key for Northwestern’s defense will be limiting wide receiver Isaiah Williams. Williams has been one of the best receivers in college football this year with 998 receiving yards. On the offensive side Northwestern’s offensive line will need to have a great game against defensive linemen Jer’Zhan Newton and Keith Randolph Jr. The ‘Cats have gotten dominated in their last two games against Illinois but I have Northwestern winning the game and in the process denying Illinois bowl eligibility. Ashleigh Provoost: Northwestern 27 Illinois 20 Even though NU has struggled with stopping the run game Illinois has had notable running back troubles recently — this is only going to contribute to the Northwestern advantage. I’m ready for the perfect ending to this miracle season: the Wildcats denying the Fighting Illini bowl eligibility in their final game during rivalry week. Brendan Preisman: Northwestern 24 Illinois 21 The Wildcats are going to a bowl game but the dream season wouldn’t be complete without the HAT coming back home to Evanston. The key to this game is going to be third downs. Northwestern is fifth in the Big Ten in third down conversion rate at 41.5%. Illinois’ defense is second from the bottom in the conference at stopping third down conversions. The Illini allow opponents to convert 44.5% of their third downs — only Minnesota is worse at getting off the field. I expect Ben Bryant and the offense to convert enough of the money downs to walk away with the HAT — and a seven-win regular season.  Adam Beck: Northwestern 24 Illinois 20 Let the storybook season continue! Who would’ve thought the ‘Cats would be 6-5 with a chance to play the role of spoiler on the road in Champaign to deny the Fighting Illini bowl eligibility? Northwestern will get out to an early start thanks to two quick Ben Bryant shots to Bryce Kirtz and Cam Johnson for scores. Illinois will respond to make things close and with the Fighting Illini trailing by four in the waning moments a big defensive stop will stymie Illinois’ bowl hopes and bring the HAT back to Evanston.

Share this story In yet another game Northwestern was at the hands of an offensive rampage. In the consolation game of the Ball Dawgs Classic in Las Vegas Belmont (3-3 0-0 MVC) shot almost 60% from both the field and three-point land to dominate the Wildcats (3-3 0-0 B1G) in a 83-61 romp. A balanced attack propelled the Bruins who had five scorers reach double figures. Kendal Cheeseman led the way with 21 points on 6-of-9 shooting including four three-pointers on seven attempts. Other double-digit scorers included Jailyn Banks (16) Tessa Miller (13) as well as Kilyn McGuff and Tuti Jones who scored 10 apiece. Jones put up a double-double as she racked up 10 assists. For Northwestern Hailey Weaver led the scoring attack with 13 points all of which came in the first half. Casey Harter dropped 12 Caileigh Walsh scored 11 and Melannie Daley deposited 10. Belmont raced out to a quick start as McGuff opened the scoring with a three-pointer following Cheeseman’s rejection of Paige Mott’s layup attempt. After another bucket from McGuff a Cheeseman layup and another trey by Jailyn Banks off a Daley turnover the Bruins found themselves with a 10-0 lead just over two minutes into the game. It forced Joe McKeown to use his first timeout. The stoppage appeared to help NU’s offense as Daley and Weaver got on the board with back-to-back jumpers. Following a floater from Daley — who ended up with the ball after it bounced off Caroline Lau’s foot — the Wildcats had cut the early deficit to four. However Lau committed two straight turnovers which led to back-to-back buckets for Belmont and brought the Bruins’ lead to 14-6. Weaver and Daley continued to buoy the ‘Cats on the offensive end. No. 11 sandwiched a Tessa Miller layup with a three-pointer and a second-chance bucket while Daley drained a midrange before feeding Mercy Ademusayo for a post hook. Belmont was just as hot offensively though as a trey from Claire Hyde and a few makes from Tessa Miller kept its lead at eight with a minute left in the first quarter. Jones made another pull-up jumper after Harter made a pair of free throws which left Belmont with a 27-17 lead at the end of the first quarter. The Bruins were shooting over 57% and exposed NU’s perimeter defense. To make matters worse Lau and Caileigh Walsh had each picked up two fouls in the first quarter. The Bruins picked up right where they left off ripping off a 7-0 run to start the second period. Cheeseman punctuated that stretch with an easy layup to go up by 17 which prompted McKeown to use another timeout. Again Weaver provided a nice response as she cashed in her second three-pointer to reach 10 points on the day. Harter and Weaver both scored on the next two possessions giving Northwestern a 7-0 run of its own. Weaver’s layup extended her scorching-hot start to 12 points in 12 minutes on a perfect 5-of-5 mark from the field. For the first time all night the scoring quieted but Belmont’s Camryn Harrison ended a minute of scoreless play with an and-one. Cheeseman hit a three-pointer in between layups from Daley and Jasmine McWilliams which kept the Bruins’ lead at 40-28 with 3:39 remaining in the half. Harter then converted another bucket to cut NU’s deficit to 10 before some free throws on both ends and a heavily-contested jumper from Jones closed out the half. Belmont held a 43-31 lead at the break and was still shooting almost 60% from the field even though just 16 of those 43 points came inside the paint. The Bruins made five of its 10 three-pointers. After Lau had turned it over twice Harter handled most of the floor general duties in the second quarter. The first-year played 14 minutes in the first half while Lau — who picked up two fouls early — played just six. Walsh and Miller exchanged buckets to open the second half and another layup from the Northwestern big trimmed the Belmont lead to 10. A couple of misses on both ends preceded another McGuff three as well as Miller’s 10th and 11th points of the night which put the Bruins up 51-35. Mott responded with a layup but Weaver fouled Cheeseman on an ensuing three-point attempt to give the Bruin three easy makes at the charity stripe. Cheeseman drew another foul on Mott a few possessions later and made another pair of free throws to help extend Belmont’s lead to 20 points with 4:27 in the third quarter. However a trey from Alana Goodchild — as well as a layup and a three from Walsh — sparked an 8-2 Northwestern run. A Cheeseman three-pointer stymied it but Daley and Harter both converted field goals to cut Belmont’s lead to 64-49. A few seconds later Daley suffered what appeared to be a leg injury and checked out. She would later return to the game. The Bruins further dampened NU’s mood as Cheeseman and Banks made yet another pair of shots from deep. Despite a layup from Walsh — which gave her 11 points for the quarter — Belmont maintained a 70-51 edge at the end of the third quarter. It only got worse for the ‘Cats as the Bruins opened the fourth with seven straight points. Harter briefly paused the run with a fastbreak hook shot but some more buckets from Banks extended the Belmont lead to 28 points. From there both teams began to empty their benches to wrap up Northwestern’s third loss in four games.

Share this story If you tuned in to any second of the battle for the Land of Lincoln Trophy Saturday on Big Ten Network two things probably resonated with you. Indeed it was the Wildcats who came out on top from one of the wilder contests they’ve ever played winning a 45-43 thriller in a more fitting sendoff to the mortal PAC-12 than to the Big Ten West. A major reason why NU claimed the HAT was that characteristic intensity which never wavered despite a) largely playing for a better bowl matchup and b) a cavalcade of craziness. To write that either team played “well” on Saturday in spite of the scoreboard probably wouldn’t be accurate; after all there were six combined turnovers and consistent defensive lapses. The most unbelievable one came in the final seconds of the game with Illinois’ John Paddock hitting Casey Washington for an 80-yard touchdown to bring the Illini within two with just 55 ticks left. Yet the next play encompassed why Northwestern found a way to emerge victorious effectively the central tenet for its improbable season. On the game-tying two-point conversion it seemed as if Bryce Gallagher hooked Washington and yellow laundry even came onto the field — but it was all for naught as Carmine Bastone’s helmet tipped Paddock’s pass allowing the flag to be picked up. Northwestern’s regular-season finale from Champaign was anything but perfect from a purple standpoint (see: Miles Scott’s end-of-half pick six a trick play score from Isaiah Williams to Pat Bryant Ben Bryant’s second interception) especially in surrendering 455 total yards. However as has become the staple under David Braun NU stepped up when it mattered most — even if the ball bounded favorably sometimes. Consider Devin Turner’s PBU leading to a Xander Mueller interception with five minutes to go. Or Anto Saka’s fourth-down sack of Paddock on Illinois’ penultimate drive. Perhaps most critically look at the ‘Cats taking advantage of two Illini special teams fumbles with one being run all the way back into the end zone by Garner Wallace. All those plays proved monumental in deciding the outcome and reflect capitalizing on opponent mistakes. The Wildcats’ seventh win was wildly entertaining a bonafide seesaw classic coming down to the literal last few seconds. The victory didn’t just spike fans’ heart rates across the state: it reflects the strides made in just four months under Braun. For the first time in two years Northwestern was able to take back the HAT to Evanston. Pure euphoria from players coaches and even staffers manifested itself for hours after the game ended in Memorial Stadium. In reality those two capless seasons felt like an eternity with Illinois absolutely dominating the purple and white from 2021-22. Saturday proved cathartic exorcising demons against the team’s principal rival and showcasing that the Wildcats can control the state’s bragging rights to Illinois recruits. On top of adding a key trophy to the program’s mantle NU reinforced that recent evisceration at the hands of traditional divisional foes — namely Wisconsin Purdue Minnesota and Illinois — need only be a short-term phenomenon. That slight glimmer of hope to remain competitive in the conference was almost undetectable following last season but it’s returned in full under Braun. Overarchingly the swing from a possible record of 6-6 to 7-5 may not appear enormous on paper. Yet that number in the lefthand column guarantees a winning season for Northwestern and puts it in somewhat exclusive company. Only seven of 14 Big Ten teams accomplished that feat with three of them playing in the West. More broadly just 35 other Power Five teams reached that mark making NU part of the favorable 52.9% with 7+ wins. Among the programs as which Northwestern had the same or better record: The disparity between NU and the others in recruiting prowess NIL funding and overall panache stands out but nothing is more important than this: the Wildcats accomplished more or the same as these once-thought-of powerhouses after going 1-11 and not winning a game in America for almost two years. Fundamentally many Northwestern fans considered 2023 to be a year worth fast-forwarding circling Nov. 26 on their calendars to get through the throes of another miserable season. Instead that day has arrived and the program’s trajectory is fully upstart; few want this year to end. Subsequent to a 4-20 mark supporters of the purple and white were viscerally concerned with how if at all Northwestern could survive in a cannibalistic unstable college football environment. It seemed like a long-term restoration was both imminent and necessary full of deep-seated reflection about the school’s values juxtaposed with attaining modern success. Instead after just 12 games of Braun at the helm that development has been rapidly accelerated — indicating both the haste of the ability to change in the sport as well as that the Wildcats can make the most of the talent that exists on their roster because of excellent coaching at multiple levels. As we await NU’s bowl game destination (likely out on the West Coast it would appear) shifts will inevitably arrive regarding the team’s staff and roster some widely expected but others out of left field. The bottom line after 12 games under Braun though is that Northwestern has extricated itself from a two-year purgatory that looked permanent — through wild contests and a complex hazing scandal with a hard hat on its head. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This season is coming to a close just as quickly as it began and once again it was a Big Ten football season we won’t soon forget. It is bittersweet writing this as starting today the conference will begin to change in ways that once seemed unimaginable. Luckily this conference blessed us one last time with classic Big Ten tradition before we enter the new age of college football. From one last winner-take-all edition of The Game to one last hurrah from the wackiest division in all of college football this weekend gave us everything we could have asked for in terms of both a rivalry week and a swan song. But before we say goodbye to the Big Ten as we know it let’s take one last look Around the Big Ten in 2023. The Game This year’s edition of The Game was billed as one of the biggest regular season matchups in college football history. Everything was on the line from a Big Ten East title to a spot in the Big Ten Championship Game and most importantly a chance to remain undefeated and on track for a College Football Playoff berth. And boy did this one live up to the hype. No. 3 Michigan had the last laugh winning 30-24 over No. 2 Ohio State but the game was tight throughout. Despite Michigan never trailing in this one the Buckeyes kept it close all game and had a chance to win on their final drive. Those chances were dashed by Michigan safety Rod Moore a former four-star recruit out of Ohio when he picked off a pass by Ohio State quarterback Kyle McCord with 25 seconds remaining sealing the win for the Wolverines in the process. Moore was one of a few standouts for the Wolverines with running back Blake Corum and cornerback Will Johnson among the others. Their contributions in addition to leading Michigan to victory also helped lead the team to where it stands right now; a win over No. 17 Iowa away from a third straight playoff appearance. As for Ohio State its chances of reaching the playoffs took a significant hit but much to the chagrin of others are yet to have reached zero. Wins by Georgia and Michigan paired with losses by Florida State and Texas in their respective  conference championship games would leave the Buckeyes in prime position to earn yet another playoff berth. For bragging rights and bowl eligibility Three Big Ten teams all out of the Big Ten West went into the final week of the regular season with the chance to clinch bowl eligibility and collect wins over their rivals in the process... and all three teams failed to do so. It started on Friday when Nebraska played host to No. 17 Iowa in “The Heroes Game” and lost 13-10. Then Illinois hosted rival Northwestern in a game they were favored in by 6.5 points and lost 45-43. Minnesota was hoping to beat the rival Badgers at home in an effort to keep possession of Paul Bunyan’s Axe for at least another year and lost 28-14.  For Nebraska and Illinois the losses end their seasons in equally discouraging fashion. The Cornhuskers had reached a massive high point earlier in the season winning three straight games to sit at 5-3 with four games remaining needing just one win to clinch bowl eligibility. Unfortunately they proceeded to lose each of their last four games all by seven points or less to miss out on bowl season. For the Fighting Illini they were 5-5 with two games left to clinch a bowl bid but went on to suffer a pair of heartbreaking losses to Iowa and Northwestern by a combined four points to end the season. Brutal. As for Minnesota the Golden Gophers lucked out as despite the loss to Wisconsin they will be the lone 5-7 team participating in bowl festivities thanks to both a high Academic Progress Rate and this chaotic 51-yard field goal by Hawaii kicker Matthew Shipley which ended Colorado State’s chances at a bowl game. The Battle for the Old Oaken Bucket While the aforementioned rivalry games were for spots in the Big Ten Championship Game or for chances to play in bowl games The Battle for the Old Oaken Bucket was for pure bragging rights. In a lost season for both teams both Indiana and Purdue wanted to take home the trophy awarded to the winner of the fiercest rivalry game in all of Indiana. At the end of the day it was Purdue who maintained possession of the Old Oaken Bucket taking home the win in West Lafayette 35-31. This game was your typical everyday offensive shootout as it went back and forth with no side being able to capture and then hold onto the momentum. However it was the Hoosiers who looked like they had gained control in the second half as they took a 28-18 lead heading into the fourth quarter. It was at that moment that Purdue quarterback Hudson Card decided to call game. Seconds into the fourth quarter Card threw a 38-yard touchdown pass to running back Devin Mockobee to make it 28-25. Then after the teams exchanged field goals Card ran in the game-winning 10-yard rushing touchdown with 2:39 remaining. The Boilermakers would go on to stop the Indiana offense on 4th and 1 on their ensuing possession to clinch victory and put an exclamation point finish on an otherwise disappointing season for both teams.

Share this story After an absolute thriller in Champaign Northwestern will be bringing the hat back to Evanston for the first time in three years. Saturday’s affair was a very different game than what Northwestern fans have become accustomed to with 88 points scored between the two teams. Unlike many ‘Cats games there was plenty of offense — Northwestern scored more points and allowed more points than it has all year. Still there was plenty of room for the defense to shine as the teams also combined for six takeaways. In this year’s battle for the Land of Lincoln Trophy there was a little something for everyone. It was an exciting regular season finale fitting for the impressive 2023 season the Wildcats have had. As the David Braun and the ‘Cats now await their bowl matchup here are five takeaways from their rivalry game against Illinois.  With 1:09 to go in the first half Ben Bryant made his worst throw of the season. Looking for A.J. Henning deep down the left sideline he tossed the football straight into the hands of Illinois defensive back Miles Scott who strolled down the field with ease for a pick-six touchdown. It felt like a devastating blow for Northwestern — Illinois had just gained their first lead of the game and had the Memorial Stadium momentum on their side. With little time remaining in the half the ‘Cats could have very easily let the game go into halftime. After all their quarterback had just thrown a demoralizing pick-six and they were set to receive the second half’s opening kickoff.  Instead head coach David Braun and offensive coordinator Mike Bajakian put together an impressive drive. They put trust in Bryant and Bryant put trust in himself. In less than a minute he completed all four of his pass attempts for 34 yards leading the ‘Cats all the way down the field for a touchdown. It was a huge moment in the game that gave the ‘Cats a burst of energy heading into halftime. Most importantly it showed that Ben Bryant was unfazed by the pick. Watching that last first half drive there would be no way of knowing he had just thrown a crushing interception on the previous drive. As he’s done all season long Bryant carried himself with calmness and confidence in the midst of adversity.  Cam Johnson delivered with his best performance of the year against Illinois. Catching heat throughout the past few weeks Johnson’s effort on Saturday was an exclamation point on what has been a very impressive senior season. He racked up seven receptions and 124 yards both season highs. In the first quarter it was Johnson on the receiving end of Northwestern’s first touchdown jumping in the air to grab a 50/50 ball in the end zone.  Johnson was a consistent option for QB Ben Bryant throughout the game as the ‘Cats frequently took advantage of Johnson’s matchup against a freshman cornerback on the outside. This was especially evident in the third quarter where Bryant connected with Johnson on three consecutive throws including a 42 yard shot down the field that set up a touchdown. It was his best game of the year but for Johnson it was just a display of the encouraging traits he has shown all year: physicality athleticism and chemistry with his quarterback. His versatility as a receiver has been a treat to watch all season and it was fun to see it culminate in a stellar game against Illinois.  Last year Northwestern’s turnover differential was -18: the worst figure in all of FBS. The offense’s inability to hold on to the football plagued them all year and was exacerbated by the fact that the defense could never seem to get it back. The Wildcats’ deep turnover hole was a major reason for their 1-11 record. The ‘Cats only had 12 takeaways and gave the football away 30 times throughout the course of the season. In 2023 Northwestern completely flipped the script finishing the regular season tied seventh in FBS with a +10 turnover margin. The defense improved with 19 takeaways in 2023 and the offense cut down on giveaways by 21 reducing their total to just 9.  Northwestern’s improvement in the turnover department went beyond the scorebooks — it was clear to see the impact throughout some of the season’s biggest moments. In their upset of Maryland back in early October the Northwestern offense played clean with no giveaways and the defense came up with turnovers when it mattered most — a fumble early in the first to set up a score and a game-sealing interception late in the fourth. The ‘Cats replicated that against Purdue coming up with a turnover late in fourth to clinch a victory and bowl eligibility.  In the recent effort against Illinois turnovers once again played a massive role. In the first quarter a Jaheem Joseph interception put the Wildcats in position to score their first touchdown of the game. The special teams unit got in on the fun in the third quarter recovering a muffed punt inside the 20 to set up a ‘Cats touchdown and immediately after returning a fumbled kickoff to the house for six. A bit later in the fourth the ball-hawking defense came up clutch yet again halting Illinois momentum with a Xander Mueller interception that put Northwestern in field goal range. Directly or indirectly turnovers accounted for 24 of Northwestern’s 45 points against Illinois. The Wildcats once again showed how takeaways and ball security an Achilles’ heel for last year’s group have turned into one of their greatest strengths.  Despite two interceptions at the most crucial stages of the game it was an underwhelming day overall for the Northwestern pass defense. The secondary surrendered more than 300 passing yards for the first time this season allowing Illinois QB John Paddock the cushion he needed to get comfortable through the air. They were especially vulnerable whenever Paddock targeted Casey Washington who has typically been the second option for the Illini. On Saturday Washington put up monster numbers with nine receptions 218 yards and three touchdowns and put his talent on full display with a fourth-quarter catch in wide open space that went for 73 yards.  Heading into the matchup against Illinois it is reasonable to assume that Northwestern prepared heavily to face Isaiah Williams the top option for Illinois. Williams finished the regular season with 1055 receiving yards — second in the Big Ten only to Ohio State Heisman hopeful Marvin Harrison Jr. While the ‘Cats kept Williams relatively contained holding him under 60 yards they seemingly forgot about Washington who had a career day.  With a bowl game on the horizon Northwestern must keep its secondary a strength. For most of the season it has been a facet of the game the ‘Cats have been able to count on. If the secondary is not as strong the entire defense suffers. No matter who they play come bowl time it will be vital for the Wildcats to get back to the tight pass coverage we have grown accustomed to.  When rivalry week came around in 2022 many Wildcat fans were weary of a season that felt as if it had already gone on too long. Northwestern hadn’t won in months hadn’t scored over 10 points in weeks and was looking like one of the worst teams in all of FBS on a weekly basis. Even for the most loyal Wildcat fans it was tough to watch. The program was having its worst season in over thirty years so when Illinois trounced all over the Wildcats 41-3 to reclaim the hat for Champaign it was no surprise to most.  This year the energy was completely different entering the battle for The Land of Lincoln Trophy. After clinching bowl eligibility against Purdue Northwestern came into its rivalry game with confidence and momentum. Positive vibes reverberated within the team and throughout the fanbase and Northwestern fought its way to a hard-earned 45-43 victory. The game was action-packed with all sorts of twists and turns that kept fans on the edges of their seats. It had just about anything you could imagine: tons of scoring pick-sixes muffed punts controversial calls you name it. It probably didn’t have to be so close — Northwestern had some opportunities to close it out earlier — but after last season watching entertaining (and winning) Northwestern football is an absolute treat.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story In my first article of the season I mulled the newfound responsibilities and pressures that come with expectations. Given that Northwestern’s fencing unit finished last regular season at No. 4 in the U.S. Fencing Coaches Association Poll and kicked off its 2023 campaign at No. 5 it felt inevitable that it’d be tough to live up to such lofty ambitions. After all the team is led largely by underclassmen and competes in a region that tends to lag behind its New England rivals. All this to say that as some of the ‘Cats dispersed to the November edition of the North American Cup a 5-3 record with each loss coming at the hands of a ranked opponent felt slightly expected.  In an effort to get back on track a flurry of NU’s swords participated in this month’s NAC ultimately flexing inspiring finishes. Though the monthly Cups don’t affect a team’s overall record they serve as benchmarks for athletes to size up their collegiate competitors.  Megumi Oishi who — now in her sophomore year — needs no introduction shined. The sabre took home a third-place finish in the junior division. Behind her was first-year Alex Chen who has consistently impressed through the early goings of her college career. As a collective Northwestern took home fourth in the junior sabre team category thanks to contributions from Adele Bois and Amy Lu.  The other bright spot at the tune-up event was sophomore Anna Damratoski who snatched sixth in the junior epee event. Karen Wang who frequents podiums had a relatively down day coming in 26th (at an event as big as a NAC a No. 20 finish being a “down day” is quite the flex). Juliana Hung a San Francisco product was a bright spot for the foils. The sophomore tallied a 15th-place finish.  The foils were the weakest group for the ‘Cats through the first few weeks of the campaign having been blown out against the likes of No. 4 Harvard and No. 14 Stanford at the Western Invitational. Hung’s outing is a source of optimism for Moss and the rest of the coaching staff. After the November NAC interlude Northwestern got back to organized team play via the Elite Invitational. Shockingly the Ohio-based event featured an even more competitive slate than the Western Invitational did. Among the five teams the ‘Cats faced at the Elite Invite four were ranked — three were in the top 10. As has been the case for much of this season NU dropped nearly all of the close bouts they were in. Whereas it felt like the 2022 run boasted plenty of close wins the purple swords seem to be on the losing end of nearly every close match. The weekend kicked off with a 14-13 loss to No. 7 Penn. On a course for vengeance the foils dominated in the loss beating the Quakers’ unit 6-3. The sabres squeaked out a 5-4 victory but a poor showing from the epees (2-7) lost NU the match. Last year Northwestern’s statement win was against No. 1 Notre Dame in an emphatic 19-8 performance. This year the team got its shot at the consensus No. 1 in Princeton but faced an entirely different outcome losing to the Tigers 15-12. In an unusual outing for the sabres the group went 0-9 essentially making it impossible for the ‘Cats to steal the W. The only reason the final score was close was because the foils clearly determined went on an incredible 9-0 run of their own. A 2-7 going for the epees was the straw that broke the camel’s back handing NU its fourth consecutive loss dating back to the Western Invite. Northwestern picked up its first win of the weekend and its only against a ranked competitor when it got revenge against No. 14 Stanford. Consistency across classes proved key in this one as the epees and foils each went 4-5 while the sabres clutched the victory with a modest 6-3 win. In the last ranked match of the event the ‘Cats took on the Blue Devils but couldn’t seem to pull away. They went 4-5 in every category ultimately resulting in a 15-12 loss. For what it’s worth Moss and Co. handled business 19-8 against a more tame Cleveland State team. The ‘Cats now sit at 7-6 on the season with about half as many losses as they accrued in their entire 2022 56-match regular season when they went 43-13. In fairness there likely isn’t a team in collegiate fencing that can flex the same strength of schedule that Northwestern can. Additionally the Wildcats struggled last year in the Elite Invitational which proved to be a breeding ground for behemoth-on-behemoth matchups. The looming question remains: can NU win against top talent at all let alone consistently? If not title aspirations will continue to remain more than an arm’s length away. Fortunately the Wildcat fencers won’t have to answer that query quite yet as the less important December and January NACs are all that’s on the schedule until mid-January.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Last night was a tale of two halves for the Wildcats. Coming off a loss to Mississippi State Northwestern sought to get itself right before No. 1 Purdue comes to Evanston on Friday. In the first half it did not look as though the team would get itself right. A 42-41 halftime deficit provided tons of questions but most of them were answered as Northwestern ran away with it in the second frame. Here are a few key takeaways from the 89-67 win: Boo Buie is one of the best offensive players in the Big Ten Buie had an absolutely stellar night finishing with 23 points and seven assists both of which led the team. It was a tale of two halves for the team and that was the case for Buie as well. In the first half the point guard was comfortable sitting back and distributing tallying six assists and just five field goal attempts. The spin. The dish. The jam.   : B1G+ pic.twitter.com/XosrgqBFkO A major beneficiary of Buie’s first-half generosity was Matt Nicholson. The big man erupted for his best performance of the season scoring nine points in the first half and 15 in the game. The Buie-Nicholson connection also resulted in a few nice alley-oops throughout the first half and the team was +11 in the first 20 minutes with Buie on the floor.  Of course that meant in the five first-half minutes Buie sat Northwestern was a putrid -12. The offense often went stagnant with Buie sitting and the result was a shocking halftime deficit. No. 0 would not let that stand.  “I was going to make it a point to be aggressive” Buie said of his halftime mentality. “The plan was to score.” And score he did. The graduate student erupted after the break with 16 points on 5-for-6 shooting and 3-for-4 from the charity stripe. Buie’s 32% shooting from beyond the arc last season transformed into a distant memory as he canned four of five looks from beyond the arc. That included this heave from near-parking lot distance in the middle of a 13-2 run. Jimmer Range  @booboo_buie has 10 points in four minutes.    : B1G+ pic.twitter.com/GryWkY9dJ2 In the first half Buie showed off his ability to distribute. In the second he showcased his scoring prowess. The nine-point clunker against Mississippi State was clearly an aberration as Buie now has 15 or more points in every other game this year. If he’s able to keep the three-point and assist numbers up this team is going to be tough for any opponent to stop. Ty Berry is the X-factor (and maybe the third-best guy) Welsh-Ryan Arena may have hit its decibel peak midway through the first half when Berry drained a three-pointer off a feed from (who else?) Buie on a fast break. Not only did the shot go in but NIU guard Zion Russell plowed into Berry meaning the Wildcats would have a four-point play opportunity. Berry would not be the one to convert the free throw though: he turned his ankle on the play and had to go to the locker room. By the time Berry checked back in (over four minutes later) the 22-11 Wildcat lead had been cut to 26-20. The stretch was part of a major NIU run that resulted in the Huskies tying the game at 29 — Berry’s absence was the main reason why. He was the primary defender on NIU’s leading scorer David Coit who had five points during the comeback run (all with Berry off the court). Luckily for Berry and the entire team the ankle was fine and the senior played all but two minutes of the second half. He was a +27 for the final 20 minutes which tied for a team-high and his smothering defense on Coit (who went just 1-for-5 from the field in the second frame) was a big reason why. Berry’s defense also fueled several offensive opportunities especially when he would get a steal on the perimeter like this one. Coast to Coast  12 points and 4 steals for @Ty_Berry3. : B1G+ pic.twitter.com/Tm6UNKojpC The guard would finish the game with 14 points and an eye-popping five steals arguably his best performance of the season to date. After the game Collins called Berry “fantastic” and said that his defense was “on point.” If a player who was top 10 in the Big 10 in steals last year with 1.4 per game can keep up the leather larceny Northwestern’s defense should remain one of the best in the conference. The second unit needs to stay sharp Heading into Monday night Northwestern was one of the worst teams in the country in terms of bench production. The mark of 9.0 bench points per game was the fifth worst in the entire country. But after 22 bench points last night (including 11 from Nick Martinelli) the Wildcats have climbed all the way up to ... twelfth from the bottom at 11.2 bench points per contest. This isn’t new for Chris Collins-led teams. Since 2020 Northwestern has had just two players (2022 Ryan Young and 2023 Brooks Barnhizer) average more than six points per contest while starting less than two games. But this season the non-starters have really struggled to get going. The previous high for bench points was 12 which the team pulled off against Dayton and Rhode Island.  Martinelli could provide a potential fix. As already mentioned he was responsible for half of the team’s bench points thanks to his 5-for-6 shooting night. However that mark isn’t a huge aberration: Martinelli was shooting nearly 48% from the field before Monday a higher clip than any starter but Nicholson.  .@N_Martinelli1 floater. Scheduled tweet.   : B1G+ pic.twitter.com/eJ5jiXP63U The floater is obviously key in Martinelli’s offensive repertoire but he also showcased a deep jump shot that stretched the floor nicely. That included splitting his two attempts from long range (which tied a career-high for a single game) and as evidenced by that clip defenses are beginning to respect the sophomore from farther out. If Martinelli continues to evolve offensively Collins will probably provide him with even more opportunities.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Another week in the NFL another round of games for our NU alumni. Let’s see what the former ‘Cats contributed to their teams on Feast Week.  Rashawn Slater: Los Angeles Chargers OT Slater had a solid game in the Chargers’ 20-10 loss to the Ravens but his fellow O-linemen struggled to give Justin Herbert the time he needed in the pocket. As per usual the third-year tackle played all 66 offensive snaps and continues to be the best lineman on an overall shaky unit. Herbert got sacked three times and felt the pressure from Baltimore all night long. On fourth down with less than two minutes to go Ravens cornerback Arthur Maulet came screaming in on a blitz getting to Herbert before he could react. He threw the ball away before Maulet brought him down but the Chargers turned the ball over on downs as Slater and the O-line failed to pick up the extra rusher. Los Angeles now sits at 4-7 but Slater and his teammates will have a chance to right the ship against the lowly Patriots. Week 13 matchup: at New England Patriots (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Greg Newsome II: Cleveland Browns CB Typically Cleveland’s starting slot corner Newsome moved out to the boundary to fill in for an injured Denzel Ward. He looked uncomfortable in the Browns’ 29-12 loss to the Broncos struggling to guard receiver Courtland Sutton. The 6-foot-4 Sutton has a four-inch advantage on Newsome and it showed Sunday afternoon. Newsome was flagged for pass interference on the Broncos’ opening drive moving Denver a whopping 34 yards down the field. Sutton also shook him at the top of his route for a 31-yard grab on third down. Overall the third-year corner recorded seven tackles five of which were solo and a pass deflection. If Ward misses more time Newsome will have to prove he can translate his elite play from the slot to the outside.  Week 13 matchup: at Los Angeles Rams (Sunday 3:25 p.m. CT) Peter Skoronski: Tennessee Titans OG Skoronski had yet another solid game at left guard in the Titans’ 17-10 win against the Panthers. In 29 pass-blocking snaps the rookie didn’t surrender a single sack or pressure. Overall Tennessee’s entire O-line gave up just one sack to the dynamic edge rusher Brian Burns. Since missing three weeks early in the season after undergoing an appendectomy Skoronski has shown why the Titans took him 11th overall in April. He’s given up just one sack and has been called for one penalty through eight games. Skoronski will be a foundational piece for Tennessee as it evaluates whether to buy or sell this offseason. Week 13 matchup: vs. Indianapolis Colts (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Ben Skowronek: Los Angeles Rams WR Skowronek had yet another quiet week in the Rams’ 37-14 blowout win against the Cardinals. His only contribution wasn’t really a contribution at all — in the first quarter he caught a screen pass on 3rd-and-9 but got stuffed for a loss of one bringing the punt unit onto the field. Over the span of 11 games the third-year receiver has caught just four passes for 32 yards and a touchdown. Skowronek continues to contribute on special teams as a gunner but he hasn’t been in head coach Sean McVay’s plans with the emergence of rookie pass-catcher Puka Nacua. He’ll look to make an impact in any way he can at home against the Browns.  Week 13 matchup: vs. Cleveland Browns (Sunday 3:25 p.m. CT) Adetomiwa Adebawore: Indianapolis Colts DE Despite his limited playing time Adebawore found a way to make a difference in the Colts’ 27-20 win against the Buccaneers. He and Tyquan Lewis took down Baker Mayfield in the third quarter to bring up 2nd-and-17 on a drive that ended in a Tampa Bay punt. With that half-sack Adebawore now has 1.5 sacks in his last three games.  The rookie edge rusher saw the field for just 15 defensive snaps but he made the most of his opportunities. Hopefully the Colts will continue to reward his recent play with more playing time. Adebawore will look to get after fellow 2023 draftee Will Levis in Tennessee on Sunday. Week 13 matchup: at Tennessee Titans (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Blake Hance: Jacksonville Jaguars OL Hance played just one offensive snap in the Jaguars’ 24-21 win against the Texans but it was an important play. He missed a crucial block on a pitch to running back Travis Etienne preventing him from getting into the end zone. It was an example of why he’s best as a backup offensive lineman. The journeyman also played five special teams snaps making his regular contributions to the kicking unit. He’ll aim for a better performance in his sporadic snaps on Monday night against the Joe Burrow-less Bengals.  Week 13 matchup: vs. Cincinnati Bengals (Monday 7:15 p.m. CT) Godwin Igwebuike: Pittsburgh Steelers RB Igwebuike played 14 special teams snaps in the Steelers’ 16-10 win against the Bengals at home. He didn’t return any kicks but he charged hard as a gunner during Pressley Harvin’s punts.  The Steelers opened the season with Anthony McFarland as their starting kick returner but he was a healthy scratch on Sunday afternoon. This is a vote of confidence for Igwebuike’s veteran presence as he has played for six NFL teams and the XFL’s Seattle Dragons since going undrafted in 2018. Igwebuike will stay ready for opportunities to return kicks against the Cardinals on Sunday afternoon. Week 13 matchup: vs. Arizona Cardinals (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Tyler Lancaster: Denver Broncos DT Lancaster was elevated from the Broncos’ practice squad for their 29-12 win against the Browns seeing his first action since Week Six. In 18 defensive snaps the run stuffer notched two solo tackles including a tackle for loss. Signed by the Packers as an undrafted free agent in 2018 Lancaster spent his first four pro seasons in Green Bay. He signed with the Raiders in 2022 but spent the season on the injured reserve before joining the Broncos this year. Lancaster has spent most of his time on Denver’s practice squad but he’ll stay ready if they need him for their road trip to Houston.

Share this story It’s a heartbreaking thing to put down in writing but the Big Ten West has played its final game. After being introduced in 2014 the conference enjoyed a decade of this iteration of the divisional structure and created one of the most chaotic warped and upside-down divisions in college football memory. The Big Ten West best known for punts had a great run even if no teams took home a conference championship. As a tribute to everyone’s favorite division here is the complete ranking of every team esteemed enough to sit upon the throne of the West decided by a multitude of factors. 10. 2022 Purdue Boilermakers (8-6 6-3) The clear choice for the bottom spot is last year’s Purdue squad a team that was never ranked in the AP Poll or CFP all season despite receiving some votes at different points in the season. Although the Boilermakers picked up two ranked wins (against Minnesota and Illinois both ranked No. 21 at the times of the contests) en route to the program’s first conference championship appearance Purdue’s six overall losses are the most of any team on this list. One of those losses includes a 63-7 thrashing against LSU in the Citrus Bowl to end the season on a sour note. Led by the likes of Aidan O’Connell and Charlie Jones there was nothing wrong with this team; it just benefitted from a weak year in the West and isn’t especially memorable. Statistically the Boilermakers were middling in almost all of the important categories with the exception of the passing offense which ranked amongst the conference’s best. This season proved to be Jeff Brohm’s last on the sideline as he took the Louisville job ahead of the Citrus Bowl. 9. 2023 Iowa Hawkeyes (10-2 7-2) Maybe this is the opposite of recency bias but the current Iowa Hawkeyes team stands out as one of the least inspiring teams to represent the West in Indianapolis. This could all change in an instant should Iowa upset Michigan on Saturday becoming the first team from the division to capture the conference crown which would vault the Hawkeyes near the top of the list. But frankly I think that’s unlikely. Despite the ultra-rare decision to fire the offensive coordinator midseason despite a winning record Iowa has remained largely consistent. The team overcame an early-season knee injury to transfer quarterback Cade McNamara and have a truly stifling defense that allows just 12.2 points per game. So why is Iowa so low? For starters the Hawkeyes are the only team on this list without a single win against a ranked opponent (not one!). Pending this weekend’s result the one time Iowa did face a team in the top 25 resulted in a 31-0 loss to then-No. 7 Penn State. On top of that Iowa’s offense ranks 13th in the conference at 18 points per game and dead last in yards per game thanks to a passing attack that threw for the same amount of touchdowns and interceptions (nine) averaging just 123.4 yards per game and 5.1 yards per attempt. All this to say despite some great defense and exceptional punting Iowa’s chances to upset Michigan look pretty slim. 8. 2021 Iowa Hawkeyes (10-4 7-2) Yes I have ranked the three most recent conference champions as the three lowest on this list. By ranking this Iowa team is responsible for the single best win of any team on the list with the upset of No. 4 Penn State in the middle of the season. Iowa also picked up rock-solid resume-boosters with early-season victories against No. 17 Indiana and No. 9 Iowa State. So once again why is Iowa so low? My sincere opinion is this Iowa team was a little overrated all along. After upsetting the Nittany Lions the Hawkeyes moved all the way up to land as the No. 2 team in the country. Immediately after the team lost two consecutive games to unranked Purdue and Wisconsin by a combined 37 points. Late in the season Iowa was blown out 42-3 in the Big Ten Championship before losing its bowl game to Kentucky  Just like the 2023 team Iowa’s offense struggled finishing 13th in the conference in yards per game except the defense was not as dominant on a play-to-play basis finishing closer to the middle of the pack. Where the defense did excel however was in the interception department in which the team snagged 25 picks in 14 games including three that were returned for touchdowns. Despite this no Big Ten team picked up less first downs than the Hawkeyes as the offense converted third and fourth downs around just one-third of the time. 7. 2018 Northwestern Wildcats (9-5 8-1) Despite going winless in the regular season non-conference slate including a pretty embarrassing home loss to Akron this Northwestern team turned it on when the lights were bright in conference play with the only loss being a three-point defeat to a ranked Michigan squad. Clayton Thorson and Paddy Fisher were the faces of the team that punched Northwestern’s first ticket to Indianapolis eventually culminating in a Holiday Bowl victory over Utah and a No. 21 ranking to close the year.  Although none were in the top 15 this Northwestern group has more ranked wins (four) than any other Big Ten West champion with victories coming against Michigan State Wisconsin Iowa and Utah. Those wins are enough to counteract a statistical resume that doesn’t do much to warrant confidence. Northwestern gets the edge over 2021 Iowa because of a bowl game victory and a far more competitive showing in the conference championship game which stood at 31-24 early in the fourth quarter in a battle with a potent Ohio State squad.  6. 2020 Northwestern Wildcats (7-2 6-1) The 2020 Wildcats are difficult to evaluate because of the pandemic-shortened season but much like the NBA bubble Lakers I don’t view the Wildcats’ success as a Mickey Mouse run. Instead I view the winning as even more impressive considering the circumstances. With canceled non-conference games against Tulane Central Michigan and Morgan State it’s not unrealistic to say this could have been a 10-2 Northwestern team. After a win against No. 10 Wisconsin Northwestern moved as high as No. 8 in the CFP rankings and after a win over Auburn in the Citrus Bowl the Wildcats finished the season 10th in the AP. Despite future first-round pick Rashawn Slater opting out of the season Northwestern was one of the most dangerous squads in the nation. The team was led by a defense that allowed a conference-low 15.9 points per game highlighted by a secondary group that included Greg Newsome II and Brandon Joseph who recorded this unreal play in the conference championship game against Ohio State — the closest margin in a Big Ten championship in the last six years: 5. 2014 Wisconsin Badgers (11-3 7-1) I found 2014 Wisconsin to be the single-hardest team to rank. On one hand the Badgers lost 59-0 in the Big Ten Championship to Ohio State (not great!). On the other Melvin Gordon (very great!). Ultimately I settled for smack dab in the middle. Wisconsin finished the year with three quality ranked wins (Nebraska Minnesota Auburn) an excellent record in conference play and a No. 13 ranking from the Associated Press. But what really puts this team in contention is its star running back. I’m just going to go ahead and list some cool things Melvin Gordon accomplished in 2014: I think you all get the point. 4. 2019 Wisconsin Badgers (10-4 7-2) The 2019 Badgers started the year 6-0 including a win against No. 11 Michigan and a 3-0 record in non-conference play in which the Badgers outscored their three opponents 158-0. Ranked as high as sixth in the country the Badgers fell back to earth with losses to Illinois and Ohio State. After going on another four-game win streak with wins over No. 18 Iowa and No. 8 Minnesota Wisconsin assumed the No. 8 spot in the ranking before another loss to a top-ranked Buckeye squad in Indianapolis. The season closed with an exhilarating Rose Bowl loss in a one-point game to the Justin Herbert-captained Oregon Ducks. So why then is this team with more losses than the ‘14 Badgers and without Melvin Gordon one spot higher in the ranking? The ranked wins are certainly a plus and the Badgers ranked in the top three among the Big Ten in both scoring offense and defense sitting atop the conference in yardage on both sides of the football. And despite no Melvin Gordon the Wisconsin running back factory churned out Jonathan Taylor who put together his own Doak Walker Award-winning season (for the second time) collecting unanimous All-American honors after a season in which he collected over 2000 rushing yards and 26 total touchdowns. 3. 2015 Iowa Hawkeyes (12-2 8-0) Iowa’s first unbeaten regular season since 1922 gets the Hawkeyes the bronze medal on this list. Although Iowa lacks any true signature wins (two victories over ranked opponents: No. 19 Wisconsin and No. 20 Northwestern) the overall body of work is impressive and no team has come closer to winning the Big Ten. Iowa fell to No. 5 Michigan State 16-13 on a nine-minute Spartan touchdown drive that left Iowa with just 27 seconds to mount a comeback. The season ended unceremoniously with Christian McCaffrey running up and down Iowa’s defense in the Rose Bowl as the Hawkeyes fell 45-16. Unlike the Hawkeye teams of late this Iowa offense scored almost 31 points a game with C.J. Beathard manning the offense. And shocker the defense still remained a top five unit in the Big Ten. The unit picked off a conference-best 19 passes returning four for scores. In my opinion the 2015 version is the clear choice amongst the three West-champion Hawkeye teams. 2. 2016 Wisconsin Badgers (11-3 7-2) This Badger team might have the strongest overall resume of any team on the list. The squad has four wins against teams in the top 12 (No. 5 LSU No. 8 Michigan State No. 7 Nebraska and No. 12 Western Michigan) and each of the three losses were in one-score games against top-10 teams. Seven-point losses to No. 4 Michigan No. 8 Penn State and No. 2 Ohio State (OT) make it easy to imagine a very different season where just one of those results is flipped which would make this team a prime candidate for the top spot. The Cotton Bowl champs outscored their opponents by 13 points per game averaging over 200 rushing yards per contest and holding their opponents under the 100-yard mark. Across 14 first quarters the Badgers defense led by T.J. Watt allowed just 22 points in total. Although the offense may have lacked the star power compared to other Wisconsin teams this may be the most well-rounded team the Badgers have fielded. 1. 2017 Wisconsin Badgers (13-1 9-0) A year after the impressive 2016 season the Badgers came back even better now armed with star freshman running back Jonathan Taylor. The team went undefeated in the regular season including wins over No. 20 Iowa and No. 24 Michigan. And most of Wisconsin’s games weren’t even close. In the regular season the team played in a singular one-score game an eight-point win over Purdue. Ranked fourth with a chance to clinch a spot in the College Football Playoff the Badgers could not defeat the Buckeyes for the second consecutive season losing 27-21 and falling instead to the Orange Bowl where they took care of business against a plucky Miami (FL) team ranked No. 10. Jonathan Taylor was the star breaking the record for most times being named Big Ten Freshman of the Week (eight) and finishing sixth in Heisman voting during his freshman year. Wisconsin outscored opponents by nearly 20 points per game (33.6 to 13.9) while once again rushing for over 200 yards per game and holding the opposition below the century-mark. The team converted an absurd 48% of its third downs and this time it was the fourth quarter defense that was superb allowing only 27 points over 14 fourth quarters. The team ranked seventh in the country by the end of the season is the clear candidate for the top spot on this list. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story The Wildcats wish they had a breakfast ball. After dropping both games in Las Vegas Northwestern (3-4 0-0 B1G) fell to Loyola University Chicago 73-68 on Wednesday morning. The Ramblers led for all 40 minutes in the game despite multiple runs by the ‘Cats to make the game tight. For Loyola Sam Galanopoulos and Alyssa Fisher led the way with 20 and 19 points respectively. Galanopoulos shot 7-of-14 from the field with three three-pointers and nine assists and Fisher went 6-of-10. Casey Harter and Hailey Weaver generated most of Northwestern’s offensive output. Weaver led the ‘Cats with 20 points on 6-of-12 shooting contributing six rebounds five assists two blocks and two steals. Harter didn’t miss from the field making all six of her field goal attempts to score 14 points. Paige Mott also added 12 points going 2-of-7 from the field and 8-of-9 at the free throw line. The Ramblers controlled the tip and Ali Berg drove right into the lane for an easy bucket but Caileigh Walsh responded with a tough finish on the ‘Cats first possession. However NU went cold after its initial bucket going over two minutes without a basket while Loyola took an 8-4 lead. The Ramblers added on to their advantage pushing it to 12-6 midway through the first quarter. Out of the break Sam Galanopoulos did it all on her own going on a 5-0 run and creating a double-digit lead for LUC. The ‘Cats did not score for four straight minutes until Casey Harter connected from the foul line; however by that point it was 21-8 Loyola. NU made it a little closer but the Ramblers comfortably led 21-10 after the first quarter. To start the second quarter NU looked to shrink Loyola’s lead but the Ramblers’ 7-2 run extended Northwestern’s deficit to 28-13 and forced Joe McKeown to burn a timeout with 6:49 in the half. After the timeout Harter drilled a three and Walsh followed it up with a triple of her own to cut NU’s deficit to single digits. However it was short-lived as LUC responded with a three of its own. Both teams traded buckets as the quarter drew to a close but the Ramblers held on to a 38-25 lead at the end of the first half. Out of the locker room Walsh laid it in to open up the scoring. On the other end of the floor sloppy play from both sides led to LUC calling a full timeout with barely a minute played in the third quarter. Harter hit her second three of the game bring the Wildcats within eight. The Ramblers brought the lead back to 12 and every time Harter made something happen for NU Loyola answered right back. Yet back-to-back threes from the ‘Cats cut Loyola’s lead to 48-40 with 3:45 left in the third quarter.  Out of the media timeout Weaver cashed another three from the corner and Mott split a pair from the charity stripe to make it a four-point game. On the ‘Cats’ next trip down the floor Alana Goodchild knocked a three down from dead center capping off a 13-0 NU run and bringing the score to 48-47 LUC. Despite the positive stretch for the Wildcats Melannie Daley picked up three fouls in a matter of minutes after checking into the game sending her right back to the bench with four fouls. The Ramblers seized momentum after the fouls closing the quarter on a 4-0 run and clinging to a 52-47 lead entering the final frame. Loyola got on the board first in the fourth quarter but an and-one by Mott kept the ‘Cats in striking distance. Off the next Ramblers miss Harter went coast-to-coast for a layup to make it a one-score game. However a bad turnover from Walsh gave the Ramblers a fast break and they tacked a point on at the charity stripe. As much as the ‘Cats tried to mount a comeback LUC always seemed to answer expanding its lead to seven with 4:50 left to play. Out of the media break Mott connected on a pair from the free-throw line and Weaver split a pair to make it a four-point game. The Ramblers pushed it back to six with a midrange jumper yet Weaver sank both free throws to make it a four-point game again.  After the Wildcats forced a turnover Mott bodied her way inside for a layup and Loyola called a timeout as it clung to a 64-62 lead with 92 seconds left in the game. However an and-one for the Ramblers looked like it put the game away but a four-point play from Weaver made it a two-point game with 17 seconds to go. However Loyola made both free throws to make it a two-possession game with 12 seconds remaining and Walsh’s layup attempt clanked out allowing LUC to hold on to a 73-68 victory. Up next for Northwestern is a matchup with Georgetown (5-1 0-0 Big East) at Welsh-Ryan Arena on Sunday afternoon.

Share this story We may have reached the end of the regular season and the end of the Big Ten in its current form but what a way to go out! Rivalry week in the conference featured multiple one-possession games and two teams shutting the door on their rivals’ hopes of making bowl games. The status quo held firm this week with no new teams reaching the six-win mark in this week’s action. However despite finishing the season with a loss to Wisconsin and a 5-7 record Minnesota will be going bowling as a result of having the highest Academic Progress Rate (APR) score out of the 5-7 teams who were vying for the final remaining spot in a postseason game. But while the Golden Gophers’ excellence in the classroom extended their season the eyes of Big Ten fans (and most college football fanatics) were fixated on Ann Arbor where then-No. 2 Ohio State and then-No. 3 Michigan faced off in what felt like a de facto CFP quarterfinal. 1. Michigan (12-0 9-0 B1G) Last Ranking: 1 Last Result: 30-24 win versus Ohio State Next: vs. Iowa Michigan was actually outgained 378 to 338 in total yards by No. 2 Ohio State but the Wolverines went 3-for-3 on 4th down and they won the turnover battle via two Kyle McCord interceptions. The first interception led to a seven-yard touchdown drive to give Michigan a 7-0 lead. The second pick ended then-No. 2 Ohio State’s potential game-winning drive. On the season Michigan is now 5-0 with Jim Harbaugh on the sidelines and 7-0 without him coaching on gameday. Harbaugh will return to the sidelines for the Big Ten Championship Game and if the Wolverines defeat No. 16 Iowa on Saturday it would make for one extremely awkward trophy handoff between Harbaugh and Big Ten Commissioner Tony Petitti. 2. Ohio State (11-1 8-1 B1G) Last Ranking: 2 Last Result: 30-24 loss at Michigan Next: Preying on the downfall of Florida State Texas and Alabama over the weekend. Ryan Day repeatedly stressed winning in two areas: the turnover battle and the rushing battle. The Buckeyes lost the turnover battle 2-0 and lost the rushing battle 156-107. Ohio State did overcome the initial turnover and despite being in a 14-3 hole the Buckeyes erased that deficit to tie the game at 17. For the first time since Michigan’s 35-21 win in 2003 Ohio State never led in The Game. The Buckeyes didn’t give up big-play touchdowns on the ground this year but Ohio State did end up allowing Michigan to play at its preferred pace as both teams only had four drives each (excluding the kneel down) in the second half. Michigan scored on all four of those.  The Buckeyes who slid to No. 6 in the latest CFP rankings will now hope to sneak into the CFP — like they did in 2022 — behind multiple big upsets (and a Georgia win) in other conference championship games. 3. Penn State (10-2 7-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 3 Last Result: 42-0 win at Michigan State Next: a New Year’s Six Bowl (most likely the Peach Bowl) Penn State rebounded from their loss to Michigan with two strong performances to end the season against Rutgers and Michigan State. The Nittany Lions outscored their final two opponents by a combined score of 69-6 including a 42-0 victory against the Spartans to close out the regular season.  Penn State was firing on all cylinders as Drew Allar totaled 292 passing yards and two touchdowns and the Nittany Lions tallied 283 rushing yards on 39 carries. Penn State did all that offensively while holding Michigan State to just 53 total yards behind seven sacks and 12 TFLs. 4. Iowa (10-2 7-2 B1G) Last Ranking: 4 Last Result: 13-10 win at Nebraska Next: vs. Michigan Many said ‘they can’t keep getting away with it.’ Well they did. Another low-scoring close victory has the No. 16 Hawkeyes on the second-longest winning streak in the conference (only behind undefeated Michigan) at the end of the regular season. Against Nebraska Iowa intercepted a pass with 15 seconds left and turned it into a walk-off 38-yard field goal to defeat the Cornhuskers 13-10 denying its opponent bowl eligibility in the process. The Big Ten West might be going away but Iowa winning low-scoring games remains a universal constant. Iowa only surpassed 15 points once in its final six games of the season but the Hawkeyes still went 5-1 in those games and will hope to spoil Michigan’s season with an upset in the Big Ten Championship Game. 5. Maryland (7-5 4-5 B1G) Last Ranking: 5 Last Result: 42-24 win at Rutgers Next: Maybe the Music City Bowl  Maryland lost four games in a row in the middle of the season but the Terrapins ended the season on a high note. Taulia Tagovailoa threw for 361 yards and three touchdowns against Rutgers and he also became the Big Ten’s all-time passing leader on Saturday. Maryland’s offense was extremely effective and the Terrapins jumped out to a 28-3 lead over the Scarlet Knights after they scored on each of their first four possessions. This game was the first time in a while that Maryland looked like the team that started the season 5-0. Now the Terps have some momentum going heading into their bowl game. 6. Northwestern (7-5 5-4 B1G) Last Ranking: 7 Last Result: 45-43 win at Illinois Next: Potentially the Guaranteed Rate Bowl Northwestern trailed Illinois 20-14 before a 75-yard touchdown drive in the final minute of the first half. Then Illinois clawed back a 31-28 lead after a touchdown at the beginning of the fourth quarter. But Northwestern was resilient and found a way to win — as it has all season long. A muffed punt led to a Northwestern touchdown and on the ensuing kickoff Northwestern forced a fumble and took that to the house as well to take a 42-31 lead. Illinois scored on an 80-yard passing touchdown but with overtime on the line Northwestern’s defense held strong and stopped Illinois’ two-point conversion that would have tied the game with under a minute left. The ‘Cats defied all odds this season going from 1-11 to being bowl eligible. A high-scoring win to secure the HAT was the cherry on top of an amazing season for the Wildcats. 7. Wisconsin (7-5 5-4 B1G) Last Ranking: 8 Last Result: 28-14 win at Minnesota Next: Possibly the Las Vegas Bowl Injuries derailed Wisconsin’s season but the Badgers ended the year strong after the returns of both Tanner Mordecai and Braelon Allen. Allen averaged 6.3 yards per carry en route to a 165-yard two-touchdown performance against Minnesota. Mordecai totaled 214 combined yards with two touchdowns of his own which was enough to lead the Badgers to a victory. A 7-5 record is not the desired outcome for a Wisconsin program that had 8+ wins every season from 2009 through 2019. However Fickell went 4-8 in his first season at Cincinnati in 2017 before going 44-7 across his next four seasons. Wisconsin fans should continue to feel hopeful for the future especially if the Badgers can stay healthier next season. 8. Rutgers (6-6 3-6 B1G) Last Ranking: 6 Last Result: 42-24 loss versus Maryland Next: Probably the Pinstripe Bowl Rutgers had relied on its defense all season to keep them in games and in some circumstances to win them games as well. Against Maryland their defense did not hold up its end of the bargain and before Rutgers could really get into a flow offensively the Scarlet Knights trailed 28-3. This offense is not good enough to make those types of comebacks but Rutgers fans should still take great pride in their program’s first six-win season since the team’s first year in the Big Ten. Even though Rutgers lost its last four games of the regular season this season proved that Greg Schiano is capable of restoring Rutgers to its late-2000s form — when Schiano himself led the Scarlet Knights to five straight seasons with seven or more wins. 9. Illinois (5-7 3-6 B1G) Last Ranking: 9 Last Result: 45-43 loss versus Northwestern Next: Overhauling a defense losing two NFL-ready linemen Illinois lost to Iowa by just two points but with Northwestern coming into town the Fighting Illini expected a bounce-back win to secure bowl eligibility. Things didn’t quite work out that way as Northwestern capitalized on two costly Illinois fumbles. Despite a late comeback attempt Illinois once again came up two points short of a victory. Illinois was expected to take a step back after losing its top three defensive backs — Devon Witherspoon Jartavius Martin and Sydney Brown — to the NFL along with starting quarterback Tommy Devito and running back Chase Brown. After 2023 the program will be losing two NFL-ready defenders (Jer’Zhan Newton and Keith Randolph Jr.) and Illinois must figure out how to replace them if it wants to get back to its impressive 2022 form. 10. Nebraska (5-7 3-6 B1G) Last Ranking: 10 Last Result: 13-10 loss versus Iowa Next: Asking the 2016 Chicago Cubs for advice on how to reverse a curse Nebraska intercepted a Deacon Hill pass in a 10-10 game with only 31 seconds left and it ended up with the ball on its own 45-yard-line after a penalty on the return. The Cornhuskers had a chance to move into field goal range and defeat then-No. 17 Iowa at home with bowl eligibility on the line or take the game to overtime without a score. Alas an interception by Chubba Purdy proved costly as Iowa cashed in on Purdy’s mistake and kicked the walk-off field goal to squeak past the Cornhuskers. After recording consecutive victories over Illinois Northwestern and Purdue Nebraska held a 5-3 record and looked poised to snap its six-year bowl game drought. But the wheels fell off for the Cornhuskers after the middle portion of the season. Four consecutive one-possession losses later (Michigan State Maryland Wisconsin and Iowa) and Nebraska finds itself short of the six-win mark once again. 11. Minnesota (5-7 3-6 B1G) Last Ranking: 11 Last Result: 28-14 loss versus Wisconsin Next: [Insert your favorite synonym for ‘maybe’] Quick Lane Bowl  Minnesota had a weekend filled with a lot of bad news but then some good news at the end. The Golden Gophers scored a touchdown on their opening drive to take a 7-0 lead over Wisconsin and the game ended up tied at 14 heading into halftime. Minnesota probably felt good about that result but then Wisconsin erupted for 14 points in the third quarter to take a 28-14 lead and the Badgers never looked back from there. Minnesota was shut out in the second half and it suffered the loss to its rival as a result. So what was the good news after the Golden Gophers lost four consecutive games to end the season? Well there was one spot left in bowl games for teams who were not automatically eligible. Minnesota’s APR was the highest among 5-7 teams meaning that despite failing to reach six wins the Golden Gophers will be bowling for the third year in a row. Considering P.J. Fleck is 4-0 in bowl games at Minnesota the Golden Gophers have a good chance of cashing in on a second chance at ending the season on a high note. 12. Purdue (4-8 3-6 B1G) Last Ranking: 14 Last Result: 35-31 win versus Indiana Next: Searching for the next Charlie Jones (or David Bell or Rondale Moore) After being sidelined with an injury during the Boilermakers’ loss to Northwestern Hudson Card returned with a vengeance against Indiana. The former Texas quarterback threw for 275 yards and three touchdowns and he added 85 yards and another touchdown on the ground to lead Purdue to a 35-31 win over Indiana. The Boilermakers started 1-2 after non-conference losses to Fresno State and Syracuse and looked like an early candidate to end the season last in the conference. In its first year under Ryan Walters Purdue went 3-6 in conference and ended up tied for 4th in the B1G West. Considering all the talent that left Purdue after the 2022 season (on both the roster and the coaching staff) this season could have gone a lot worse but the Boilermakers still have a lot to figure out to improve before the 2024 campaign. 13. Michigan State (4-8 2-7 B1G) Last Ranking: 12 Last Result: 42-0 loss versus Penn State Next: Recruiting Jonathan Smith’s former Oregon State players to join him in East Lansing For the third time this season Michigan State proved unable to even compete against the top of the conference. The Spartans were outscored 129-3 by Michigan Ohio State and Penn State over the course of the year. The 42-0 loss to then-No. 11 Penn State over the weekend ensured that the Spartans would be looking outside of East Lansing to find the program’s next head coach.  Michigan State looked to the Pacific Northwest and gave the job to Jonathan Smith — the former head coach at Oregon State. At OSU Smith took over a program that went 1-11 the season before he took over. After a bumpy start to his tenure in Corvallis Smith boasted a 25-10 record in his last three seasons including three straight appearances in bowl games (including this season). Smith now hopes to engineer a turnaround at Michigan State similar to the one he pulled off with the Beavers. 14. Indiana (3-9 1-8 B1G) Last Ranking: 13 Last Result: 35-31 loss at Purdue Next: Getting in line for the wild ride that we call the coaching carousel  After defeating Wisconsin 20-14 it looked like Indiana could end the season with some momentum against a weaker schedule. Unfortunately for Hoosiers fans despite averaging 32.3 points over its final three games Indiana did not pick up a single victory and ended the season with seven losses in its final eight games. There were little flashes of improvement throughout the year for the Hoosiers especially on the offensive end but nothing ever materialized in terms of victories. After ending the season 3-9 the Hoosiers made the decision to fire Tom Allen who had been Indiana’s head coach since 2017 and ended his stint at Indiana with a 33-49 record.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The captain made the media’s Third Team in 2022 and finished third in the conference with 110 total tackles. He also tacked on four tackles for loss an interception two forced fumbles and a sack while playing a team-high 801 snaps. The ‘Cats’ two starting inside linebackers were both voted on to the prestigious teams with Xander Mueller slotting into the media’s All-Big Ten Third Team. Mueller posted a team-high 10.5 tackles for loss and three interceptions plus accrued 102 tackles five sacks and two pass deflections. Additionally guard Josh Priebe was named to the All-Big Ten Third Team. The senior captain allowed 17 pressures and had a 97.5 PFF efficiency the best among any NU O-lineman. Wildcats that received honorable mentions included kicker Jack Olsen (coaches/media) cornerback Rod Heard II (coaches/media) receiver A.J. Henning (coaches/media) receiver Bryce Kirtz (media) defensive lineman Aidan Hubbard (media) and safety Coco Azema (media). NU sixth-year wideout Cam Johnson ranked seventh in the Big Ten in both catches (50) and yards (684) but was not included among the honorees.

We had the perfect storybook ending to the regular season that all Northwestern fans were hoping for.  May I take your hat sir?   pic.twitter.com/tyB3txWHhZ In a back-and-forth edge-of-your-seat type of game — the antithesis of your typical Big Ten West contest — Ben Bryant had one his best outings of the season. He put up 234 yards with two passing touchdowns (and even a rushing score to spice things up). A special teams masterclass saw a fumble recovery for a touchdown by Garner Wallace and defensively the ‘Cats were able to prevent Illinois from leading for nearly 60 minutes.  All season a common theme for NU has been struggling to stop the run game. It seems like it finally came together for Northwestern on Saturday holding the Fighting Illini to an average of only 3.3 yards per rush. That’s a vast improvement over the 5.6-yard average that Purdue had on the Wildcats the game prior — and it’s one of the lowest opponent rushing averages of the season. Yep it didn’t seem like life could get any better than that. That is until yesterday.  Enter David Braun: your Big Ten Coach of the Year (that was unanimous by the way) and the program’s most successful rookie head coach in the last century. No other conference coach is more deserving. Now I’ve been pushing the Braun agenda since the Penn State game; yes I know what the score was. Yes I did receive a lot of flak by insisting on his full-time title so early. In fact I was pretty much on board after the Minnesota game. Why? Because it was clear to me that there had been a significant change in morale. A team that had four wins across two years believed enough in themselves to come back 21 points and bring an almost un-winnable game to overtime. The fans might not have had faith that day but the players did — and their coach had their back. Hindsight makes this clearer than ever. But I digress. I cannot emphasize enough how much I think David Braun is the best fit for this program. In a season where no one really predicted more than two wins (I was told I was crazy for predicting four) he helped this team produce seven.  When Braun was first promoted to interim head coach he declared at one of his initial pressers that his goal for the team would be for them “to win the Big Ten West championship show back up in Indy and go win a bowl game.” The first time I read that I laughed out loud.  Look at how close Braun came to doing just that. From leading a team that was in shambles this summer to a bowl game he defied all odds.  In about a month or so we’ll have one more chance to see this underdog team in the postseason; although we don’t know which one is it quite yet or who it’ll be against I can’t wait to see the bowl’s name with inscribed onto the walls of the new Ryan Field. Every time I see it I’ll be reminded of how special it was to be a small part of such a spectacular season. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Things aren’t great. Sitting at 3-4 Northwestern women’s basketball has lost its last three games in a row. At the Ball Dawgs Classic in Las Vegas the ‘Cats fell to No. 13 Florida State 90-52 before losing to Belmont in the consolation game by 22 points. A few days later the Wildcats lost to Loyola-Chicago 73-68 at Welsh-Ryan Arena for the first time in 26 games against the Ramblers to extend the losing streak. Here’s three takeaways from that stretch: Northwestern needs to start faster to give itself a fighting chance It’s something head coach Joe McKeown immediately pointed out in his presser following NU’s loss to Loyola-Chicago when he called his team’s play “unacceptable” in a first quarter where the Ramblers led 21-10. In their past three games the ‘Cats have been outscored in the first quarter by a combined mark of 71-35. Extending that to the beginning of the season Northwestern has been outscored by double-digits in the first or second quarter in every game but one: its win over Omaha.  It hasn’t always been because of shooting struggles or even the turnovers: it’s often been due to defensive issues. In each of those three first quarters the ‘Cats surrendered more than 20 points. Defensive breakdowns — particularly on the perimeter when it came to closing out on shots — constantly put Northwestern behind the eight ball early in games. Casey Harter is improving rapidly but Northwestern needs more out of Caroline Lau From the team’s scrimmage on Nov. 2 onward it’s been clear that Casey Harter would earn significant minutes off the bench. For a true first-year that’s impressive by itself. Yet the Philadelphia native has gone even further as she’s seized the sixth-woman spot with her perimeter shooting and then some. In her first four games Harter only broke the 10-minute threshold twice and went scoreless in three of those contests. However against FSU Belmont and Loyola she’s played 25 29 and 35 minutes respectively. She broke her career-high of six points against Notre Dame in each of these last three games and punctuated that run with a 14-point game versus the Ramblers on a 6-of-7 shooting clip. While Northwestern has struggled with turnovers Harter hasn’t; she has just two turnovers combined in the last three games despite taking on point guard duties for long stretches. On Wednesday after the Loyola loss McKeown complimented the first-year’s versatility and decision-making. On the other hand Caroline Lau has struggled with ball security and foul trouble since Northwestern went to Las Vegas. Against the Seminoles she turned the ball over eight times while shooting 1-of-7 from the field. It didn’t get much better against Belmont when Lau only played 11 minutes. The sophomore committed two fouls and two turnovers without scoring a point or picking up an assist and Harter took most of the point guard minutes throughout the middle of the game. Lau rebounded against Loyola and stuffed the stat sheet but still only played 22 minutes in a game that went down to the wire. It’s worth noting that some of these struggles could be somewhat out of Lau’s control — she has worn a mask on the court for at least the last two weeks and could be playing through an injury. Still though Northwestern needs more at the guard spot to win Big Ten games let alone the non-conference ones that should be much easier. Given how vital Lau is to Northwestern’s future it’s incredibly hard to imagine Harter supplanting her as the starter. If Harter continues to improve the way she has in the last three games though McKeown will have to find some way to up her minute total. With a month left until NU enters the crux of the Big Ten slate it should be interesting to see how both players will develop. This could be the lowest point of the Joe McKeown Era or close to it Entering Wednesday Northwestern was 25-0 all-time against Loyola. Last year the Ramblers went 6-24 lost their last 16 games in a row and were the worst team in the Atlantic 10. In their opener on Nov. 6 they lost by 16 points at home to UIC a team that NU beat three days later. Not only did Loyola come into Welsh-Ryan Arena and win it never trailed. After the ‘Cats tied the score at two points the Ramblers broke the tie and led the rest of the way. It marked Northwestern’s fourth loss in November. The Wildcats haven’t lost four games before Dec. 1 since 2008-09 which happened to be McKeown’s first season at the helm. He inherited a team that had gone 5-26 overall in the year prior and 1-17 in Big Ten play. This team is much more talented. Three of its starters are top-100 recruits according to ESPN. Northwestern returned three of its five starters from last year and that’s not even including Melannie Daley and Hailey Weaver. Losing a great defender like Sydney Wood hurts but returning that many key players should have alleviated the issue. Instead Northwestern’s defensive rating stood at 111.1 points per 100 possessions heading into the Loyola game which sits at Division I’s fourth percentile.  This is the stage of the season where many expected growth from a young team to manifest itself but that just hasn’t happened. With the competition only getting stiffer it’s fair to wonder if it will. Northwestern has Georgetown Maryland and a DePaul team that just beat Loyola by 21 last Sunday up next. There’s a very real chance the ‘Cats start 3-7 and a six-game losing streak before the new year arrives is a recipe for disaster. Ultimately Northwestern has to get in the win column soon or at least show substantial improvement on the defensive end. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story I wrote this story 292 days ago.  It focused on processing emotions. In trying to process something as monumental as this — Northwestern men’s basketball knocking off No. 1 Purdue at Welsh-Ryan Arena for the second time in a calendar year — you start there. You start with the similarities to grasp the reality that lightning did strike twice. You witnessed the return of the Gothic uniforms. You saw a packed sold-out student section clad in black.  You watched a first half where Purdue immediately gained control on the offensive end by playing through Zach Edey who found knockdown three-point shooters out of the post at will and dictated defenders like he had them on a yo-yo. You shook your head at how NU built its slow-paced offense littered with highly-contested shots on a house of cards that somehow wouldn’t blow over. You knew that Northwestern was always down in those 20 minutes but somehow never out. You remembered those feelings. You admired Boo Buie’s steady scoring and his bottomless bag of poetic responses. Your emotions heated up as the Boilermakers cooled down from deep and the aggressive Northwestern defense began to burn the floor purple. You watched that persistent second-half push and an iconic three-point play to seize the lead and the crowd. You remembered those feelings. You beamed as a star guard made a trademark play that looked like it clinched the game in the closing minutes and then... Let’s stop there.  I actually didn’t watch that Buie floater with 3.9 seconds left in regulation go down.  When it became clear that Northwestern had a chance to win the game on its final possession with about 40 seconds to go in regulation David Gold Bradley Locker and I leapt out of our seats in the press row on the top floor and sprinted to the court level. Weirdly enough we had actually planned for this in advance. Seeing what had happened in February and knowing what was potentially in store we wanted to get the best and closest shot of a court-storming video possible if the situation called for it. Even just 12 hours later those few minutes still feel like a blur. I ran past the Purdue locker room and got blocked by three security guards who might have thought I was trying to storm the court (and understandably so). I saw Buie’s shot graze the bottom of the net and heard Welsh-Ryan Arena hit a crescendo only matched by No. 0’s and-one that gave the ‘Cats a 48-47 lead. A couple of seconds later we reunited on the sideline near half-court and knelt so the Purdue fans behind us could watch. As chaotic as the scene around me felt like — I was trying to keep a live feed going on our Twitter confirm our plan and learn why the student section erupted in a roar — there was a part of me that felt as in control there as I had all night. We planned for the unthinkable. And for once that night and maybe in the last 10 months we were ready for it. Until we weren’t. Purdue completed the pass Edey finished the layup and we had overtime. We jogged back upstairs and quickly decided we were not doing that again. Just when the three of us thought we’d seen it all the game whipped out a 12-6 curveball with more break than Clayton Kershaw’s. And then if that wasn’t enough so did the Wildcats. The similarities of this game to that Feb. 12 clash serve as the foundation for wrapping your head around it but the differences are what make it special. The biggest one is that this win wasn’t a rock fight. Instead it was a slugfest.  At a media availability on Thursday afternoon Chris Collins said that Northwestern would likely need the score to fall in the low 60s to win this game. Of course that didn’t happen and Edey was just one foul away from wiping out NU’s entire frontcourt. His 35 points and 14 rebounds don’t fully capture the profoundness of his impact which Collins compared to Tim Duncan’s after the game. Unlike last season he also got help from his backcourt; Fletcher Loyer and Braden Smith combined for 29 points on 50% shooting and constantly beat defenders off the dribble in the early going. In the first 10 minutes almost everything defensively went wrong for the ‘Cats. They couldn’t cover ball screens and Smith was getting to the hoop at will. When Lance Jones hit a three-pointer to extend Purdue’s lead to 13 with 7:30 in the first half it seemed like the Boilermakers were about to end the game before it had really even started. As thrilling as the 2022-23 iteration of this game was Northwestern’s deficit never reached double digits. The PU fans in attendance roared as Collins called a timeout.  “We just talked about the game is a long game” Collins said after the game. “Hang in there. We’ve got to shut it off now. We can’t let them get away from us.” In the midst of some unfamiliarity they remembered those feelings. Northwestern’s responses began with how it chipped away at that early deficit and cut the lead to eight points at halftime which Collins took pride in. They wouldn’t stop and they came from nearly everyone. They came from Luke Hunger who in his de-facto Big Ten debut played the best game of his young career and sparked NU’s second-half run with his defense on Edey. They came from Ryan Langborg who began hitting tough shot after tough shot down the stretch just when it looked like his shooting slump would continue. They even came from Blake Preston who stuck his hand in the post to force the decisive turnover in overtime. They came from Ty Berry who rose up from start to finish and served as the consistent second perimeter option that Northwestern needed to win this game. And then there was Buie who might go down as the greatest player to ever don purple and white. Buie did more than just lead Northwestern on Friday night; he defined it. He didn’t get good looks late in the shot clock early on largely due to Purdue’s focus on smothering him off the ball. Yet he constantly made magic out of a sliver of space. Facing a deficit and taller defenders collapsing on him he just slithered into the lane and found ways to score when there seemed to be none. Northwestern is an under-recruited point guard like Buie. It was too small. It wasn’t supposed to win this game getting outrebounded 52-27 and committing 29 fouls. Every success story should be the exception. If it were to happen again it certainly wouldn’t come from players at the back of the rotation playing big minutes against the Wooden Award favorite. It’s tough to bet on a coach that most wanted fired at this point last year and a captain labeled as inefficient. They could have just been lucky. They remembered the feeling and wrote this story.          \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Ahead of tonight’s conference championship game between the Michigan Wolverines and Iowa Hawkeyes let’s go ahead and rank every edition of the Big Ten title game that’s been played in Indianapolis. Because this is the final season of the East-West divisional format for the purposes of this ranking we will only be counting the nine games played since this format was introduced. Although the Big Ten Championship began in 2011 this means that Michigan State-Wisconsin (2011) Nebraska-Wisconsin (2012) and Michigan State-Ohio State (2013) will be excluded from this ranking. Let’s dive right in. 9. Michigan 42 Iowa 3 (2021) Placing at the bottom of the rankings is the 2021 edition of the conference championship Michigan’s first-ever appearance in Indianapolis. After beating Ohio State for the first time in a decade it seemed like a formality that the No. 2 team in the nation would capture their first conference title since 2004. Michigan did just that jumping out to a quick score in the first quarter and never surrendering the lead. Iowa’s only points of the game came on a first-quarter field goal. Unsurprisingly the stats are lopsided in this one with Michigan out-gaining Iowa 461-279. The highlight of this one was a first quarter screen pass to running back Donovan Edwards who subsequently looked down field and hurled the ball to Roman Wilson for a 75-yard trick play touchdown. The MVP of the game was future Detroit Lion Aidan Hutchinson who is the  only defensive player to receive the award in the game’s history. Although this game was exhilarating if you’re a Michigan fan it was a snoozer for everyone else.  8. Michigan 43 Purdue 22 (2022) This game features the only time in Big Ten Championship history where one of the teams was unranked headed into Indianapolis. Against Michigan who was once again ranked No. 2 in the nation prognosticators did not give the Boilermakers much of a chance. Respect to Purdue who kept it close through two quarters heading into the locker room trailing 14-13; however things got out of hand in the second half as the Wolverines kept their undefeated record intact cruising to their second consecutive conference championship and another trip to the College Football Playoffs. Donovan Edwards ran all over Purdue’s defense in Blake Corum’s absence piling on 185 yards and a touchdown eventually earning MVP honors. This game could have been more competitive if not for a few poorly-timed Purdue interceptions and a handful of cowardly field goals. For an 8-4 team going against a well-oiled Michigan machine Purdue put forth an admirable effort but throughout this one it always felt like the better team would come out on top. 7. Ohio State 59 Wisconsin 0 (2014) In the first season of the College Football Playoffs and the Big Ten’s new division format the No. 5 Buckeyes and No. 13 Badgers faced off in one of the most stunning games in recent conference memory. After Ohio State’s starting quarterback J.T. Barrett suffered a season-ending ankle injury the prior week against Michigan the third-string redshirt sophomore Cardale Jones was thrust into the first start of his college career. Despite Ohio State’s 11-1 record this uncertainty at the quarterback position made Wisconsin a 4.5-point favorite.  ""Ohio State immediately set the tone of this one marking the only shutout in Big Ten Conference Championship history. The Buckeyes gained 558 yards to the Badgers 258 holding the Badgers’ ground attack led by the record-breaking Melvin Gordon to only 71 yards on the day. This game was loaded with NFL talent: including Joey Bosa Ezekiel Elliott Michael Thomas and Taylor Decker but it was the first-time starter in Jones who took home MVP honors throwing for 257 yards and three touchdowns. OSU coach Urban Meyer later admitted to running up the score to ensure his team would secure a spot in the four-team playoff."" So if this game was such a blowout why isn’t it last on the ranking? It’s actually pretty simple: this game was the start of one of the greatest underdog runs in college football history. Ranked No. 4 going into the playoffs Jones kept up his great play and helped the Buckeyes upset No. 1 Alabama 42-35. In the inaugural CFP national championship Ohio State defeated Oregon 42-20 to win the program’s eighth national title. 6. Ohio State 45 Northwestern 24 (2018) Northwestern’s first-ever trip to the Big Ten Championship resulted in a surprisingly entertaining game against the No. 6 ranked Buckeyes. This game featured a ton of offense as Ohio State set the Big Ten Championship record for passing yards (499) and first downs (31) on the back of Dwayne Haskins’ MVP-deserving day. Despite the dynamite offense from the East champs the plucky 8-4 Wildcats were able to keep up with the Buckeyes for a large part of the game even kicking a field goal to make the game 24-31 early in the fourth quarter. Ohio State pulled away in the fourth to cover the 16.5-point spread but it was a high-scoring and entertaining game with over 1000 total yards on offense that is far from the worst product the Big Ten had ever showcased in its title game. 5. Ohio State 22 Northwestern 10 (2020) Are you tired of reading about the Buckeyes in Big Ten title games? I’ve got bad news for you. After a tumultuous season of pandemic cancellations and wonky results the No. 4 Buckeyes (5-0) took on the No. 14 Wildcats (6-1) in the second meeting of these two teams in three years of championship games. Once again the Buckeyes were 16.5-point favorites and once again Northwestern kept it competitive this time even taking a 10-6 lead into the half. There’s no way to describe this game that does not start with Trey Sermon. Even on a down day for Justin Fields the Buckeyes running back went on a frenzy collecting a Big Ten Championship Game record 331 rushing yards (and the MVP award) in one of the most dominant displays of offensive line play I can remember. In a mostly empty Lucas Oil Stadium it wasn’t the prettiest contest — both quarterbacks threw two interceptions including a jaw-dropping end-zone snag by Brandon Joseph — but it was a competitive game that deserves a middle-tier spot in the rankings. 4. Ohio State 34 Wisconsin 21 (2019) On the fun scale this game grades out very well. No. 1 Ohio State and No. 8 Wisconsin met at the end of the 2019 season with high stakes on the line. The underdog Badgers jumped out to a 21-7 lead by halftime with the Buckeyes first points coming with just 0:42 remaining in the first half. It didn’t take long for the Buckeyes to fire up a comeback claiming a 24-21 lead late in the third quarter and extending it to two scores early in the fourth. Chase Young and Ohio State’s defense was marvelous in the second half but it was Justin Fields who won MVP with 299 yards and three scores. Although OSU would get knocked down to No. 2 in the rankings in favor of Joe Burrow and LSU this game had everything a football fan could ask for: comebacks one-handed catches fake punts and Wisconsin’s punter literally dropping the ball. 3. Ohio State 27 Wisconsin 21 (2017) Despite Wisconsin’s undefeated regular season and No. 4 ranking it was the No. 8 Buckeyes who were favored in yet another matchup between Ohio State and Wisconsin. Future NFL stars Denzel Ward and Terry McLauirn set the tone early with a stellar interception and subsequent long touchdown catch to put the scarlet and gray up seven. Yet Wisconsin responded with a pick-six on an errant decision from J.T. Barrett. When Ohio State’s offense wasn’t shooting itself in the foot with turnovers the Buckeyes led by MVP J.K. Dobbins clearly looked like the better team. But Ohio State kept putting the ball in harm’s way allowing Wisconsin to keep up with the Buckeyes and make the game 24-21 Ohio State early in the fourth. After a ten-minute delay to fix the end zone turf (viewers of Iowa-Northwestern at Wrigley Field in 2023 will be glad to know the Big Ten has been having grass-related delays for years!) Ohio State began to run the clock. Just six days after having surgery on his knee Barrett led a gutsy drive highlighted by a fourth-and-one conversion where the quarterback looked dead to rights but escaped. The Buckeyes kicked a field goal to extend the lead to six and an Alex Hornibrook interception ended Wisconsin’s perfect season. The next day somewhat surprisingly the Badgers found out they had been booted from the CFP for Alabama who would go on to win it all. 2. Penn State 38 Wisconsin 31 (2016) 10-2 Badgers. 10-2 Nittany Lions. College GameDay in the house. And boy did this game live up to the hype. Wisconsin’s first two drives each went the length of the field as the Badgers raced out to a 14-0 start later getting a scoop-and-score defensive score and another rushing touchdown to claim a 28-7 lead with five minutes remaining in the second quarter. But you all read the heading for this section you know what happens next. Penn State rattled off 21 unanswered points to tie the game before the third quarter had even expired. Big plays came from guys you would expect (Saquon Barkley Chris Godwin and Mike Gesicki) and ones you probably wouldn’t (Saeed Blacknall). Wisconsin tacked on a field goal to take a three-point lead into the final frame. Wisconsin’s defense could not stop Trace McSorley’s downfield shots as PSU claimed its first lead of the game on a Barkley receiving touchdown. On the decisive drive of the game Wisconsin worked into Nittany Lion territory and had a fourth-and-one from the 24 needing a touchdown to send the game to OT. Corey Clement was stuffed short of the line to gain and with just one minute left that all but sealed Penn State’s first Big Ten title. 1. Michigan State 16 Iowa 13 (2015) No. 5 Michigan State sitting at 11-1 against 12-0 Iowa ranked No. 4. The winner gets a trip to the CFP and a Big Ten championship. The loser gets nothing (except a New Year’s Six Bowl). This game was a defensive slugfest early on — certainly not as visually appealing as Penn State-Wisconsin but this Michigan State team (fresh off a walk-off field goal win over No. 2 Ohio State and the same season as the infamous “Trouble With the Snap” game against Michigan) had a knack for playing in close games. Connor Cook (MSU) and C.J. Beathard (Iowa) had been arguably the two best quarterbacks in the conference in 2015 but the defenses took center stage with Iowa taking a 6-3 halftime lead with only field goals on the board. The kicking continued in the third quarter with the Spartans adding another two boots to take a 9-6 lead. Early in the fourth the impossible happened — Beathard found Tevaun Smith deep down the field for an 85-yard score the game’s first touchdown giving the Hawkeyes a four-point lead that would require Michigan State to stop settling for field goals. After trading punts Michigan State went on the most iconic drive in Big Ten Championship Game history. 22 plays. 82 yards. Nine minutes and four seconds off the game clock and six first downs gained. The drive is just as stress-inducing to watch now as it was eight years ago. It’s classic ground-and-pound control-the-clock Big Ten football.

Share this story Defense and rebounding win games. Unfortunately Northwestern struggled mightily in both categories Sunday afternoon. The Wildcats (3-5 0-0 B1G) fell to visiting Georgetown (7-1 0-0 Big East) 82-58 in a game where the home squad led for just 16 seconds. The Hoyas utterly dominated Northwestern on the glass (especially in the first half) winning the rebound battle 35-25. That included 13 offensive rebounds which led to 13 second-chance points. Georgetown also got to the line far more often shooting 28 free throws compared to just 16 for Northwestern. The ‘Cats’ offense was led by Caroline Lau and Caileigh Walsh who scored 11 and 13 points respectively. Hailey Weaver also made a major two-way impact scoring seven points and adding three steals. No Wildcat garnered more than four rebounds. As for the visitors Kelsey Ransom and Victoria Rivera led the way. Ransom had 16 points and Rivera also added 16 12 of which came in the opening quarter. Graceann Bennett also had herself a day scoring 15 points and grabbing six rebounds. Brianna Scott was crucial for Georgetown off the bench chipping in 13 points and eight rebounds. In a surprising move coach Joe McKeown left Walsh on the bench to start in favor of sophomore forward Alana Goodchild. The Wildcats won the tip and just over a minute into the game Goodchild opened the scoring. The 6-foot-2-inch Australian making her first career start canned a midrange jumper from the left side to give the Wildcats a 2-0 lead.  However Georgetown would quickly respond. The visitors went on a 14-0 run over a three minute span that included four three-pointers from Rivera one of the starting guards. Her 12 points on 4-of-5 shooting helped the Hoyas build a 14-4 lead at the timeout midway through the first quarter. One of the reasons for the big lead was domination on the glass. Georgetown totaled five offensive rebounds in the first five minutes; Northwestern grabbed four total rebounds in that span. However the game would soon flip thanks to Lau. A three-minute field goal drought for Georgetown combined with consecutive threes from Lau cut the lead to six making it 18-11. The Hoyas were able to keep their cushion thanks to an abundance of free throws (8-of-10 in the opening frame) and through the first 10 minutes they held a 22-13 lead.  The Wildcats’ woes continued in the second quarter which Georgetown opened on a 7-0 run to stretch the lead to 16. Northwestern did claw back to within 13 thanks to a Maggie Pina three-pointer after multiple offensive rebounds but an and-one from Georgetown’s Ransom on Paige Mott (Mott’s third foul of the afternoon) stymied the momentum. Walsh tried to get the Wildcats back in the game with back-to-back buckets but the defense simply couldn’t get a stop or a rebound. With just over three minutes to play in the first half a Ransom jumper pushed the Georgetown lead to 18 the largest of the game at that point. The basket also came off an offensive rebound — Georgetown’s 12th of the game to that point. The fouling and rebounding issues continued to plague Northwestern as halftime approached. Through 20 minutes four Wildcats had multiple fouls and Georgetown was winning the rebounding battle 22-12. The ‘Cats also closed the first half by going nearly four and a half minutes without a field goal and the result was a 51-27 halftime deficit.  Ransom and Rivera led the way for the Hoyas combining for 29 points on 9-of-20 shooting. The 12 offensive rebounds for Georgetown led to 13 second chance points and the visitors were also 15-of-17 from the charity stripe in the first half. For Northwestern Walsh coming off the bench for just the 14th time in her 67-game career led the way with eight points. Lau chipped in six and Goodchild added four but the Wildcats were nonetheless in a massive hole with 20 minutes to play. Northwestern came out of the locker room hot dictating the pace of the game in a way it wasn’t able to in the first half. Through the first four minutes of the third quarter Georgetown totaled just four points. Unfortunately for the Wildcats they totaled just six points over that same timeframe. The offenses would quickly pick up after that combining for 12 points in the ensuing two minutes. With the game moving at a frenetic pace Northwestern was able to get plenty of scoring but getting stops proved far more difficult. Despite turning to a full-court press and outscoring the Hoyas 20-16 in the third quarter Northwestern still went into the final frame staring down a deficit of 67-47.  Thanks to the full-court press the ‘Cats continued to chip away at the massive lead. A pair of Georgetown turnovers and six combined points from Walsh and Lau cut the deficit to just 15. However Georgetown would soon snap its three-minute scoring drought and a 9-0 Hoya run pushed the lead all the way to 24 buoyed by a four-minute scoring drought on Northwestern’s part. The final three minutes of the game were marked by lots of misses and lots of near turnovers. Georgetown did a platoon swap to put its reserves in with 90 seconds to go and the Hoyas were easily able to ride out an 82-58 victory. Northwestern will be back in action on the road against Maryland at 12 p.m. central time next Sunday.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story On the heels of a rather remarkable 7-5 season and second-place Big Ten West finish Northwestern football is hot in the streets — and going somewhere warm as a top option for bowl game aggregators. On Sunday afternoon it was announced that NU will be taking on Utah in the 2023 SRS Distribution Las Vegas Bowl in Las Vegas Nevada. As for game specifics the contest will take place in Allegiant Stadium — home of the Las Vegas Raiders — Saturday Dec. 23 at 6:30 p.m. CT/4:30 p.m. PT. The Wildcats’ trip to the Silver State will mark their first bowl game since 2020 when they took down Auburn 35-19 in the Citrus Bowl. More specifically 2023 will be the program’s first ever bowl game played in Nevada and first game there since 2006 — when the ‘Cats lost to the Nevada Wolf Pack 31-21.  As for the team’s opponent the Utes (8-4 5-4 PAC-12) reached as high as No. 10 in the AP Poll but lost consecutive road matchups to No. 5 Washington and No. 19 Arizona in Weeks 11-12. Their strong season occurred despite star veteran QB Cam Rising missing all of the year due to torn ligaments in his knee suffered at the conclusion of the 2022 campaign — one which saw Utah win its second straight PAC-12 title. Now in his 19th season at the helm Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham has led his program to 15 bowl games. Last year the Utes lost the Rose Bowl to Penn State 35-21. In the all-time series history Northwestern is 2-1 against Utah. The two programs dueled in the 2018 Holiday Bowl in San Diego which saw NU prevail 31-20.

Share this story Week 13 was busy for the Northwestern alumni in the NFL. From fixtures like Rashawn Slater to new additions like Trevor Siemian let’s look at what the former ‘Cats accomplished in the pros. Rashawn Slater: Los Angeles Chargers OT Slater was rock-solid as usual in a messy 6-0 win against the Patriots in Foxboro. He played all 61 offensive snaps and kept Justin Herbert upright in the pocket. In fact the entire Chargers’ O-line shut down New England’s pass rush refusing to give up a single sack.  Though they escaped with a win the Chargers need to do some serious soul-searching to get their offense back on track. Los Angeles ran the ball 24 times for just 29 yards — Slater’s fellow linemen need to elevate their play to give Austin Ekeler and company some better lanes. At 5-7 Slater and the Chargers will continue to claw back to .500 at home against Russell Wilson and the Broncos. Week 14 matchup: vs. Denver Broncos (Sunday 3:25 p.m. CT) Greg Newsome II: Cleveland Browns CB Similar to last week Newsome had a lackluster performance in the Browns’ 36-19 loss to the Rams. Denzel Ward missed another week with his shoulder injury but Newsome moved back to his natural slot position on Sunday. Unfortunately for him the Rams have the best slot receiver in the league: Cooper Kupp. Newsome didn’t give up any chunk yardage as Kupp finished with six catches for 39 yards and a touchdown. Overall Newsome finished with three tackles two of them solo. He got burned by Puka Nacua in the third quarter; luckily for the Northwestern alum the ball slipped through Nacua’s fingers. Newsome also looked pretty languid on the run defense. For example he took a rough-looking route trying to pursue Kyren Williams to start the second half. The Browns may be at a disadvantage with the loss of Deshaun Watson but Newsome needs to improve his play if Cleveland’s defense wants to return to its early-season dominance. Week 14 matchup: vs. Jacksonville Jaguars (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Peter Skoronski: Tennessee Titans OG Skoronski showed off his run-blocking chops in Tennessee’s crushing 31-28 loss to the Colts in overtime. On the Titans’ first drive he and Jaelyn Duncan threw a killer double-team block to make space for Derrick Henry to cut to the left and score a 22-yard touchdown.  The rookie guard continues to improve after coming back from an appendectomy in Week Five. Unfortunately the rest of the Titans’ line hasn’t fared as well. The Colts were chasing Will Levis around all game long notching six sacks against the first-year quarterback. Skoronski and his teammates will have to pass-protect better against a formidable Dolphins’ pass rush. Week 14 matchup: vs. Miami Dolphins (Monday 7:15 p.m. CT) Ben Skowronek: Los Angeles Rams WR Skowronek had one of his best games of the season in the Rams’ 36-19 win against the Browns. He caught two receptions for 12 yards and saw the field for a season-high 38% of his team’s offensive snaps. Skowronek has been in a reserve role all year but he recieved more opportunities as Nacua missed some snaps with a shoulder sprain. The third-year receiver’s first grab went for six yards in the second quarter when he caught a checkdown before being stuffed by Browns safety Juan Thornhill. With less than a minute before halftime Skowronek brought in his second and last catch for another six yards contributing to a drive that ended in a Rams field goal. If Nacua misses next week with his injury Skowronek will be sure to capitalize on his increased playing time. Week 14 matchup: at Baltimore Ravens (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Anthony Walker Jr.: Cleveland Browns LB Walker returned from a hamstring injury in Cleveland’s 36-19 loss to the Rams. Likely out of caution he played just 58% of the Browns’ defensive snaps but he managed to record three tackles (two solo) and a pass deflection. In the first quarter he sprinted to reach Rams running back Kyren Williams and tackled him out of bounds. Despite his positive play safety Juan Thornhill drew an unnecessary roughness call that gave the Rams 15 yards of field position. Overall Walker has been valuable to the Browns’ defense as a run-stopper. He doesn’t offer much in pass coverage but the seven-year veteran has been a vital presence in the locker room. Walker will look to shut down Travis Etienne and the Jaguars at home on Sunday. Week 14 matchup: vs. Jacksonville Jaguars (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Adetomiwa Adebawore: Indianapolis Colts DE Adebawore continued to make an impact in his limited snaps in the Colts’ 31-28 win over the Titans. The rookie played a season-high 26 defensive snaps and recorded a quarterback hit. Adebawore did have a “welcome to the league” moment in the first quarter when Derrick Henry flattened him with his signature stiff arm on a nine-yard run. Drafted by Indianapolis in the fourth round Adebawore has 1.5 sacks on the season. He continues to play a reserve role behind DeForest Buckner but he’s making a difference when he manages to see the field. Adebawore will have a favorable matchup against Jake Browning and the Bengals’ lackluster offensive line. Week 14 matchup: at Cincinnati Bengals (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Blake Hance: Jacksonville Jaguars OL Hance saw the field more than usual in the Jaguars’ 34-31 overtime loss to the Bengals. He subbed in for 23 offensive snaps after left tackle Walker Little exited in the fourth quarter with a hamstring injury. The fourth-year lineman has been an important backup piece for Jacksonville. He has filled in for Little and Cam Robinson throughout the season and has also entered on jumbo packages. If Little can’t go next week look for Hance to get his first start of the season. Week 14 matchup: at Cleveland Browns (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Godwin Igwebuike: Pittsburgh Steelers RB Igwebuike fulfilled his role as the Steelers’ starting kick returner in their 24-10 loss to the Cardinals. He returned the game’s opening kick to the 24-yard line after muffing the catch and recovering it. Igwebuike also played 12 special teams snaps as a gunner in a game that saw Kenny Pickett exit with a high-ankle sprain. The sixth-year back has suited up for six NFL rosters (plus the XFL’s Seattle Dragons) in his career. Hopefully Igwebuike has found his role with the Steelers and will return to the team next season. He will try to continue to make an impression against the Patriots on Thursday night. Week 14 matchup: vs. New England Patriots (Thursday 7:15 p.m. CT) Trevor Siemian: New York Jets QB A new addition to the column Siemian entered the game in the fourth quarter of the Jets’ 13-8 loss to the Falcons. He went 5-for-13 with 66 passing yards took three sacks and coughed up three fumbles (one lost). The Jets wanted a change of scenery from the painfully unqualified Tim Boyle but Siemian still finished with the team’s second-lowest PFF grade (34.4).  The Broncos drafted Siemian in the seventh round in 2015 where he threw for 30 touchdowns and 24 interceptions in 24 starts. Since then he’s bounced around the league as a backup. Somehow the Jets might end up starting Siemian next week against the Texans — Tim Boyle is that bad and Zach Wilson is reportedly reluctant to start for New York again. We’ll just have to see who the Jets roll out on Sunday afternoon. Week 14 matchup: vs. Houston Texans (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Joseph Jones: Tennessee Titans LB After being inactive last week Jones played 27 special teams snaps in the Titans’ 31-28 win over the Colts. He didn’t record any statistics but he still contributed as a gunner for Tennessee. Jones went undrafted in 2017 and was signed off the Seahawks’ practice squad by the Broncos that November. The journeyman will look to get on the stat sheet against the Dolphins on Monday night. Week 14 matchup: vs. Miami Dolphins (Monday 7:15 p.m. CT) ‘Cats that didn’t play this week: Cameron Mitchell (Cleveland Browns) Dean Lowry (Minnesota Vikings torn pectoral) Tyler Lancaster (Denver Broncos) Earnest Brown IV (Los Angeles Rams) Evan Hull (Indianapolis Colts torn meniscus) Ifeadi Odenigbo (New York Jets injured reserve) Joe Gaziano (Atlanta Falcons) \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Along with Olympic champions such as Caeleb Dressel and Katie Ledecky the 2023 Toyota U.S. Open Swimming Championships featured seven Northwestern swimmers.  The U.S. Open is held in a long course 50-meter pool (the same format as the Olympic Games) unlike all of Northwestern’s collegiate competitions this season which are held in short course 25-yard pools. While this meet is not an NCAA-sanctioned meet times from the competition can be converted into short course yard times with a special conversion formula and used for NCAA Championship qualification. Junior Connor Morikawa had a strong swim in the men’s 200 breaststroke finishing 19th overall in a personal best time of 2:15.52. He also placed 41st in the 100 breaststroke (1:03.24). His 200 breast time is a 1.48-second improvement from his previous best set in April 2022 and also gets him under the 200 breast qualification time for the 2024 U.S. Olympic trials happening next June. This marks the second time Morikawa has made the Olympic trials previously competing in the 2021 edition of the meet.  Morikawa now joins a growing list of Northwestern swimmers qualified for U.S. Olympic trials. That list also includes graduate student Kevin Houseman and first-years Cade Duncan and Diego Nosack.  Graduate student Ayla Spitz also hit U.S. Olympic trials cut times at the U.S. Open but since she represents Israel internationally she is not eligible to swim at the meet. She qualified for the ‘B’ finals of the women’s 200-meter freestyle and 100-meter backstroke but because the two races came on the same night she opted to swim only the former event in the final and finished 15th overall (2:00.73). She also placed 52nd in the 100 free with a time of 56.80. Spitz’s time of 1:01.71 in the preliminary heats of the 100 back was a personal best time taking 0.04 off her previous best from December 2019.  Another top performer at the U.S. Open was Northwestern alum and 2023 World Championships bronze medalist Sophie Angus who currently trains at the High-Performance Center in Ontario Canada — the country she represents internationally. She won the ‘B’ final of the women’s 100 breast (1:08.86) placing 9th overall. She also finished 22nd in the ‘C’ final of the 200 breast (2:33.72).

Taxes. Chris Collins beating Matt Painter at Welsh-Ryan Arena. Share this story 292 days. The difference between the impossible turn and the repeat performance. The difference between the crown jewel of Northwestern’s 2023 March Madness resume and a taste of what 2024 has in store. The difference between Chase Audige’s 10 points in the last 3:33 of play and Ryan Langborg and Ty Berry pouring in a combined 41 points to aid a Boo Buie masterclass. New faces. New season. Same result. The first upset was a game close throughout. Purdue controlled the first half taking a 37-30 lead into the break. The Boilermakers led for almost 35 minutes but Northwestern’s resilience kept the ‘Cats hanging around waiting for a moment to pounce. Both teams traded buckets but Northwestern struggled to get within one possession. Trailing by one with 1:39 left in regulation Audige etched a memory Northwestern fans will never forget – a heroic corner three that sent Welsh-Ryan Arena into chaos and handed Northwestern the lead for good. That victory was all about emotion — a Boilermaker beatdown until the blur of an 18-6 Northwestern run over the final six minutes ended in Northwestern’s first of three student section storms against Purdue teams in 2023. What played as an ugly basketball game will be remembered for the story it started. The second game is defined by its second half. Purdue dominated the game’s opening 20 minutes playing at its own pace and dictating the terms of the contest. Northwestern was lucky to come into the second half trailing by only eight giving Buie and company an opportunity to claw back.  This time it only took the ‘Cats five minutes to even the score setting the stage for a heart-throbbing (or gut-wrenching?) end to regulation. Buie Berry and Langborg’s offense kept Northwestern in it punching Purdue in the mouth as the ‘Cats played their brand of gritty basketball. Audige’s three stands out as the game-defining play from beating Purdue the first time. Buie tried to give Northwestern fans a similar moment in the dying seconds of regulation with a finish eerily similar to his buzzer beater against Indiana last season.  Still thinking about this Boo bucket at the end of regulation pic.twitter.com/Eu9a8ENgyR But even with Buie’s magic Zach Edey and Purdue still managed to find an answer sending the game to overtime. The second upset had something the first one didn’t — an unhealthy amount of lead changes (18 total for the game) and razor thin margins throughout the second half. The mood shift inside Welsh-Ryan Arena from Buie’s floater to Edey’s equalizer was an 180-degree flip. Purdue jumped on the momentum swing opening up a 79-76 lead to begin overtime. But just like a cat with nine lives Buie and Berry swung back nailing huge threes to even things up 82-82. With the ‘Cats up a pair with 16 seconds remaining Blake Preston poked away Purdue’s last chance to secure Northwestern’s win. Last season featured a great basketball game. This season boasted a great game of basketball. Last season it was Matt Nicholson against Edey. This season it was Luke Hunger and Blake Preston battling against college basketball’s best player in crunch time. Last season it was a 64-58 comeback victory. This season it was a 92-88 overtime thriller. New season. New heroes. Same result. Northwestern knocked off No. 1 Purdue two seasons in a row   pic.twitter.com/crsMwDUxZe Northwestern’s repeat performance was nothing short of history. The ‘Cats became the first unranked squad to beat the same AP No. 1 team at home in consecutive campaigns and the seventh team since 2010-11 to beat an AP No. 1 in back-to-back seasons. The second upset shows this team is capable of everything that last year’s squad laid the groundwork for.  Beating Purdue to open conference play behind another big game performance from Buie — this time with a ridiculous 31 point 9 assist and 0 turnover statline — proved that this squad’s preseason expectations are real. However without Northwestern’s unlikely win back in February this program wouldn’t have been able to do it again. That win made the impossible possible showed miracles can happen and gave Northwestern the push to finish a five-game February win streak to make March Madness a reality. All that offseason momentum put stunning Purdue for a second time within reach. Feb. 12 2023 was and still is Northwestern’s biggest win in program history.  It was unexpected and unprecedented but it proved that the ‘Cats could hold their own against anyone. As the adrenaline rush of Northwestern’s first ever win over an AP No. 1 team subsided beating Purdue in February showed that the ‘Cats had a legitimate opportunity to make a postseason run. More importantly the win gave the ‘Cats the fuel to propel them to their best Big Ten finish since 1959. Last time it was impossible. This time it was unlikely but within the depths of imagination. Last time David beat Goliath. This time David knew how to beat Goliath. Last time allowed Northwestern fans to Dream On. This time allowed Northwestern fans to dream again.

Share this story The ‘Cats are going to take on the Utah Utes in the SRS Distributions Las Vegas Bowl on Dec. 23. The game will be broadcast on ABC at 6:30 p.m. CT. Here are five things to know about the Utes. Bryson Barnes is a solid quarterback Last year starting quarterback Cam Rising suffered a severe knee injury in the Rose Bowl against Ohio State. Utah hoped that he would return this year but Rising was ruled out for the season in October. After battling for the job with Nate Johnson at the beginning of the year Bryson Barnes won. Last week Johnson entered the transfer portal so Utah doesn’t have much depth behind Barnes. Barnes has had a productive season so far throwing for 1517 yards and 12 touchdowns. Additionally he is Utah’s fourth-leading rusher with 267 yards. The ‘Cats will have to be ready for the quarterback run game when they square off with the Utes’ offense. Although Barnes recently announced that he is also entering the transfer portal after this season he is still going to play against Northwestern.  Sione Vaki is a Swiss Army Knife Vaki started off the season solely as a safety but has proven to be much more. This year he is fourth on the team with 50 tackles. However as the season has gone on he has been integrated into the offense. With running back Micah Bernard out for the season and ball carrier Ja’Quinden Jackson picking up a minor injury in Week Four the Utes had a hole at running back. Vaki’s first game action as a running back was in Week Five against Oregon State. The next week against California he had 15 carries for 158 yards and two touchdowns. Vaki has also shown how valuable he can be as a receiver. In a win over USC Vaki had five catches for 149 yards and two touchdowns. In the weeks since Vaki has continued to play on offense and defense; however head coach Kyle Whittingham has limited Vaki’s offensive snaps to preserve his legs.  While Utah’s running back room has gotten healthier with Jackson returning Northwestern will have to keep an eye out for when Vaki is in the game. He is an extremely explosive weapon for Utah. The Utes will be without a key contributor Utah won’t have wide receiver Devaughn Vele for their bowl game. On Sunday the 6-foot-5-inch receiver declared for the NFL Draft. This is a huge loss for Utah as Vele is the team’s leading receiver with 593 yards this season. He has more than double the receiving yards than the Utes’ next highest pass catcher. Vele is also tied for the most receiving touchdowns on the team.  Vele joined the team in 2019 as a walk-on and has worked his way to becoming the offense’s top receiver. He is coming off his two best games of the season against Washington and Arizona. Against the Huskies Vele had five catches for 145 yards and he had nine catches for 111 yards and a touchdown against Arizona. The absence of Vele boosts Northwestern’s chances. Utah is led by a fantastic coach Kyle Whittingham is one of the longest tenured coaches in the country. In 2005 Whittingham took over for Urban Meyer after Meyer left to go to Florida. Since then Whittingham has been Utah’s head coach. His team has been a model of consistency as they have had a winning record in 17 of his 19 seasons. Over the last five years Whittingham has guided his team to three 10-win seasons.   Earlier this week David Braun said that he admires Utah’s program and that it has been a model for him in constructing Northwestern’s roster. Braun did professional development with the Utes and was able to see how the team was built. Braun wants to build his team similarly to the way Whittingham has: developmental complementary and physical.  The Utes were ranked No. 10 this season Following a win over UCLA Utah moved to 4-0 on the season and were ranked No. 10 in the country. The Utes have stumbled a little down the stretch but their four losses have all been against ranked teams. Their losses this year are against Oregon State Oregon Washington and Arizona. The Utes only lost by seven points on the road against Washington. Even though Utah doesn’t have a dominant offense or defense it is sound on both sides. Defensively the team has held opponents to 14 points or fewer in six games this year. Offensively the Utes have scored 28 points or more five times this season highlighted by a 55-point outing against Arizona State. Utah has a lot of solid pieces and will be a tough test for Northwestern. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story As the sport of college football has changed diametrically in recent years with elements like realignment and NIL coming to the forefront the transfer portal has entered that same fray. Now twice (if not more barring coaching changes) per calendar year players have an opportunity to place their names in the portal and find a new destination to call home. In many ways college football has developed its own period of free agency. For Northwestern and every other team that window opened officially this past Monday. In that span of six days nearly 1100 Division I players have placed their names in the portal including a slew of would-be NFL Draft picks and/or all-conference selections. For the Wildcats four athletes have done so: LG Josh Priebe QB Cole Freeman DL Matt Lawson and DB Nigel Williams. Even though NU is still working its way through bowl preparations in advance of its date with Utah on Dec. 23 in the Las Vegas Bowl David Braun’s first legitimate offseason as head coach has already truly begun. That’s even apparent in analyzing the Utes who have seen their top receiver (Devaughn Vele) and top two defenders by snap count (Sione Vaki and Cole Bishop) declare for the 2024 NFL Draft. Last Sunday subsequent to determining its bowl game fate Braun spoke to the media where he had a chance to reflect about the current state of the program and its directions moving forward. In regard to the portal Braun noted that the focus is on “being really intentional about the things that matter right now” stressing that an emphasis is being placed on talking to current players about their desires. Moreover Braun was candid about how Northwestern plans to utilize the transfer portal — as a clear-cut supplement to high school recruiting and development. “As we know at Northwestern this model will not change” Braun said. “We’ll have some transfers but this program will be built off of very thorough high school recruiting. … We’re just different.” That aforementioned structure has generally worked for the Wildcats so it’s easy to understand why Braun wants to mirror it as he enters Year Two and beyond. At the same time putting the portal on somewhat of an afterburner raises a number of qualms. For one if NU isn’t pursuant of top talent in this window it inherently restricts which players will be at its disposal when it looks back to the portal in the spring period with a more cerebral understanding of roster weaknesses. The vast majority of these current transfer players will have found a destination by the time the winter portal closes on Jan. 2 which means the ‘Cats won’t get another crack at this specific bunch. In this case that includes a boatload of immense quarterback talent — like Duke’s Riley Leonard Kansas State’s Will Howard UCLA’s Dante Moore and more — plus headliners and former five-stars at virtually every position. With the looming departure of Ben Bryant and Freeman it’s likely that Northwestern will have to add a QB at some point this offseason. Admittedly it’s not as if the Wildcats truly need one of those aforementioned signal-callers but they innately pigeonhole themselves if they wait until the spring for someone under center let alone any position. It’s not only about filling positions of need either. By being somewhat aggressive in the portal now NU has the capacity to demonstrate that it’s not content with a 7-5 finish and indicate to both stellar recruits and top-flight programs that it wants to compete to build the best roster it can. That rings especially true when four hyper-competitive programs will enter the Big Ten next year not to mention other rivals (e.g. Minnesota Wisconsin) already zeroing in on starting quarterbacks. To be fair the Wildcats have done that to some extent by offering Penn DL Joey Slackman ranked as 247 Sports’ 22nd overall player in the portal. Otherwise though Northwestern has scarcely been tied to premium players if at all. There is definitely truth and a feel-good sentiment to the concept of wanting to finish the 2023 season in full and thus waiting until the final whistle blows from Allegiant Stadium in two weeks. At the same time in the modern context of college football doing that can pose some significant concerns. NU came head-to-head with them when Priebe a senior and captain declared his intentions. In his statement Priebe mentioned “uncertainty surrounding Coach [Kurt] Anderson’s future here” plus “no timeline for when coaching changes will be made.” Even if Braun has a rather thorough understanding of which players/coaches will stay and go that element of hedging can drive wedges in a sport where people are trending toward quicker decisions. Frankly it’s not as if the portal is the be all end all for teams around the nation. Look toward Madison or Boulder Colorado to see two squads that fell rather flatly on their faces despite incorporating fresh names with high-star ratings. Braun is correct in wanting to have recruiting be the program’s backbone. Even then though Northwestern’s last two successful seasons have been buoyed by transfers — like Ben Bryant Cam Johnson Peyton Ramsey and John Raine — which probably isn’t a coincidence. Ultimately the ‘Cats have found a model that seems to work for them over the last few years which is generally landing transfers later in the year (e.g. Bryant A.J. Henning Richie Hagarty etc.). Yet as Braun begins his first bonafide cycle at the helm it offers a chance to reevaluate his process one which will need tweaking as the Wildcats navigate a revamped CFB landscape. In 2023 it’s hard to contend that Northwestern’s shouldn’t already be looking to its 2024 roster via the portal’s first window — attracting impact players as early as possible while still maintaining its priorities of fit and character. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story With the ‘Cats slated to play their first bowl game since January 2021 it’s only right to remind readers of the team’s postseason history. NU has played 16 bowl games and won six including its last four. Let’s recount every postseason showdown the purple and white have appeared in leading up to Las Vegas.  1949 Rose Bowl Result: 20-14 win over California The ‘Cats (7-2) entered their first bowl game appearance in program history as a 6.5-point favorite to the Golden Bears (10-0). Michigan finished first in the Big Nine but NU benefitted from the conference’s no-repeat rule that was finally scrapped in 1972.  NU’s Frank Aschenbrenner ran for 119 yards on the day including a 73-yard touchdown that broke a Rose Bowl record. In the fourth quarter the ‘Cats snapped the ball directly to halfback Ed Tunnicliff who darted past the Golden Bears to the end zone. PeeWee Day sealed the game for NU with a last-minute interception giving the purple and white their first bowl win. The ‘Cats found a way despite converting just seven first downs to Cal’s 12.  1996 Rose Bowl Result: 41-32 loss to USC NU returned to Pasadena almost a half-century later squaring off against Keyshawn Johnson and the Trojans. To open the 1995 season the ‘Cats took down No. 9 Notre Dame in South Bend — from there “Expect Victory” became their defining motto. They went 10-2 including an undefeated record in eight Big Ten games earning a No. 3 ranking entering the New Year’s showdown. The ‘Cats couldn’t find the same success in sunny California. Trojans QB Brad Otton threw for 391 yards with 216 of those going to Johnson — the Jets would draft the 6-foot-4 receiver first overall just three months later. NU held a 32-31 lead in the beginning of the fourth quarter but the Trojans scored 10 unanswered points to earn a win for the home crowd. 1997 Citrus Bowl Result: 48-28 loss to Tennessee NU sported a stellar defense in 1996 led by two-time national DPOY Pat Fitzgerald. Unfortunately it was on the wrong side of history on New Year’s Day. Peyton Manning put up 408 passing yards and four touchdowns on the ‘Cats who dealt with a flu outbreak and received IVs in the stuffy Orlando heat. The Vols got out a 21-0 lead in the first quarter but Northwestern fired back with three touchdowns of its own. In the second half the ‘Cats couldn’t keep up as quarterback Steve Schnur threw three picks including a crushing 30-yard pick-six. Tennessee finished with 523 total yards to Northwestern’s 285. 2000 Alamo Bowl  Result: 66-17 loss to Nebraska The Wildcats’ bowl woes continued into the next millennium. In the biggest blowout in Alamo Bowl history the Huskers scored 31 second-quarter points and never looked back.  ‘Cats back Damien Anderson who finished fifth in Heisman voting three weeks prior rushed for 149 yards and a touchdown. Despite his best efforts the ‘Cats simply couldn’t stop Nebraska’s rushing attack. Fullback Dan Alexander rumbled for 240 yards and two scores and quarterback Eric Crouch rushed and threw for two touchdowns each.  2003 Motor City Bowl Result: 28-24 loss to Bowling Green It was all about the ground game for the ‘Cats in Detroit. Running backs Jason Wright and Noah Herron combined for 317 rushing yards and three touchdowns. Wright’s touchdown run went for 77 yards — the second-longest in Motor City Bowl history. But NU simply couldn’t stop Bowling Green’s passing attack. Josh Harris threw for a whopping 386 yards and three touchdowns; on the other side NU signal-caller Brett Basanez went just 7-for-15 for 58 yards without a touchdown pass. The ‘Cats’ one-dimensional offense wasn’t enough to keep up with the Falcons who finished the season ranked No. 24. 2005 Sun Bowl Result: 50-38 loss to UCLA Basanez was far more active for NU against the Bruins throwing for 416 yards and two touchdowns on 70 attempts. He and the ‘Cats came out firing putting up 22 unanswered points to begin the game. Their fortunes quickly changed as UCLA began clicking on the ground and through the air; the Bruins went on a 29-point run of their own entering halftime. The Bruins’ two-headed monster of Chris Markey and Kahlil Bell combined for 299 rushing yards and a pair of touchdowns. NU’s defense simply couldn’t keep up which wasn’t necessarily a surprise — it allowed an FBS-worst 480.4 yards per game in 2005.  2008 Alamo Bowl Result: 30-23 (OT) loss to Missouri The “Journalism Bowl” pitted the No. 23 ‘Cats against the No. 21 Tigers with the latter entering the day as a 12.5-point favorite. NU intercepted Chase Daniel on Mizzou’s opening drive and QB C.J. Bacher found Eric Peterman in the end zone on a 35-yard shot. The two teams were tied at 10-10 entering halftime and again knotted at 23-23 after 60 minutes of play.  The Tigers won the coin toss in overtime — and it didn’t take long for Daniel to find Jeremy Maclin for a seven-yard touchdown. Northwestern had a chance to respond but a devastating strip sack eventually led to a game-ending turnover on downs. The crushing overtime result marked NU’s sixth straight bowl loss. 2010 Outback Bowl Result: 38-35 (OT) loss to Auburn Another shootout another shattering loss in overtime. In his first season as a starter senior quarterback Mike Kafka led the ‘Cats to an 8-4 record. The captain set plenty of bowl game records attempting 78 passes for 532 passing yards. Oh and he threw for four touchdowns and five interceptions. Yikes. Starting kicker Stefan Demos was injured in the overtime period forcing Pat Fitzgerald to send out the backup to kick the game-tying field goal. Instead in true Randy Walker fashion the ‘Cats attempted a fumblerooski — receiver Zeke Markshausen circled back for a handoff but was stopped at the 2-yard line. Though the final score wasn’t in NU’s favor this bowl game was one of the most entertaining products in college football history. 2011 TicketCity Bowl Result: 45-38 loss to Texas Tech NU entered Dallas without starting quarterback Dan Persa who tore his Achilles in November. In his place Fitzgerald started Evan Watkins and incorporated wildcat QB Kain Colter. The two signal-callers combined for just 114 passing yards but Colter led the rushing attack with 105 yards and two touchdowns. The Red Raiders held a commanding 21-point lead in the third quarter when head coach Tommy Tuberville decided to try an onside kick. The ‘Cats recovered and would get as close as within seven in the final frame. But Taylor Potts was too much for NU’s defense as he earned MVP honors with 369 passing yards and five total touchdowns.  2011 Meineke Car Care Bowl of Texas Result: 33-22 loss to Texas A&M This was Northwestern’s second bowl in the 2011 calendar year squaring off against another Texas team in the Lone Star State. Dan Persa and the ‘Cats held a 7-3 lead in the second quarter but Texas A&M put up 27 unanswered points to set up a commanding victory. Aggies quarterback Ryan Tannehill won game MVP after throwing for 329 yards and a touchdown. He got plenty of help from his defense who sacked Persa and Kain Colter eight times. For those counting at home this was Northwestern’s ninth straight bowl loss. 2013 Gator Bowl Result: 34-20 win over Mississippi State At last! The No. 20 ‘Cats got out to a 13-0 lead in the second quarter after intercepting Bulldogs quarterback Tyler Russell three times. NU’s quarterback tandem of Trevor Siemian and Kain Colter tossed three picks of their own but the rushing attack picked them up. The ‘Cats ran for 161 yards plus three touchdowns in the second half of action. NU’s bowl win snapped a nine-game losing streak that was tied with Notre Dame for the longest in NCAA history. This victory was Pat Fitzgerald’s 50th as head coach surpassing Pappy Waldorf as the winningest coach in program history. 2016 Outback Bowl Result: 45-6 loss to Tennessee NU entered New Year’s Day ranked No. 13 in the nation while the Vols sat 10 spots lower. But the CFP rankings didn’t seem to matter as Tennessee’s run game single-handedly dismantled the ‘Cats. As a team the Vols stormed for 226 yards and five touchdowns on the ground. The purple and white played catch-up from the very beginning. QBs Clayton Thorson and Zack Oliver combined for four interceptions without a touchdown pass. Justin Jackson was a bright spot for the ‘Cats as he rushed for 74 yards and found the end zone in the second quarter. 2016 Pinstripe Bowl Result: 31-24 win over Pittsburgh Like his entire career as a Wildcat Jackson was the star of the show in the Bronx. He shredded the Panthers for 224 rushing yards and three scores on 32 carries. Jackson put the ‘Cats up 14-3 in the second quarter but Pitt responded with two touchdowns of its own. Yet JJTBC wasn’t done — he regained the lead for NU with a 40-yard house call in the next frame. The ‘Cats scored 10 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to secure their third bowl win in program history. It was no surprise when Jackson was named MVP of the game. 2017 Music City Bowl Result: 24-23 win over Kentucky NU lost Thorson early to a leg injury but Jackson picked up the slack as always. He earned MVP honors again for his 157 rushing yards and two touchdowns. Second-string RB Jeremy Larkin was no slouch either — he stormed for 112 yards on just nine carries. The ‘Cats held it down on the defensive end when it mattered most. They limited Kentucky to just 65 rushing yards on 22 carries despite allowing 107.8 rushing yards per game in 2017 (eighth-most in FBS).  2018 Holiday Bowl Result: 31-20 win over Utah The ‘Cats had their work cut out for them in San Diego. Utah sported an elite defense that gave up just 19.4 points per game which was 19th in the FBS. Worse yet the Utes were fourth in the FBS in allowing 101.4 rush yards per game.  In a shocking turn of events it was NU’s defense that dominated the game. In the third quarter alone the ‘Cats scored 21 points off three Utah turnovers. Safety Jared McGee returned a fumble for an 82-yard touchdown as part of a stellar showing from the purple and white. Utah was a seven-point favorite but the ‘Cats overcame the odds by becoming agents of chaos. 2021 Citrus Bowl Result: 35-19 win over Auburn The No. 14 Wildcats were favorited coming into Orlando driven by a lockdown defense that surrendered the fifth-fewest points per game in the FBS (15.9). NU got out to an early 14-0 lead behind two TD passes from Peyton Ramsey. However two field goals and a 57-yard touchdown from Bo Nix put Auburn within one in the third quarter. But the ‘Cats fired back with three straight scores to reach a 35-13 lead. Auburn managed to find the end zone once more but it wasn’t enough to keep up. Ramsey was named MVP after throwing for 291 yards and three touchdowns. This was Pat Fitzgerald’s final bowl win before his termination in July 2023. 2023 Las Vegas Bowl Result: TBD NU will square off against Utah on Dec. 23 and look to win its first bowl under head coach David Braun. The Utes have lost 12 players to the transfer portal and more to the NFL Draft since their regular-season finale including star receiver Devaughn Vele and defensive back JaTravis Broughton.  The Wildcats are riding a three-game winning streak including an electrifying 45-43 victory at Illinois on Nov. 25. Utah is currently favored by 6.5 points but don’t discount the Cardiac ‘Cats as they look to cap off an impressive season. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story The ‘Cats had no Sunday Scaries after a week layoff. Northwestern (7-1 1-0 B1G) demolished Detroit Mercy (0-10 0-2 Horizon) 91-59. NU led from start to finish in this one never facing a serious threat. Boo Buie sat the final nine minutes of the blowout. The Wildcats were led by the unexpected trio of Ty Berry Ryan Langborg and Nick Martinelli. The trio combined for 57 points and nine assists. Martinelli had a career-high 22 points. Buie who only had five points distributed eight assists on the game. Brooks Barnhizer added 13 points and nine rebounds. The ‘Cats won the opening tip and Langborg drilled a three to get NU on the board. The squads traded baskets evening the score at 5-5 until Berry connected from the midrange to give the Wildcats a 7-5 lead at the first media timeout. A few minutes later Detroit Mercy cut the lead to 10-16 but a technical foul on the Titans gave Buie two chances at the free throw line which he split. However on the ensuing possession Matt Nicholson found Martinelli on the baseline for an easy layup. A couple of possessions later Barnhizer finally found the back of the net for a three ball and followed it up with a block on the defensive side. The ball bounced back to the Titans for an easy layup but Langborg responded with a three of his own to make it 27-17. Martinelli tacked on another three to make it 32-19 at the under-8 timeout. Out of the timeout both teams went cold from the field scoring in just the single digits combined. Northwestern did not hit a field goal for nearly three minutes until Langborg cashed his third triple of the game to make it 37-26 NU with 3:37 left in the first half. In the remaining minutes of the half Langborg continued his hot shooting drilling his fourth three of the half. Martinelli reached double digits with a layup but the Titans continued to find ways to keep the game close. As the clock struck zero the ‘Cats held a 43-33 lead at the half. Out of the locker room Barnhizer was wide open under the basket for an easy layup and he found Nicholson for an easy slam on the next possession. Berry rattled off five straight points to turn it into a 9-0 run giving NU a 52-33 lead with 16 minutes left. ""Berry and Langborg connected again from beyond the arc and Buie made his first field goal of the game to make 60-37. A couple of minutes later Martinelli finished a three-point play and hit a close-range shot to make it 67-45 halfway through the frame. An and-one from Berry plus a bucket from Buie and Luke Hunger made it 74-47 with 8:30 left in the game. The ‘Cats cruised through the rest of the game with Chris Collins clearing the bench for the back half of the final frame. By the time the buzzer sounded the Cats had won 91-59.""

Share this story One response just wasn’t enough.  Despite an encouraging second-quarter comeback that put Northwestern within three points of Maryland at halftime on the road the Terrapins (7-3 1-0 B1G) rode a strong third quarter to hand the Wildcats (3-6 0-1 B1G) their first loss in Big Ten play in a 71-58 Terps win. A balanced scoring attack propelled the home team which forced 19 turnovers and got to the free throw line 23 times in contrast to just seven attempts for Northwestern. Allie Kubek led all scorers with 17 points with Jakia Brown-Turner and Shyanne Sellers contributing 13 points apiece. Sellers also shined on the defensive end where she picked up two blocks and five steals. For Northwestern Melannie Daley led the way with 14 points on 7-of-12 shooting. Casey Harter dropped 10 points in her first start as a Wildcat in place of Daley while Hailey Weaver scored nine. After a few misses to open the action Weaver and Kubek traded layups. Those buckets as well as a Bri McDaniel layup were the brightest offensive spot during a stretch where both teams shot a combined 3-of-13 from the field to start. Northwestern went on a four-minute scoring drought which the Terps capitalized on with a 6-0 run. Unfazed Caileigh Walsh broke an 0-of-4 shooting start with a layup and Weaver followed that up with a score in transition to bring the score to 10-8 Maryland with four minutes left in the first quarter. Daley who came off the bench for the first time this season checked in after the media timeout and got on the board to tie the game. The Terrapins answered with another 6-0 run forcing Daley to turn it over twice. No. 21 briefly stopped the run with a midrange jumper but Maryland punctuated the period with another fastbreak score off Daley’s third turnover of the quarter to take a 22-14 lead through 10 minutes. A number of fouls on both sides slowed down the start of the second quarter in which another midrange J from Daley marked the only field goal of the first three minutes. However a couple of free throws and a Sellers score vaulted Maryland again giving the Terps their largest edge of the day at 25-16.  The Wildcats responded with force. Daley cashed in another shot to get to eight points and  Walsh quickly got going inside to pick up six points in two minutes. Lau shined as a playmaker and the defense stiffened up. Suddenly the ‘Cats found themselves within three. Continuing the run a stepback three from Harter evened it up at 27. Sellers finally provided an answer with a jump shot but Weaver responded with a thrilling sequence. Her steal-and-score led to an and-one in transition which gave the ‘Cats a 30-29 lead. The Terps continued to get to the free throw line though picking up four points at the charity stripe to respond. The half then ended with a bang as Sellers answered another Harter trey with a buzzer-beating triple. It put the Terrapins up 36-33 going into the break. All things considered the second quarter might’ve been Northwestern’s best 10 minutes of the season. It looked down and out when it fell behind by nine points but the ‘Cats responded with balanced basketball on both ends of the floor. They forced five turnovers in the quarter and snagged five offensive rebounds.  Brinae Alexander kept the momentum going for UMD with a corner three and a free throw from Brown-Turner gave the Terrapins a seven-point lead. McDaniel created a bucket for herself and Sellers extended Maryland’s edge to 44-33 with another layup. Paige Mott put NU on the board with a layup but Brown-Turner intercepted a pass from Lau on the next possession to spark another McDaniel score. A pair of free throws from Faith Masonius put the Terps ahead by 13. Down but not out Daley continued her strong shooting performance with two more jumpers. Yet UMD answered each one to hold a 52-39 advantage. It went on to tack on four more points before the end of the third quarter to go up by 17. Two more Maryland scores gave it a 21-point cushion but two-point makes from Lau and Harter cut NU’s deficit to 62-45. However the ‘Cats wouldn’t get closer than 13 points behind as the Terps closed out their home victory without much trouble.

Share this story After a week off for finals the ‘Cats (7-1 1-0 B1G) got rolling again on Sunday against Detroit Mercy (0-10 0-2 Horizon League). Putting the joy of beating No. 1 Purdue (again) in the rearview mirror Northwestern was able to lock in and take care of business defeating the Titans 91-59. Without major contributions from leading scorer Boo Buie Northwestern leaned on some of its secondary scorers to get the job done and they did more than enough. Here are three takeaways from the blowout victory: Nick Martinelli is legitimately better than last year Yes I know it was against an 0-10 Horizon League team but Martinelli’s career day is impossible to ignore. The sophomore racked up 22 points leading the team on 10-of-12 shooting to go along with six rebounds. He did this all in just 23 minutes of playing time. Those are pretty ridiculous numbers especially for a guy who has been just a rotational piece for his entire career so far. Martinelli impressed enough as a freshman to see minutes down the stretch but they were not significant (he averaged 9.9 minutes last season). Heading into this year it was relatively uncertain what kind of expanded role he would play if any and whether he would show noticeable improvement. Well after yesterday he has.  Is Martinelli capable of regularly contributing to the number on the scoreboard to this extent? No. Northwestern will play better teams and he will take more of a back seat. But is it realistic to see him play quality minutes off the bench with a knack for putting the ball through the bucket? Absolutely. It’s officially time to worry about Matt Nicholson “Big Matt” didn’t get in foul trouble against the Titans yet he still played just 22 minutes and scored just five points. Perhaps even more concerning the 7-foot senior only corralled five boards in the contest. The game brought Nicholson’s season averages to 4.9 points and 3.6 rebounds down from his marks of 6.3 points and 5.4 rebounds a season ago.  Nicholson’s statistical regression so far this season has not been good and if he doesn’t get into gear here soon it’s an enormous problem for Northwestern. Somehow the Wildcats got past Purdue without an effective Nicholson but that isn’t going to happen consistently in Big Ten play. The ‘Cats need him; they really do. Otherwise it’s up to an inexperienced Luke Hunger and transfer Blake Preston to pick up the slack.  Nicholson doesn’t have to be a world-beater on the offensive end of the floor but he should be contributing more than this. Boo Buie said he and Zach Edey were the two best players in the country. He has certainly been the best post player on his own team and that can’t be the case. Ty Berry might be breaking out Early on this season it looked as if Northwestern had three go-to scorers: Buie Ryan Langborg and Brooks Barnhizer. Now a fourth may be emerging in Ty Berry. Berry was magnificent against Purdue helping to drag the ‘Cats across the finish line with some crucial threes in overtime. He followed up that performance with 16 points against Detroit Mercy on 6-of-8 shooting. The biggest difference between Berry last year and Berry this year has been his efficiency. He shot 34.2% from the floor last season as well as 29.1% from beyond the arc. His jumper looked flat all season and you could sense the frustration. That has not been the case so far in his senior season. Berry is shooting the lights out knocking down 49.3% of shots from the field and 45% of his threes. Berry’s shot looks smoother and has more arc. He’s also pulling up from NBA distance less often which I’m sure Chris Collins is thrilled about. Inconsistency plagued Berry last season and there’s always a chance he comes and goes as a scorer throughout this season but he’s put us all on notice. Berry might be here to stay as a major contributing piece for this year’s Northwestern team. The No. 25 Wildcats will be back in action Wednesday night to take on Chicago State at Welsh-Ryan Arena. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story With just over three minutes left in the second quarter against Maryland the cylinders appeared to be finally clicking for Northwestern women’s basketball.  Casey Harter stared UMD’s Emily Fisher right in the face from the top of the key. Jab right one dribble right step back swish. Harter the first-year starting her first game at the collegiate level had just put the exclamation point on an 11-2 run that brought the ‘Cats back from a nine-point deficit just three minutes earlier. The three-pointer made the game a brand-new one by evening it up at 27. But it did more than just renew the game itself. It was a breath of fresh air for Harter who had missed her first three shots. It reopened NU’s offense which hadn’t converted a three before Harter’s make and was shooting 9-of-27 from the field at that point.  Most importantly amid a four-game losing streak the splash baptized the Wildcats by wiping their season’s slate clean and legitimizing their aspirations to start anew in Big Ten play. If that wasn’t enough another game-tying trey by Harter just two minutes later punctuated what might have been Northwestern’s best quarter of basketball all year considering the quality of opponent and the game’s location. The ‘Cats were in prime position to go toe-to-toe with a Maryland team that has not lost at the XFINITY Center since Dec. 4 2022 and potentially redefine their season. Ultimately they failed to do so in their 13-point loss for a number of reasons many of which have led to the Wildcats’ 3-6 start. Northwestern committed 19 turnovers overall and it shot 34% from the field in the second half. It couldn’t consistently generate quality looks inside the paint while Maryland successfully attacked the basket and got to the free throw line 23 times. What made life even harder for the ‘Cats was that they started slow — again — and ended the first quarter down eight points. Those issues persisted from the tipoff to the final horn which is why the Terps dominated NU in the second half. They’ve been around since Game One. But what appears to be new is the flash of concrete progress that the ‘Cats displayed during their second-quarter run. Early deficits haven’t plagued Northwestern because they’ve occurred. They’ve buried it because those holes have tended to grow into insurmountable gaps. It’s happened each of the three times NU has played outside of Welsh-Ryan Arena this season and its resounding 110-52 loss to No. 14 Notre Dame in South Bend was a prime example. Resilience wasn’t manifesting itself on the scoreboard which has made Northwestern’s recent losing streak especially concerning. Down 25-16 to the Terrapins NU reversed course by putting on its second-quarter run capped off by Harter’s threes. The first-year wasn’t Northwestern’s only strength; Caileigh Walsh bounced back from a 1-of-6 start to provide a strong paint presence both as a scorer and a defender. Melannie Daley who came off the bench cashed in midrange jumpers at will en route to another efficient afternoon. Caroline Lau shined as a facilitator both in space and in a half-court offense. The ‘Cats forced five Maryland turnovers in the period and secured five offensive rebounds. With their backs against the wall they responded before a win fell out of reach. As good as that stretch was it may not have even featured the best version of Joe McKeown’s team which turned it over seven times in the second quarter alone. That further proves Northwestern can hang with almost any team when three or four members of its core are complementing each other by successfully playing their roles on both ends of the floor.  The question with this team — as it has been for the last 13 months — is how consistently it can do that. The fatal blow didn’t come early in College Park. It came in the third quarter which Maryland took by a 20-6 edge right after Northwestern had seemingly put itself in position for a dogfight. The Wildcats shot 3-of-16 from the field (1-of-13 not including Daley) got out-rebounded 15-8 and gave the rock away six times.  The transition of momentum wasn’t gradual. It was swift and UMD seized a double-digit lead it wouldn’t relinquish before anyone could blink. NU only had one response in its bag on the day and couldn’t deliver anything close to a counterpunch. It followed up an 11-2 run by allowing a 15-2 one. The Wildcats may have laid a strong foundation down on Sunday. However with just three more nonconference tilts left before Big Ten play kicks into full gear they’ll need to build on it quickly.      \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story As Northwestern gears up to face Utah in the upcoming SRS Distribution Las Vegas Bowl the ‘Cats also find themselves navigating through one of the busiest periods on the collegiate calendar — the opening of the first transfer portal. Since the portal opened on Dec. 4 more than 1100 Division-1 student-athletes have entered their names looking for a new home. While Big Ten rivals like Purdue and Michigan State have witnessed over 15 players enter the portal Northwestern has only had four student-athletes make that decision: QB Cole Freeman DL Matt Lawson DB Nigel Williams and LG Josh Priebe. Despite having only a couple of players enter their names in the portal Northwestern is still projected to enter 2024 with several holes across its roster. However these areas of need could be addressed through the portal. Here’s a look at a few positions of need and players who might be a good fit. Defensive Line Even though Northwestern is expected to retain a substantial portion of its defensive line production from this season the Wildcats still face challenges in this unit having finished ninth in the Big Ten with only 25 sacks this year. Additionally the team is poised to lose multiple veteran and reserve players on the defensive line with Lawson being the first confirmed member actively seeking a new team. If head coach David Braun can successfully recruit these defensive linemen to Evanston for the 2024 season it would be a significant boost for Northwestern. After a quiet first two years at Tulane Deal burst onto the scene in his third season with the Green Wave where he recorded 40 tackles four sacks and 12 tackles for a loss. His breakout year has made him a hot commodity in the portal but the Wildcats may have a leg up considering Northwestern offered Deal a scholarship in high school. If Northwestern can land the speedy and powerful pass rusher the second time around it would be a gigantic addition to the defensive line unit. It would be a home run if Northwestern could land Slackman. The defensive lineman enters the portal as one of the most sought-after players after a prolific career at Penn where he recorded 115 total tackles 25 tackles for loss and 11 sacks. Northwestern has already begun its pursuit of Slackman by offering him a scholarship shortly after he announced his departure from Penn. It will be a tough battle for Braun and his staff to land Slackman as the Penn product has offers from schools such as Michigan Oregon Florida Washington and USC. However if the Wildcats can secure him he has the potential to elevate their defensive line unit to new heights. Wide Receiver  With Cam Johnson leaving Evanston and Bryce Kirtz possibly following suit the Wildcats find themselves needing to retool their wide receiver corps this offseason. This year the duo contributed to more than half of Northwestern’s 2401 passing yards as they combined for 1317 receiving yards. Aside from A.J. Henning who ended the year with 361 receiving yards no other wide receiver on the roster came close to rivaling the production of Johnson and Kirtz which presents challenges for the Wildcats in the future if they don’t address the position. If Northwestern can add any of these players it would substantially boost the Wildcats’ offense next year. Lewis entered the portal after struggling to secure a role in two seasons at Wisconsin. Despite his limited time on the field for the Badgers he displayed flashes of being an elite-level deep threat due to his blazing speed and 6-foot-2 196-pound frame. Given his Illinois roots and a previous offer from Northwestern in high school the Wildcats could emerge as a legitimate suitor to land the deep-threat wide receiver. During his three seasons at Northern Illinois Rudolph turned into quite the playmaker hauling in 111 receptions 1623 receiving yards and nine touchdowns. Additionally he rushed for 282 yards and had 1388 return yards including one kick returned for a touchdown. Rudolph’s versatility could introduce a significant spark to Northwestern’s offense addressing an element that sometimes seemed absent this past season. Rudolph is an Illinois native so a homecoming could be possible. Running Back Whether Cam Porter decides to return to Evanston for another season or not the Wildcats still need to add another player to the backfield to ease the load on the running back position. This year with an increased role due to the departure of Evan Hull Porter was solid on the ground rushing for 618 yards and four touchdowns but struggled to be an effective receiver with only 19 receptions for 104 yards. Fortunately for the Wildcats there is a wealth of talent at the running back position in the portal.  Love’s first three years at Illinois were hindered by the presence of current Cincinnati Bengals running back Chase Brown who held starting duties. However when Love got a starting opportunity this year he shined leading Illinois with 567 rushing yards and scoring four touchdowns. If the Wildcats can lure Love away from their cross-state rival it would be a massive pickup for their running back room. After five years at Boston College Garwo enters the portal with an impressive resume that includes over 1900 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns. Throughout his time at Boston College the running back consistently displayed good awareness and vision in the open field and elite burst. The veteran could immediately stabilize Northwestern’s backfield.              \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Last week the media outlet InsideLacrosse published its rankings for the top returning 50 players in women’s collegiate lacrosse. Five Northwestern players — junior midfielder Samantha Smith (no. 38) sophomore attacker Madison Taylor (no. 15) junior Samantha White (no. 8) graduate student attacker Erin Coykendall (no. 2) and graduate student attacker Izzy Scane (no. 1) — made the list. So what do these rankings all mean? Rankings from the media have zero influence on a player’s performance but they do give us an idea of what’s expected of certain athletes in the upcoming season so there’s still a lot to take away from this. The biggest story is of course Scane and Coykendall being ranked 1-2. Now Scane at the top isn’t surprising given that she won the 2023 Tewarraton Award. However Coykendall’s position right behind her teammate is what’s significant. As one of the five Tewarraton finalists last season she was already considered one of the best players in college lacrosse. However she was notably ranked ahead of the only non-Northwestern returning Tewarraton finalist James Madison’s Isabella Peterson (no. 4) as well as IWLCA Defender of The Year Sam Thacker (Denver no. 3) and IWLCA Goalie of The Year Delaney Sweitzer (Syracuse no. 5).  Obviously rankings are subjective (though putting anyone not named Scane at number one would have been an extremely questionable choice). But simply the idea that Northwestern has not just the best but the best TWO players is a scary thought for other teams. The reason why the Wildcats were able to win even if defenses double-teamed Scane was because of offensive threats like Coykendall who surrounded her and Coykendall’s ranking on this list emphasizes that stopping one Northwestern player won’t be enough to stop the whole team. White’s placement in the top ten is also noteworthy. She was named a second-team All-American by InsideLacrosse USA Lacrosse Magazine and the IWLCA and yet she ranked ahead of names like Maryland’s Meghan Ball (no. 9) North Carolina’s Emily Nalls (no. 11) Boston College’s Syndey Scales (no. 12) Notre Dame’s Casey Choma (no. 13) and Maryland’s Shaelyn Ahearn (no. 14) who were all named first-team All-Americans by at least one of the three aforementioned organizations (namely Ahearn and Scales who were InsideLacrosse first-team All-Americans).  These All-American awards came out before last season’s Final Four where White’s stock could have risen after her national championship performance that earned her player of the game but either way her placement was deserved. After being moved from the midfielder to the defender position during the third match of last season White has been critical for the Wildcats in the draw circle and on defense leading her team in caused turnovers (31) and ground balls (42). She also has a lot of speed and is lethal in transition oftentimes being the catalyst for offensive momentum. In other words her value had always been there it’s just that now it’s being recognized more. Taylor and Smith’s presence in these rankings also speaks to their significance for their team. Taylor who ranked third in goals amongst Northwestern players is coming off a season where she was arguably the best freshman attacker in the nation. She’s expected to have an elevated role for the Wildcats due to the departure of attacker Hailey Rhatigan and has already shown a lot of promise this fall scoring three goals against her college team during the Team USA U-20 squad’s fall ball showcase against Northwestern. Smith will likely continue her role as the Wildcats’ main woman in the draw circle. Draw controls were an important part of Northwestern’s national championship win last season as the team outperformed Boston College 17-8 in that category. Notably Smith was responsible for eight of those 17 draw controls. Once again rankings don’t dictate future success. In addition several important Northwestern players weren’t recognized by InsideLacrosse and there could be several more who emerge this coming season. Yet it’s always good to know who the media has its eyes on with rankings like these setting the stage for the narratives that come out of the new season. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story While NU prepares for their showdown in Las Vegas the pro ‘Cats are gearing up for a playoff push. Let’s take a look at how these former Wildcats fared across the NFL. Greg Newsome II: Cleveland Browns CB Newsome had a career-best game in the Browns’ 31-27 win at home against the Jaguars. In addition to five solo tackles and a career-high four pass deflections the third-year corner snagged his second interception of the season. In the fourth quarter Trevor Lawrence lofted a pass down the sideline to Calvin Ridley Newsome read the route the entire way and made a diving grab picking Lawrence off for his third INT of the game.  As the year goes on Newsome continues to prove why he was drafted in the first round in 2021. He has been the heart and soul of the Browns’ secondary spurring them on with his infectious energy and penchant for celebrating splash plays. Cleveland now sits at 8-5 good for second in their division and fifth in the AFC playoff picture. Their postseason hopes will likely hinge on 38-year-old Joe Flacco’s play at quarterback but Newsome will do the best he can to lead the defense to victory. Week 15 matchup: vs. Chicago Bears (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Rashawn Slater: Los Angeles Chargers OT Slater didn’t have one of his better games in Los Angeles’ 24-7 loss to the Broncos. Despite finishing with the offense’s third-best PFF grade (79.2) he allowed his second sack of the season. It was another rough result for the Chargers as they are now tied with the Raiders for last in the AFC West with a record of 5-8.  Slater will likely be protecting Easton Stick for the rest of the year as Justin Herbert left the game with a fractured index finger on his throwing hand. The third-year tackle will continue to produce but his team should be looking ahead to next season already. Week 15 matchup: at Las Vegas Raiders (Thursday 7:15 p.m. CT) Peter Skoronski: Tennessee Titans OG Skoronski added another solid performance to his rookie campaign in the Titans’ 28-27 win over the Dolphins. He played all 71 offensive snaps bolstering a line that surrendered just one sack all game. Skoronski’s protection was vital to Will Levis’ second-half success as the quarterback went 14 of 22 for 200 yards and a passing touchdown in that span.  Despite their electrifying Monday night win the Titans still sit at 5-8 good for last in the AFC South. Their hopes for the playoffs might be dashed but Skoronski will look to finish an excellent rookie season with a strong few weeks.  Week 15 matchup: vs. Houston Texans (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Ben Skowronek: Los Angeles Rams WR Skowronek didn’t record any receiving statistics in the Rams’ 37-31 loss to the Ravens in overtime. He played just six offensive snaps and his most eventful play was getting leveled on a block by linebacker Patrick Queen. However he did make two solo tackles while playing 30 special teams snaps.  In the first quarter Skowronek pushed Devin Duvernay out of bounds on a punt return. His second takedown came in the final frame when he tackled Tylan Wallace at Baltimore’s 28-yard line again as a gunner on the punt team. It’s clear that Skowronek hasn’t been in the Rams’ offensive plans this season but he’ll continue to contribute in any way he can. Week 15 matchup: vs. Washington Commanders (Sunday 3:05 p.m. CT) Anthony Walker Jr.: Cleveland Browns LB Walker played a vital role in the Browns’ unexpected win against Jacksonville. He recorded five combined tackles (three solo) on 52 defensive snaps and forced a fumble for the Jaguars’ third turnover on the day. In the third quarter Walker grabbed receiver Parker Washington and ripped the ball from his arms. He immediately fell on it to give the Browns possession on Jacksonville’s 22-yard line setting up a touchdown on the other end to put his team up 21-7.  All in all Walker finished with a PFF grade of 81.9 which was fifth-best on Cleveland’s defensive unit. It’s been a great two weeks for the linebacker who was nominated for the prestigious Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award last Tuesday. Week 15 matchup: vs. Chicago Bears (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Adetomiwa Adebawore: Indianapolis Colts DE Adebawore went backward in the Colts’ 34-14 loss to the Bengals but it wasn’t his fault. The rookie lineman’s only statistical contribution was a solo tackle because he played just five defensive snaps and six special teams snaps. In the third quarter he pushed Ja’Marr Chase out of bounds and allowed just one yard.  In his last five games Adebawore has seen the field for just 30% of Indianapolis’ defensive snaps on average. He’s still managed to get on the stat sheet in every one of those appearances. Drafted in the fourth round in April Adebawore is an unfinished product but has plenty of potential that he’ll look to flaunt against the Steelers on Saturday. Week 15 matchup: vs. Pittsburgh Steelers (Saturday 3:30 p.m. CT) Blake Hance: Jacksonville Jaguars OL Hance had a rough showing in the Jaguars’ 31-27 loss to Cleveland to say the least. He was thrust into action following an injury to second-string tackle Ezra Cleveland and he surrendered a whopping eight pressures in 52 snaps. With that being said he had to guard All-Pro edge rusher Myles Garrett for most of the game. That’s a tall task for an undrafted lineman whose natural position is guard not tackle. Despite his valiant effort Hance finished with a PFF grade of 18.3 including a pass-blocking grade of 0.0. Yikes. On Sunday night the wily veteran will look to keep a physical edge that prompted Garrett to complain about a missed holding call. Week 15 matchup: vs. Baltimore Ravens (Sunday 7:20 p.m. CT) Cameron Mitchell: Cleveland Browns CB Mitchell returned to the Browns’ secondary after missing the last four weeks with a hamstring injury. The rookie recorded two combined tackles (one solo) and deflected a pass in his second start of the season. On a crucial fourth-quarter possession for the Jaguars Mitchell batted a throw intended for Evan Engram. That deflection would turn into a turnover on downs for Jacksonville helping the Browns secure the win at home. It’s no small feat for a rookie corner to return from injured reserve and excel while playing a career-high 57 defensive snaps. But Mitchell was up to the task and he’ll be vital to Cleveland’s defense for as long as Denzel Ward continues to miss time. Week 15 matchup: vs. Chicago Bears (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Godwin Igwebuike: Pittsburgh Steelers RB Igwebuike made some important contributions in the Steelers’ 21-18 loss to New England. He started Pittsburgh’s first drive with a 27-yard return setting the offense up for an eventual field goal. To begin the second half he took Chad Ryland’s kickoff to the 17-yard line. The veteran back also showed off his acting skills in the second quarter flopping to the ground after making contact with Patriots special teamer Brenden Schooler. Igwebuike drew a flag that pushed New England back to their 11-yard line prompting a punt a few plays later. He’ll look to contribute to Pittsburgh’s playoff push in Indianapolis on Saturday afternoon. Week 15 matchup: at Indianapolis Colts (Saturday 3:30 p.m. CT) ‘Cats that didn’t play this week: Trevor Siemian (New York Jets) Joseph Jones (Tennessee Titans) Dean Lowry (Minnesota Vikings torn pectoral) Tyler Lancaster (Denver Broncos) Earnest Brown IV (Los Angeles Rams) Evan Hull (Indianapolis Colts torn meniscus) Ifeadi Odenigbo (New York Jets injured reserve) Joe Gaziano (Atlanta Falcons) \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Coming off a win against Illinois to close the regular season Northwestern has had some time to rest and reset before their battle against Utah. The Utes have lost two of their last three games; however the games were against Washington and Arizona. Washington is currently ranked second and Arizona is 14th in the country. Northwestern will look to win their first bowl game since 2021 and cap off a remarkable 2023. \nNorthwestern’s third down offense vs. Utah’s defense  This year Northwestern is ranked 52nd in the country converting 41.4% of its third downs. While this is a solid rate the ‘Cats will be tested against Utah. The Utes are the eighth best defensive team in the country on third down. They have allowed opposing teams to convert 28.9% of the time. It will be important for Northwestern to sustain drives.  However Utah might be shorthanded in the secondary against the ‘Cats. Cole Bishop and Sione Vaki declared for the NFL Draft. Bishop finished second on the team with 60 tackles and is ranked as the seventh-best safety on Mel Kiper’s big board. He has also added three sacks and two interceptions this year. Alongside Bishop Vaki is also a great player for Utah. He’s mainly a safety but has contributed on the other side of the ball as a running back. As a safety Vaki is fourth on the team with 50 tackles and has two sacks this year. Utah has a great third-down defense but if Bishop and Vaki don’t play third-down will be a much easier task for Northwestern. Northwestern’s depth vs. Utah’s depth The transfer portal will play a key role in Northwestern’s bowl game. Offensive guard Josh Priebe entered the transfer portal. He would be a major loss for Northwestern if he ends up leaving before the bowl game as he has been the team’s best offensive lineman this year. Outside of Priebe Northwestern has only had three others enter the portal none who are crucial to the team this year. On the other hand Utah has seen a mass exodus since the end of the regular season. It had three key players declare for the NFL draft (Devaughn Vele Cole Bishop and Sione Vaki) and 13 players have entered the transfer portal. Of those players many of them have played large roles this season. Last year’s starting quarterback Cam Rising has been out for the year and this year’s starter Bryson Barnes is in the portal; however he will play against the ‘Cats. The backup to Barnes is quarterback Nate Johnson who is also transferring.  JaTravis Broughton a cornerstone in the secondary for five years and first-year Mikey Matthews are in the portal. Matthews was a four-star wide receiver out of California and has been an important pass catcher this year finishing third on the team in receiving yards. With the Utes having loads of talent either declaring for the draft or in the transfer portal it is likely that the Wildcats will not see them across the line of scrimmage in Las Vegas.   Northwestern’s linebackers vs. Ja’Quinden Jackson and Bryson Barnes ""Ja’Quinden Jackson leads Utah with 742 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns this season. Although Jackson was a quarterback last year he has been a full-time running back this year and has been the bell-cow for the Utes averaging a solid 4.8 yards per carry on the year. He has hit triple digits in three games in 2023 highlighted by a 129-yard game against Baylor. While he can move the ball on the ground Jackson only has nine catches for 53 yards this season so the ‘Cats wont need to worry about him in the passing attack."" Quarterback Bryson Barnes is also a rushing weapon for the Utes. He is Utah’s third-leading rusher this season with 267 yards. In his last game against Arizona Barnes took off 19 times displaying his ability to churn out yards with his legs. His best rushing game of the season was against USC where he had 10 carries for 57 yards and a touchdown. While Barnes has only rushed for 3.6 yards per carry sacks contribute to rushing yards in college. Barnes is a better ball carrier than his stats show and Northwestern will have to do their best to contain him.  Even though Northwestern will have a tough task in limiting the running game the linebacker position is one of the strengths of the team.

Share this story For the first time since February Northwestern is back in the AP Top 25 Men’s College Basketball Poll. After beating No. 1 Purdue to start the month the ‘Cats received 77 points in the Dec. 4 AP Poll. With a win against Detroit Mercy and teams like Texas A&M San Diego State and Ohio State suffering losses NU vaulted to the No. 25 spot in this week’s rankings. But the AP Poll is flawed as voters tend to give boosts to big name teams and rely too heavily on the previous week’s rankings. In the early weeks of the season preseason expectations play a factor too — just look at Michigan State which after starting the year at No. 4 have plummeted to a 4-5 record. This creates a ranking that’s slightly behind reality letting expectations storylines and personal preference dictate a nationally accepted poll. In no way is this a bash against the AP Poll but it’s essentially a futile midpoint between a glorified power ranking and ranking the best 25 teams in the country. So what about rankings like KenPom RPI and the NET?  KenPom’s ranking uses an algorithm to measure teams’ adjusted efficiency margin using elements like strength of schedule to rank teams based on how efficient they are. On KenPom’s rankings Northwestern sits at No. 41 — above Big Ten schools like Michigan Iowa and Nebraska but below Purdue Wisconsin Illinois Ohio State and Michigan State.  More interestingly Northwestern ranks at No. 40 in adjusted offensive efficiency (points scored per 100 possessions adjusted for opponent) but No. 70 in adjusted defensive efficiency (points allowed per 100 possessions adjusted for opponent) with the great equalizer being Northwestern’s No. 341 ranking in adjusted tempo out of 362 Division I programs. Although fans might think of Northwestern as a defensive minded team stats available like this on KenPom indicate that Northwestern’s glacial pace might subtly strengthen their defensive effort over band-aiding a lack of perceived offense. Every Northwestern fan should love the RPI ranking which has Northwestern at No. 22. The RPI uses a mechanism that includes a team’s winning percentage average opponent’s winning percentage and the average opponent’s opponent’s winning percentage. After beating Purdue — which has already beaten Gonzaga Tennessee and Marquette this season — Northwestern saw its ranking as high as No. 3 but beating Detroit Mercy on Sunday caused the ‘Cats to tumble down to No. 20 on Monday as the Titans haven’t found the win column yet. The RPI is great for elevating good basketball teams that fly under the radar of heavy national attention. Especially early in the season the RPI’s dependency on a large sample size to accurately rank teams leads to questionable results. For example Memphis ranks at No. 7 Grand Canyon at No. 12 and Drake at No. 19. All are capable programs but none of them have any business as top-20 basketball teams. The RPI’s reliance on lots of data causes results that progressively become more precise as the season progresses. For now however it is ineffective. The NET system part of the NCAA formula to select March Madness teams focuses on game results. It balances strength of schedule game location how much teams win or lose to their opponents by as well as the quality of wins and losses. Northwestern sits at No. 48 in the NET going 1-1 in Quad 1 games (beating Purdue and losing to Mississippi State) 1-0 in Quad 2 games (beating Dayton) 1-0 in Quad 3 games (beating Rhode Island) and 4-0 in Quad 4 games (beating Binghamton Western Michigan NIU and Detroit Mercy).  The biggest reason Northwestern ranks so low is the fact it hasn’t played many highly ranked opponents which is crucial to success in the NET rankings and could play a key factor with potential March Madness seeding if Northwestern can get back to the tournament. Even though Texas A&M lost to Memphis on Sunday the Aggies sit at No. 23 thanks to a 3-3 record in six combined Quad 1 and 2 games. Although there’s a discussion to be had regarding if Texas A&M or Northwestern is better it’s certainly not by the large margin suggested by the NET. The best example is Indiana State’s No. 13 ranking in the NET due to a perfect 4-0 record against Quad 2 competition. If you can find any expert analyst or college basketball fan that thinks Indiana State even with a 9-1 record should be ranked higher than Northwestern please let me know. No disrespect to Indiana State who powered by Robbie Avila — a.k.a. college Jokic — will continue to make noise in the MVC this season but the Sycamores don’t have an All-American type point guard that dropped 31 points against the best team in the country 12 days ago. So the AP Poll is problematic KenPom has its pitfalls and the RPI and NET systems fall short. Math and algorithms are important tools to determine team rankings but there’s no perfect procedure.  So where should Northwestern rank? Paired with the eye test of watching every minute of Northwestern basketball this season and the numbers of KenPom RPI and the NET the ‘Cats are a top-35 basketball team in the country. They’re dynamic with their playmakers have the size and versatility to match up against anyone as well as the defensive core to support a surprisingly efficient offense. More importantly NU is good enough to compete with anyone — and after beating Purdue potentially good enough to even win against anyone — but shouldn’t necessarily be favored against a slew of power conference teams.  Rankings don’t matter. They don’t dictate wins or losses but are merely indicators of what should happen. However if what should happen was the only outcome there wouldn’t be upsets there wouldn’t be drama and there wouldn’t be college basketball.  So celebrate Northwestern’s No. 25 ranking in this week’s AP Poll with a sense of modesty. It’s a great look for a program on the rise but as long as the ‘Cats keep winning their ranking in the AP Poll KenPom RPI and the NET won’t make the slightest difference — until March when college basketball uses imperfect methods to determine a field of 68.  For now let’s not get ahead of ourselves. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Northwestern is taking on Utah in this year’s SRS Distribution Las Vegas Bowl on Dec. 23 but before we preview that game it’s fitting that we go back to the last time the Wildcats faced the Utes at the 2018 Holiday Bowl in San Diego. 2018 was a successful year for both teams. For Kyle Whittingham’s squad the team’s six conference wins were enough to give the 17th-ranked team a berth in that year’s PAC-12 Championship Game in a rematch from earlier in the season against No. 11 Washington.  However Utah couldn’t avenge its 21-7 September home loss to the Huskies this time seeing its offense go stagnant in a 10-3 loss. The Utes stayed ranked at No. 17 and were invited to play in the Holiday Bowl. Coming off a 10-3 season in 2017 in which the Wildcats finished second in the Big Ten West Northwestern found itself overcoming a three-game losing streak to end up finishing the regular season with an 8-4 overall record but an 8-1 conference mark. That was good enough to earn them a trip to Indianapolis to face off against Ohio State in the 2018 Big Ten Championship. However like Utah Northwestern couldn’t earn a Rose Bowl invitation with a win over its conference opponent falling to Ohio State 45-24. Heading into the game Utah was favored in the contest by seven points. However a cold hard rain in a usually pleasant (if not warm) San Diego might have given the announced audience of 47007 and the teams a feeling that this wouldn’t be a simple football game. Northwestern’s offense was ineffective in the first half. The team’s first drive did get the ball to Utah’s 38-yard line but then the team decided to punt to down Utah at the 4-yard line. Besides that drive and an eight-play 62-yard possession to set up a field goal score in the second quarter the Wildcats’ offense did nothing. The team had two three-and-outs Clayton Thorson threw an interception in the team’s territory and the ‘Cats turned the ball over after a failed fourth-and-1 conversion. Meanwhile Utah had early success scoring two touchdowns in three possessions in the first quarter and then adding on two field goals before halftime. Despite a fumble on the first play of their first drive to start the second quarter the Utes committed only two penalties and were able to head into their locker room up 20-3. Then-Northwestern head coach Pat Fitzgerald was quoted postgame that the team “talked at halftime about ‘Get a stop get a score seize momentum.’”  In the third quarter Northwestern’s defense took Fitzgerald’s message to heart forcing three turnovers and four total turnovers in the second half fueling Northwestern to a 28-0 run. Blake Gallagher picked off Utah quarterback Jason Shelley on the first possession of the third quarter. Thorson would then find receiver Ramaud Chiaokhiao-Bowman for a 52-yard completion and later Riley Lees for a four-yard touchdown pass to cut the lead to 20-10. After three-and-outs by both teams Utah drove down to the Northwestern 6-yard line before Jared McGee recovered a Utah fumble and ran it back 82 yards for an NU touchdown making the contest a one-score game at 20-17. Unfortunately for the Utes the rain must have gotten the best of them since on the third play of the next drive Utah fumbled again — this time recovered by JR Pace. Two plays later Thorson found Trey Klock for a 20-yard touchdown completion to take a 24-20 lead. Northwestern’s defense didn’t stop there as it halted Utah’s offense to another three-and-out on its next drive. The ‘Cats went on to drive down the field going 67 yards on six plays and scoring what would go down as the final score of the game with a Lees eight-yard touchdown run to grow the lead to 31-20. After NU’s touchdown drive the Wildcats’ defense got to work again picking off Shelley for a second time courtesy of Pace. Although Northwestern wouldn’t score for the rest of the game its defense caused another fumble another three-and-out a turnover on downs and held the Utes to 18 yards on their final drive to end the game. Utah generated nearly 400 yards of offense outgaining Northwestern in passing and rushing yardage but the ‘Cats’ defense forcing six turnovers was the tale of this game. “That was sweet because I think [the rain] played a really big factor” Fitzgerald said. “It was raining a bit harder coming out of halftime than it was before the half and I think that played a role in the game.” Thorson became the program’s all-time leading passer for Northwestern with 10731 career yards going 21-for-30 for 241 yards with two touchdowns and an interception in this one — earning him MVP honors for the game. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Welcome back to the film room everybody. After a brief hiatus for finals week I have returned for the penultimate edition of Bryant’s Bombs and this week we are talking HAT. It was a barnburner in Champaign with the ‘Cats holding off the Illini for a 45-43 victory the most points ever scored between the two squads. In the final Big Ten West game the matchup featured over 800 yards of total offense a perfect homage to the division. For the Wildcats Ben Bryant was under center for the third week in a row and led the offense to 38 points the most in 2023. While it is a few weeks late and Northwestern has turned its attention to Utes we’re going to rewind to Thanksgiving weekend and evaluate how the ‘Cats’ gunslinger performed. The Stats Bryant closed out the regular season 24-for-32 for 234 yards and two touchdowns and he added another score with his legs. However the sixth-year tossed two interceptions and both turned into points for the Illini. In his final regular season game Bryant’s yards per attempt dropped slightly from 9.2 against Purdue coming in at 7.3 against Illinois. Despite the two costly mistakes PFF awarded No. 2 an 83.5 passing grade the highest by a QB in purple and white in a full game since Peyton Ramsey in the 2021 Citrus Bowl. Furthermore PFF determined that the veteran had two big-time throws (a pass with excellent ball location and timing generally thrown further down the field and/or into a tighter window) yet his two turnover-worthy plays found the hands of the defenders. The ‘Cats’ signal-caller had some of the best protection of the season against the Fighting Illini sitting a clean pocket on 75% of dropbacks. When kept upright Bryant was 21-for-25 for 207 yards two touchdowns and an interception. Even when the Fighting Illini brought a blitz the grad transfer was very efficient completing two-thirds of pass attempts against the extra pass rusher. Also No. 2 attacked down the field. Over 50% of his passes were 10+ yards deep and he found his target on 11 of the passes. As always here is a complete breakdown of Bryant’s passes. While the numbers paint a strong picture the tape will show the full story. So without further ado let’s dive into the tape. The Good There were a lot of positives from Bryant’s performance in Champaign. For the majority of his throws he was on time and in rhythm moving the ball up and down the field. While we can consider the entire game a stock-up we’ll take a look at what specifically stood out. I know what you’re thinking: you’re highlighting Bryant as a runner? I was surprised too but when I watched the tape I could not have been more impressed with Bryant’s internal clock and escaping the pocket. This is a veteran quarterback taking advantage of what the defense gives him. The Illini bring six on a blitz and play man coverage behind it. Because the Wildcats have five receivers running routes every defender is keyed in on their target not paying attention to the QB. When Tre Tyus runs his check-down route out of the backfield it pulls the middle linebacker with him to the sideline vacating the middle of the field. The sixth-year realizes that no one is paying attention to him so he finds the hole in the pocket and jets off for a 17-yard gain. You can see that as soon as he stepped up in the pocket the veteran tucked the ball and took off recognizing that there was nothing but green grass in front of him.  Same concept only this time it goes for a score. Illinois brings an extra pass rusher and plays man coverage behind it. NU calls a five-man concept including multiple crossers to try and set natural picks for an easy score. Instead because the crossers get outside the hashes and Thomas Gordon draws the middle linebacker to the numbers the middle of the field is vacated once again. While No. 2 could step up and reset his feet he sees paydirt in front of him and scampers in for the easy touchdown. I also want to point out that in both of these clips Bryant escapes through the front of the pocket guaranteeing positive yards no matter what. I have talked at length this season about Bryant’s ability to get through a progression and make the right read and these plays are a perfect example of this strength. Scrambling is the right read even if it knocks down his passing stats. In a similar vein to our last topic Bryant gets through his progression quickly and keeps defenders on his heels. This may be one of my favorite throws from the entire season. Once again the Fighting Illini play man coverage across the board. Directly after the snap the ‘Cats’ QB looks to the far side of the field moving the one-high safety following Bryant’s eyes to the right. Once the grad transfer realizes he has the safety moved watch him whip his head to the other side of the field. Snap. By the time the safety can break and turn to the other side of the field Cam Johnson has already beaten and stacked his defender and Bryant drops one in the bucket for a huge gain. It is a game of cat and mouse between the quarterback and the free safety and this time the quarterback baited it perfectly. There is no chance for the safety to disrupt the play because Bryant fully took him out of it making it a game of pitch and catch for the pair of sixth years. The Bad While there was a lot of good Bryant made the game closer than it should have been a few times. Yes you all know what this topic is going to be. This is an area Bryant usually thrived in this season. Since Week One’s debacle in New Jersey Bryant had only turned the ball over two times the rest of the season. However he made two costly mistakes against Illinois. ""First of all I hate the play call from Mike Bajakian. Cam Porter just ripped off a massive run you are inside six minutes and you call four verticals? This is not a good decision either from Bryant who gets drilled as he lets go of the ball. Kirtz is covered the entire way with the defender in phase the whole time. Unless this ball is perfect hitting Kirtz over his far shoulder this is a 50/50 ball at best. Because of the hit Bryant could not get enough on it and the 50/50 ball turned into a 100% interception Kirtz had to try to come back and play defense but the ball landed right in the corners lap. Luckily for the QB the defense bailed him out with an interception of its own."" Tips and overthrows a defense’s best friend. I don’t hate the read but No. 2 just airmails it into the awaiting arms of the free safety who goes untouched for a pick-six. A.J. Henning has a little bit of separation so Bryant is trying to lead him outside but he never sees the safety ranging over and leaves it inside enough for the interception. His footwork is clean he just put too much mustard on the throw. To the grad transfer’s credit he quickly recuperated and led NU down the field to retake the lead before the half. However instead of it being a 15-point Northwestern lead after the next two drives (the Wildcats scored on the first drive after halftime) it was still a one-score game because Bryant gifted the Illini a free seven points. Final Thoughts Bryant played a solid game overall but his few mistakes were costly. At the end of the day he did enough to help the Wildcats recapture the HAT and bring it back to Evanston. In his final college football game he will face a much taller task in a stout Utah defense but ‘Cats fans should be thankful that when it counted the most this season Bryant was ready for the challenge. NU would not be 7-5 if Bryant did not wear purple and white this season. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Coming into Wednesday night what if I told you that: Any rational fan would’ve expected a cruise-control win for the Wildcats. Yet the team’s ninth game of the season against Chicago State proved anything but. Instead of dominating a much weaker opponent the ‘Cats made a cavalcade of mistakes plus had zero answers for Wesley Cardet Jr. — who notched a gaudy 30 points on 13-for-21 shooting. For one turnovers plagued NU the entire evening. Chris Collins’ squad amassed 14 of them with the Cougars racking up 13 steals. That mark was the most by the Wildcats so far this season and a rather shocking performance given that the team paces the entire Big Ten in turnover margin averaging 8.6 per game even after yesterday. Most frustratingly such giveaways seemed the byproduct of sloppy and/or lackadaisical basketball: look no further than Nick Martinelli’s pass being knocked away (and then dunked) by Noble Crawford or Ty Berry dribbling out of bounds off the inbound with only 3:52 remaining. On the note of Berry the senior regressed in a big way after buoying Northwestern over the last few games. No. 3 scored just three points making one of seven shots (and one of five from deep) on a miraculous last-second bank heave. On top of that he had three turnovers and four fouls. As two of the team’s last three games (vs. No. 1 Purdue/Chicago State) have indicated Berry is pretty instrumental to Northwestern’s success both in single-contest outcomes and over the course of a full year. Moreover the ‘Cats shot only 65% from the free throw line which actually marked the third game of having that mark or lower from the stripe. Barnhizer particularly struggled from the line going 3-for-6 but a miss from Matthew Nicholson on a would-be and-one was costly with the team trailing 65-63. Collectively it’s not hard to see why all of those ingredients can brew up a trap game loss for the No. 25 team in the nation. What’s most alarming however is the phenomenon of not seizing momentum throughout the course of the game. Following a slam by Nicholson the Wildcats led the Cougars 33-25 with 4:09 left in the first half; it seemed as if there was sufficient breathing room and that Northwestern was in a relatively sound spot. Instead CSU enjoyed a 10-0 run including eight points single-handedly coming from Jahsean Corbett. That left tension in Welsh-Ryan Arena as NU sleepwalked through the end of the first half. To start the second period things didn’t turn around much to begin with the ‘Cats making one of their first five shots and losing by seven nearly four minutes in. However the team found the bottom of the rim much more efficiently from there racing to a 60-52 advantage after a strong layup by Barnhizer and two free throws from Nick Martinelli. With only 8:52 left it finally seemed as if the Wildcats could ease off the gas pedal. As they demonstrated the entire night though the Cougars had one more roar left. CSU exploded to the tune of another 10-0 run and Cardet became a one-man wrecking crew by weaving for a layup and drilling a three over Nicholson to give Chicago State a 70-67 lead — one it wouldn’t relinquish for the rest of the game. To have a 3-9 team go on those types of stretches multiple times in a matchup is bad enough. But what’s more frightening is that long lapses have become commonplace for Northwestern which has routinely played down to competition. The season opener against Binghamton didn’t look radically different with NU trailing 39-36 at halftime. The team’s affair against Western Michigan was also significantly closer than anticipated in part because the Broncos went on an 8-0 run in the middle of the second half. Play from Uncasville Connecticut revealed much of the same with the ‘Cats in full throttle to start but then yielding enormous advantages to both Rhode Island and Mississippi State. Hell even the win against the Boilermakers didn’t come without extra anxiety: Zach Edey was able to tie the game in the final seconds of regulation after a dramatic floater by Buie and even with a 90-86 lead in OT Braden Smith notched two quick free throws that made things tighter than necessary. Frankly no team is perfectly unblemished especially this early into a season lasting at least five months. Then again the idea of Northwestern not capitalizing on momentum and letting opponents stay alive is one that’s already reared its ugly head more than it should. Despite the ‘Cats becoming fodder for jokes (if not astonished looks at box scores) around the college basketball landscape Wednesday and Thursday it’s not as if all hope is lost. The team has 22 games remaining and is still 1-0 against conference competition. For as devastating as this defeat felt against Chicago State it very plausibly may become an afterthought if Collins’ team can post major wins over top competition; likewise it probably wouldn’t be the only reason if Northwestern were to miss the NCAA Tournament. At the same time the urgency is starting to mount for the Wildcats even on Dec. 14. For one this caliber of a loss can’t happen again — in 2023-24 or for the remainder of Collins’ newly extended tenure. More immediately it’s a wake-up call for a team that desperately needs to avoid long stretches of bad basketball that awaken opponents and which will need to better stack big shots and plays in key moments as a relentless Big Ten slate approaches. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Another volleyball season has come and gone for the Wildcats and it was another season with a lot of meat left on the bone.  Losing nearly half of its roster in the offseason including All-American Temi Thomas-Ailara Northwestern brought in seven new faces including five transfers to replenish its roster. In an up-and-down season the ‘Cats went on to finish 15-15. However their 9-11 Big Ten record was the best in former head coach Shane Davis’s eight years at the helm of the program and NU’s most conference wins since 2010. Despite inching closer to a winning Big Ten record Northwestern parted ways with Davis after the season. In a statement on Dec. 1 athletic director Derrick Gragg said “based on the performance of the program during his tenure it is time for a change in leadership.”  However I’d be remiss not to mention that Davis was named in a lawsuit against NU back in July which alleged he partook in the hazing of a former player. Inside NU subsequently learned more information about the incident including an unannounced suspension for the remainder of the 2020-2021 COVID season. After these allegations were made public Davis pulled out of Big Ten Media Day sending assistant coach Pedro Mendes in his place.  It was not all negative for the Wildcats. Graduate student Julia Sangiacomo a transfer from Santa Clara earned First-Team All-Big Ten Honors marking the fourth-straight year a Wildcat has earned the honor. Despite missing some time with a knee injury Sangiacomo finished her lone season in Evanston with 380 kills which placed her in the conference’s top 10. Alexa Rousseau added another 1061 assists to her career moving her into sixth all-time in program history.  This season also saw the emergence of younger ‘Cats. Sophomores Kennedy Hill and Averie Hernandez became household names in Evanston posting strong performances in expanded roles. Hill splitting time with Leilani Dodson at the middle blocker spot had 106 total blocks on the year and added 124 kills on the offensive end. Hernandez who didn’t see the floor consistently until midway through conference play  still finished third on the ‘Cats with 217 kills No. 8 had 14 games of double-digit kills while also adding 22 aces from behind the service line. With Kathryn Randorf who made the Big Ten’s All-Freshman Team in 2022 and Sienna Noordermeer who redshirted this season after making an impact as a setter in 2022 the ‘Cats have a strong class of sophomores to lead this program into a new era. Despite the influx of talent Northwestern struggled to play clean matches. Even going back to the first game of the season the Wildcats had Hawaii on the ropes but 51 errors in the match allowed the Rainbow Warriors to swoop in and snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Once back on the mainland the ‘Cats picked up a victory in their first home match; however they were soundly defeated by UW-Milwaukee 3-1 just a few days later with 38 errors hurting NU throughout the contest. The same issues arose the next time Northwestern took the floor at Welsh-Ryan Arena. After soundly going up 2-0 on UIC the Wildcats were reverse-swept by the Flames losing 3-2. It was a loss that epitomized the problems for NU during the Davis era: mistakes compounding to allow opponents to go on massive runs.  Moving into Big Ten play the Wildcats got off to a rough start. NU was swept in back-to-back matchups to begin their conference season falling to No. 1 Wisconsin and No. 15 Penn State. When the top-ranked Badgers came into town Welsh Ryan was electric. Wildside packed out both sides of the student section making it feel more like a men’s basketball game than a volleyball match. The atmosphere did not help the play on the court though as the Badgers waltzed their way to victory. It did not get better for the ‘Cats who dropped to 0-3 after losing to Michigan State in five sets. On its first Big Ten road trip NU came away with its best win of the season. Traveling to West Lafayette Indiana The Wildcats faced off with the No. 17 Boilermakers. After falling behind 2-0 the Cardiac ‘Cats stormed back and rallied for three straight-set victories upsetting Purdue for the second year in a row. In the match Sangiacomo rattled off 33 kills good for second-most in a single game in program history. However after its best game of the year Northwestern followed it up with one of its worst performances in 2023. Heading to Ann Arbor the Wildcats took on a three-win Michigan team. While the sets were tightly contested the Wolverines held on for a 3-1 victory. In the match NU had 46 errors including eight receiving errors. It was a letdown game of all letdown games all but slamming the door shut on any chance the ‘Cats had at making a push for their first NCAA Tournament bid. Throughout the rest of the season NU traded victories and defeats weekly but closed the year out winning four of its last five. Yet by the time those victories occurred the writing was on the wall. The Wildcats finished under .500 in the Big Ten once again and fell short of their goal of making the postseason. As the curtain fell on the 2023 season it also did on Davis’ tenure at the helm of the program. After eight seasons Davis leaves Evanston with a 103-128 record but also a mere 45-105 mark in conference matches. With new leadership taking over the program the future of Northwestern volleyball is unknown. Make no mistake about it this team has the talent to be in the upper echelon of the Big Ten yet it has not consistently put it together. If the right coaching staff can come in and develop this young core properly the ‘Cats can make some noise in the immediate future. However if Gragg does not get this one right Northwestern will remain relegated to the bottom of the Big Ten. A new voice was needed but now it’s time to see if it can turn a historically average program into a tournament team. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1

Share this story A much-needed win.  Northwestern (4-7 0-1 B1G) snapped its six-game losing streak with an 86-66 victory over Bradley (4-6 0-0 MVC). Caleigh Walsh has a team-high 19 points for the ‘Cats with Caroline Lau and Paige Mott also chipping in 17 and 16 points. Defensively Melannie Daley notched five steals and three rebounds to compliment her 13-point performance. For Bradley Alex Rouse Reagan Barkema and Isis Fitch all scored 15 points.  Northwestern controlled the opening tip and Lau quickly found Daley for an open mid-range jumper to start the festivities. Bradley’s Rouse got to her spot on the first possession for the Braves hitting a jumper of her own to even the score.  It would take another two minutes before either side found any semblance of rhythm on offense. Daley flexed her defensive muscle for the ‘Cats with a block but a missed jumper and a turnover from Lau contributed to some early offensive struggles.  With 7:30 to play in the first quarter Barkema connected on a wide-open three to break the scoring drought. Barkema’s shooting proved to be contagious as Lau hit back-to-back triples to wake up Northwestern’s dormant offense.  After a flurry of back-and-forth basketball that saw the Braves take a 13-12 lead Caleigh Walsh finally checked in for the ‘Cats but the junior was unable to provide a spark for the home side. A pair of defensive lapses from Northwestern culminated in another wide-open look from deep for Barkema which she converted to widen the Braves’ lead to eight. Head coach Joe McKeown looked animated as he called a timeout.  The ‘Cats looked a lot more cohesive after the break with Lau feeding Walsh down low for a pair of tough layups. Northwestern was able to cut the deficit to five to close out the first quarter.  Walsh was able to carry that momentum into the second period putting up six points within the first three minutes to put Northwestern back in front 28-26. Daley kept the scoring going for the ‘Cats with two transition layups to help bolster the lead but NU continued to struggle defensively. Bradley’s Fitch sliced through the Northwestern zone to hit a layup and the senior hit a three on the ensuing possession to help the Braves retake the lead. The Wildcats responded to the Fitch triple by upping their defensive pressure employing a full-court press to force five turnovers in three minutes. Northwestern only turned one of those turnovers into points — an and-one layup in transition from Daley — but her acrobatics were enough to tie the score at 34.  Barkema broke the deadlock with her fourth three of the afternoon but the ‘Cats were not able to retake the lead before the half. Northwestern turned the ball over twice in the final two minutes of the second quarter and Bradley took a 39-38 lead into the break.  Barkema fired from deep on the first possession of the second half but blissfully for the ‘Cats her hot hand appeared to have cooled off at halftime. Northwestern controlled the action after the miss from the Braves’ sharpshooter.  The Wildcats found production from five different scorers as they dominated the first five minutes of the third quarter. Lau capped a furious 13-0 Northwestern run with two free throws and after a much-needed Bradley timeout NU led 55-42.  The Braves were able to cut into the Northwestern lead after the timeout buoyed by an open three from Ru Abo Hashesh but buckets down low from Lau Walsh and freshman forward Crystal Wang kept the ‘Cats firmly in front. Northwestern headed into the fourth with an 11-point advantage dominating the third quarter 27-15.  Abo Hashesh and Fitch brought Bradley back within seven in the first two minutes of the fourth quarter but Northwestern’s offense showed no signs of slowing down. Mott hit a tough layup and drew a foul on back-to-back possessions forcing the Braves to bring another forward into the paint to contain her. With more space around the perimeter Mott found Wang who connected on a rather wide-open three. That Wang triple extended Northwestern’s lead into double-digits once again but this time Bradley was not able to respond. Mott continued to bully the Braves in the post to the tune of seven points in the fourth quarter as the ‘Cats pulled away to earn a much-needed 20-point victory.  Northwestern will look to build off this momentum on Thursday when it takes on Temple in Philadelphia. Tip-off is set for 11 a.m. CT and the game will be streamed on Big Ten Plus. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story At long last bowl season has arrived. In only five days Northwestern will look to reach the eight-win threshold as it takes on Utah from Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas Nevada. Frankly the fact that the Utes got to 8-4 themselves and were ranked as high as No. 10 in the AP Poll is a testament to coaching particularly by lead man Kyle Whittingham and defensive coordinator Morgan Scalley. The team suffered a slew of injuries and lost a lot of talent relative to last year — mainly on offense with Dalton Kincaid and Tavion Thomas moving on to the next level. But many of the key pieces that allowed Utah success in 2023 likely will not suit up against the Wildcats. As of now 14 Utes are in the transfer portal while other stars either are injured or have declared for the 2024 NFL Draft. One of the major quagmires of bowl predictions is that one has little idea who will actually play so this analysis will assume that the vast majority of the players falling into those aforementioned categories will not strap up their pads in Sin City. Consequently what is NU getting in Utah from a personnel and structural standpoint? Take a deeper dive into all three facets of Whittingham’s squad below. Offense Although the Utes averaged 24.5 points per game their offense was certainly not as cohesive as in the past. According to College Football Data Utah had the third-worst offensive EPA/play in the PAC-12 including the fourth-worst rushing offense. Besides the loss of Kincaid the big reason why was injury. Star quarterback Cam Rising never played the entire year after suffering a catastrophic knee injury in the 2023 Rose Bowl making quarterback somewhat of a revolving door. QB Bryson Barnes Ultimately junior Barnes took the reins of the starting job under center. Across 10 games Barnes completed 58.5% of his passes for 12 touchdowns nine interceptions and a 123.6 rating. Pro Football Focus awarded him a 66.3 passing grade which was eighth in the PAC-12 among quarterbacks with a minimum of 250 dropbacks. Intriguingly enough Barnes is actively in the transfer portal but will still start for Utah. In terms of his throwing skill Barnes actually has several similarities to Ben Bryant. The junior has a relatively solid arm and generally displays solid pocket movement often trying to reset and extend plays — which can be a double-edged sword. This touchdown strike was strong work to step up between the tackles. Moreover Barnes has the ability to stand tall and throw despite taking shots. His physical frame (more on that in a second) can prove to be an asset in parrying contact. At 6-foot-1 209 pounds Barnes is a very willing and even physical runner though he’s not incredibly quick or elusive. Utah OC Andy Ludwig regularly implements Barnes’ legs whether through options or draws. Further Barnes isn’t afraid to take off and scamper if he doesn’t like what he sees in terms of coverage. Barnes’ biggest downfall is probably a bit of recklessness with the football. He can sometimes telegraph throws and/or not understand defenders’ positioning. Other times Barnes can want to create late in a play but that desperation can lead to takeaways. His 12 turnover-worthy plays were fifth among those previously described 11 PAC-12 QBs. Varied Run Game Initial Utah starting RB Micah Bernard — who posted 533 yards on five yards per carry last year — suffered what was thought to be a season-ending injury in the team’s opener against Florida. However the expectation is that Bernard will return to action in Las Vegas which muddies things for Northwestern’s defense. The Wildcats must have sound tackling form on Bernard who boasts good contact balance. In Bernard’s stead the Utes turned two a three-pronged attack with Ja’Quinden Jackson the lead horse. At 6-foot-2 228 pounds Jackson excels at getting downhill and by using his power to take on contact. Utah frequently ran him between the tackles especially in the A or B gaps. Altogether Jackson totaled 742 yards and four scores. Additionally Utah handed off to Jaylon Glover 121 times (as opposed to Jackson’s 153 carries). The 5-foot-8 Glover is certainly smaller in stature than Jackson but also considerably more elusive and quick. His ability to get east/west and juke out a defender is something David Braun’s defense will have to key in on. The elephant in the room for Ludwig in the pass and run game will be the absence of two-way stud Sione Vaki who amassed 520 scrimmage yards and a gaudy 9.8 yards/touch. Vaki declared for the 2024 Draft and his presence as a runner route runner and overall big playmaker will certainly alter Utah’s gameplan. New-Look Receiver Room The concept of changes has also afflicted the Utes’ receiver corps after the draft declaration of Devaughn Vele who posted 593 yards and a ludicrous 13.8 yards per catch. Moreover third option Mikey Matthews entered the portal. That leaves Money Parks as Barnes’ presumptive top target. The 5-foot-10 junior possesses relatively top-end speed and can get behind a defense (as he did against Florida in the clip below) though 45.8% of his targets came within 10 yards of the line of scrimmage per PFF. Parks had just 289 yards in part because of an 11.8% drop percentage. Other options to monitor in terms of pass-catchers include Munir McClain and TE Landen King. It is not expected that WR Mycah Pittman or tight ends Thomas Yassmin or Brant Kuithe who had their seasons halted by injury will suit up. Other Things to Know Even shifts have caused transition among Whittingham’s protectors. Starting right tackle Sataoa Laumea accepted an invite to the Senior Bowl and his status for Saturday is unclear. Moreover starting left guard Keaton Bills also declared for the draft. Utah could very well be down 2/5 of its typical OL which surrendered 135 pressures — the fourth-most in the PAC-12. Regarding scheme Ludwig isn’t afraid of interspersing some trickery whether in the form of Wildcat or even a double pass (which was often run with Vele). Beyond those wrinkles the ‘Cats have to hone in on play action where Barnes attempted 23.8% of his passes. Barnes’ ability to move also opens up boot action and if the Utes can find efficiency in the run game that makes PA that much more appealing. Defense Utah’s defense was largely its backbone for the 2023 season permitting just 19.8 points per game and ranking fifth in the conference in defensive EPA/play. Scalley is one of the more unheralded assistants in the sport; his ability to develop both top-end talent (e.g. Jaylon Johnson Devin Lloyd Julian Blackmon Cody Barton Clark Phillips III) and a cohesive unit is tremendously impressive. However Scalley’s defense will be a bit shorthanded against Northwestern. First-Team All-PAC-12 selection Jonah Elliss who racked up 12 sacks and 16 TFLs suffered a season-ending injury late in the year and does not appear to be ready to go. Further starting linebacker Lander Barton went down in October. In addition to those massive losses the Utes won’t have both starting safeties (Vaki and Cole Bishop) plus corner JaTravis Broughton. Who must step up for Whittingham with the top three defenders in snaps played (likely) out)? It starts with junior corner Zemaiah Vaughn who earned a 75.9 PFF grade on the season. The 6-foot-2 Vaughn is physical in coverage and a strong tackler in the open field though his three penalties were tied for the most on Utah’s defense. In the middle of that unit linebackers Karene Reid and Levani Damuni will need to carry the freight. Reid earned a Second Team All-PAC-12 nomination after posting 59 tackles 1.5 TFLs an interception a touchdown and four pass deflections while Damuni paced the Utes with 75 tackles and 33 stops. Reid missed an absurdly low 1.5% of his tackles all season which was the lowest among linebackers in the nation (min. 500 snaps). Even without their superstar edge rusher the Utes still have solid players in Connor O’Toole and Van Fillinger both of whom notched at least 19 pressures and 12 stops. Each carries strong motors and the ability to punch out the football something that Ben Bryant and NU’s offensive players should be wary of. In the back end look for safety Nate Ritchie to see increased playing time sans Vaki and Bishop. Ritchie has played only 154 snaps in 2023 — after not seeing the field since 2020 due to a mission — but was a four-star prospect and has good size at 6-foot-2. Defensive Tendencies Structurally Utah tends to run a 4-2-5 while dropping a safety into the box something with which is something Wildcat fans are familiar. Frequent coverages include Cover 2 and 6 which can leave the middle of the field beyond hook zones vulnerable. Colorado took advantage of that in the Utes’ final game of the regular season with star Travis Hunter finding the end zone on a dig. Scalley isn’t afraid to be aggressive either. Utah can turn to well-timed blitzes particularly up the middle through its middle linebackers. Offensive communication especially in terms of hot routes will be critical on such plays. Utah also hangs its hat on very sound tackling. The Utes had just 90 misses all season which was the second-fewest in the PAC-12. It’s not uncommon to see multiple players rally to the ball which is the hallmark of a good defense. Yet for as well as Utah’s defense generally performed this year there were definitely lapses against teams with potent offenses like Washington Oregon and USC. The Utes did surrender chunk runs at times due to poor angles and/or not shedding blocks well and also got gashed through the air on occasion with poor coverage or bad adjustments to the ball. A key stat to know: when Utah allowed more than 17 points the team went just 1-4. That might be the target number for the Wildcats if they want to prevail. Special Teams/Miscellaneous I’d be remiss if this thorough of a breakdown didn’t include specialists after all. Utah kicker Cole Becker had a phenomenal season converting all 27 of his extra points and going 15-for-18 on field goals. Interestingly enough two of his three misses were from 37 yards or shorter. Further Becker made three of four kicks from 40+ including one from 51 against the Gators. Punter Jack Bouwmeester was also outstanding netting First Team All-PAC-12 after averaging 46 yards per punt. The sophomore from Bendigo Australia was a Ray Guy Award semifinalist in part because he had 17 punts of 50+ yards. Take a look at his unreal showing against Florida which featured a 64 (!)-yard punt; Bouwmeester could be a major asset in terms of field position. Finally it shouldn’t be surprising to learn that Whittingham’s team is highly disciplined. The Utes averaged 42.6 penalty yards per game which was the lowest mark in the PAC-12 and 22nd nationally. For context Northwestern was 30th. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Everything went poorly for Northwestern in that game: Ty Berry couldn’t find his shot and the bench contributed almost nothing to the scoring effort. Additionally the ‘Cats coughed up an uncharacteristic 14 turnovers in the contest en route to the devastating upset. Northwestern stabilized on Saturday with a 56-46 victory at DePaul (2-8 0-0 Big East) but it still didn’t look like the team that beat Purdue two weeks ago. Here are some things we learned from the ‘Cats’ back-to-back games against intra-state opponents: Purdue Ty Berry is gone Berry was the man against the Boilermakers shooting 7-of-11 from the field for 21 points. He followed that up with another double-digit effort (this time 16) against Detroit Mercy. Things were looking up for the historically frustrating and inconsistent senior. I had some hope that maybe he had found his game for good. It appears he did not. Berry was anemic against Chicago St. hitting just one-of-seven from the floor and it was a chucked-up banked three. To follow it up He was then even worse against DePaul putting up a zero-burger.  The truth is when Ty Berry goes Northwestern goes. His play on any particular night is a major swing in the game. With an effective Berry pressure comes off of Boo Buie at the guard spot. He also lengthens out the lineup and gives Northwestern four upperclassmen in its starting five who are all capable scorers. Without Berry Buie is going to struggle more. Opposing defenses are going to be able to zone in on him more and be willing to let Berry have space. It also puts a lot of pressure on Brooks Barnhizer and Ryan Langborg to provide supplementary scoring to Buie every game. Northwestern needs Berry to return to form (again) if it wants to be the best version of itself. Nick Martinelli is a dude Martinelli’s performance against Detroit Mercy in which he set a career-best mark with 22 points certainly felt like a fluke to anyone who has watched much Nick Martinelli over the past two years. We had previously never seen anything close to that level of production out of the sophomore. Well now we’ve seen it twice after Martinelli shined again this week at DePaul. He once again paced the ‘Cats in scoring this time with 16 and was efficient from the floor shooting the ball at a 60% clip. Martinelli is interesting because while I think it’s silly to expect consistent double digits out of him his play recently is still exciting. If he can provide this spark say once every three games then that’s a bench piece I can really get behind. To his credit Martinelli looks less wild on the floor in every aspect of the game. It feels like he moves his feet better on defense. He definitely handles the ball with more poise and confidence. And his knack for putting the ball through the basket in questionable uncommon ways is as present as ever. Northwestern needs fans at Welsh Ryan Winter break started before the Chicago St. loss which meant Northwestern’s student section was virtually non-existent for the game. This was not ideal for a ‘Cats team that thrives in big moments with a rip-roaring crowd in the arena. The environment was lacking and Northwestern clearly couldn’t get itself going. This is no excuse for the loss. The loss was inexcusable and embarrassing. But I think it is important to at least factor in when evaluating why what happened happened. Northwestern will undeniably be better off when Big Ten play starts up in January and students are back on campus. The excitement surrounding this team despite the giant leap backward it took this week is significant. Students will pack the house when they get on campus and that will be a good thing for the on-court product. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

What does it mean? Share this story Over the past week Northwestern men’s basketball’s Christmas list of concerns got much longer. Consequently an item that’s been near the top of that list since early November — rebounding — has gotten a little blurry. Whether it got obscured from the larger-scale panic arising from an inexplicable loss Northwestern’s rebounding problem got clearer in its past two games. Against Chicago State and DePaul two teams that were getting outrebounded by over five boards per game prior to their tilts with NU the Wildcats lost the combined rebounding battle. With the heart of the Big Ten schedule looming it’s worth diving into those issues and how they’ve contributed to what is looking like an eerily unique identity for Northwestern.  First off how bad are these struggles really? The answer: it’s not great but it could be worse. When it comes to offensive rebounding percentage and allowed offensive rebounding percentage — which are better metrics than raw rebounding totals to evaluate slow-pace teams that tend to generate fewer possessions like Northwestern (more on that later) — the Wildcats rank outside of the nation’s top 220 teams. They’ve allowed opposing offenses to secure 31.2% of potential defensive rebounds. There happen to be 15 Power Six teams with a worse defensive rebounding percentage including three Big Ten teams (Penn State Rutgers and Maryland). That’s not horrible. However none of those teams have played an easier slate of games than Northwestern which has KenPom’s 284th-highest strength of schedule rating through Dec. 18. Of course even that mark is buoyed by NU’s lone conference game against No. 1 Purdue. Even worse nine of Northwestern’s 12 opponents on the docket before the new year (including Dayton and Arizona State) have defensive rebounding rates that fall outside of Division I’s top 220. Comparing this to Northwestern’s recent program history this is a little concerning. As stated above the Wildcats’ opposing offensive rebounding percentage in 2023-24 stands at 31.2% thus far (not shown here): Northwestern has already played six of the seven (currently) Quad 4 games on its schedule has 19 Big Ten games left and is already on pace for its worst defensive rebounding percentage since Bill Carmody roamed the sidelines. Not good!  It’s easy to attribute these struggles to Northwestern’s lack of a traditional power forward. After all you can see NU’s defensive rebounding success climb in seasons where Chris Collins deployed two-big lineups (Robbie Beran-Matt Nicholson Beran-Pete Nance). Yet although size is important it hasn’t proven to be the be-all and end-all for the ‘Cats. This is far from the first season where Collins has gone small. In fact Northwestern has gone multi-year stretches playing even smaller. Bart Torvik has a metric called effective height which weights the minute totals of a team’s frontcourt (effectively the average of the “tallest 40%” of its minutes). This season NU’s effective height sits at 6-foot-8 1⁄2  (not shown). It’s small but it doesn’t beat the Dererk Pardon era. The gray dots represent the Big Ten average which is currently at 81.1 inches this year: Even if you’re of the mindset that this metric doesn’t take the 2023-24 Wildcats’ lack of two-big lineups into enough account — which is totally fair — Northwestern’s average height weighted by total minutes (77.3 inches) is comparable to a season like 2021-22 when it rebounded well: While it’s true that Northwestern has tended to rebound better when it grew there’s seasons like 2019-20 when the Wildcats didn’t clean the glass at a great rate despite possessing significant size advantages across the board. Additionally Collins and Co. maintained respectable rebounding marks when they rolled with the 6-foot-8 Pardon — a terrific rebounder — at center for three straight seasons. On the 2016-17 squad not a single player that earned more than 10 minutes a game was taller than 6-foot-8.  Thus not having a true four makes a difference but as Collins has noted when he’s been asked about Northwestern’s struggles on the glass it’s not the primary root of the problem. The ‘Cats have won before with these issues and they did in 2016-17.  What’s unique about the rebounding struggles this season — and maybe worrisome — is that Northwestern is doing this at a pace that’s super slow even by its own standards. By nature a shorter perimeter-centric team tends to play at a faster pace. More possessions equals more shots which creates more opportunities to excel for a team that believes it can outshoot its opponents. Although small rebounding issues might hurt they won’t be fatal for a team if it can defend well and score at a significantly higher clip with lots of chances to prove itself.  An individual defensive rebounding opportunity means slightly less for a fast-paced team than it does for a slow-paced one like NU which seeks to limit the number of possessions in a game and has fewer chances to score. The fewer possessions in a game there are the more valuable each one becomes. It also makes preventing extra ones all the more important which is why Northwestern places such an onus on avoiding turnovers. As a result the Wildcats’ lapses down low are especially significant. As a team with four perimeter players standing 6-foot-6 or smaller in its starting five and the second-slowest adjusted tempo in the Power Six Northwestern is already weird. This is a little weirder: Northwestern hasn’t just struggled to grab defensive rebounds in pre-Big Ten play. It’s also done that while playing some of its slowest basketball in nearly a decade. And if the past few years mean anything its pace could slow even more come January. The Wildcats have surrendered 31.2% of their potential defensive rebounds while playing at an adjusted pace of 64.5 possessions per game through Dec. 18. This is incredibly unique. A grand total of one Power Six team since 2015-16 — 2023-24 Virginia — has had both a lower adjusted tempo and a higher opposing offensive rebounding percentage through that date. The rigors of conference play brought only four other teams past both of Northwestern’s marks over a full season since 2015-16. Here’s a quick look at those teams: That’s not exactly a recipe for success. It makes sense: a slower tempo without a dominant big makes it harder to generate efficient offense which makes it even tougher to defeat good teams that can break down almost any defense. The two NCAA Tournament-bound teams in that group have elite quick and versatile defenses while Northwestern’s has not looked the part without Chase Audige. For the ‘Cats to survive in Big Ten play let alone get to March Madness their rebounding and/or perimeter defense will almost certainly need to improve as it works against the grain. That’s immensely difficult. Okay that’s a lot of negatives. Here’s some optimism: Arizona State presents another get-right opportunity on the glass for the ‘Cats. The Sun Devils have failed to secure over 32% of  their potential defensive rebounds. While their starting lineup is smaller than Northwestern’s ASU’s 30% three-point clip indicates it may not be able to stretch the floor enough to force Nicholson out of the game. Plus Northwestern is slowly trending upward in the rebounding department. After only securing 69.2% of its defensive boards against Chicago State the ‘Cats snagged 75.8% of DePaul’s missed attempts. With the exception of the Purdue rebounding battle (which to NU’s credit was pretty much impossible to keep close) Northwestern has played up to its competition on the glass. In order to ensure their perimeter stars get enough possessions to bring home victories the Wildcats will need to set a solid foundation for their team rebounding in their final two nonconference clashes. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Week 15 of the NFL season has come and gone and an unprecedented 11 NU alumni saw the field for their respective teams. Let’s take a look at what the former ‘Cats accomplished on the gridiron. Rashawn Slater: Los Angeles Chargers OT Slater played the worst game of his young career in a 63-21 drubbing at the hands of the Raiders. He gave up two sacks to defensive end Malcolm Koonce both of which ended in fumbles. In the first quarter Koonce bent around him for a strip sack that would set the Raiders up for a touchdown drive. Two quarters later he bent around Slater for another strip  sack that was returned by nose tackle John Jenkins for six.  The Chargers are now 5-9 and soundly at the bottom of the AFC West. With Justin Herbert out for the rest of the season Slater will have to protect Easton Stick for the next few weeks. He will look to bounce back at home against the Bills on Saturday night. Week 16 matchup: vs. Buffalo Bills (Saturday 7 p.m. CT) Greg Newsome II: Cleveland Browns CB Newsome had yet another stellar performance in the Browns’ 20-17 win against the Bears. He finished with four solo tackles — two of them for loss — and a pair of pass deflections. He had a chance to grab his third interception in six weeks but he let an errant pass by Justin Fields slip through his hands late in the second quarter. The Browns now hold an impressive 9-5 record tied with formidable teams like the Chiefs. Newsome has played a huge role in Cleveland’s defensive success and he’s only continuing to gain momentum. He has a chance to earn his first Pro Bowl selection as one of the league’s best slot corners. Week 16 matchup: at Houston Texans (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Peter Skoronski: Tennessee Titans OG Skoronski struggled in pass protection during the Titans’ 19-16 loss to the Texans in overtime. He was beat multiple times by Houston D-tackles Maliek Collins and Khalil Davis and the Titans gave up seven sacks as a team. Skoronski’s most egregious play came at a crucial moment — with 33 seconds left in regulation he got tossed aside by Collins and let Will Levis get crushed forcing Tennessee to punt.  Like his time at Northwestern the rookie guard has been excellent in the run game. But Skoronski must improve his balance when it comes to keeping Levis upright in the pocket. He’ll look to return to form against a league-average Seahawks pass-rush unit. Week 16 matchup: vs. Seattle Seahawks (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Cameron Mitchell: Cleveland Browns CB Mitchell made a massive impact in limited action in the Browns’ 20-17 win against Chicago. On a crucial fourth-and-1 in the fourth quarter he tripped up Justin Fields behind the line of scrimmage forcing a turnover on downs. That gave Mitchell his first NFL sack and the Browns would score 10 unanswered points after that play to secure the win. The fifth-round rookie has been an excellent addition to Cleveland’s secondary rotation. He’ll stay ready to make plays against the Texans who are in the thick of the AFC playoff race at 8-6.  Week 16 matchup: at Houston Texans (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Trevor Siemian: New York Jets QB Siemian had a rough showing in the Jets’ 30-0 loss to the Dolphins. He went 14-for-26 with two interceptions and a lost fumble in relief of a concussed Zach Wilson. Both of his picks came on errant deep shots in the second half as he tried to put points on the board. In two appearances this season Siemian has completed 48.7% of his passes for 176 yards without a touchdown. He’s also managed to cough up the ball four times. If Wilson can’t clear concussion protocol in time Siemian will likely get another chance as signal-caller against the Commanders.  Week 16 matchup: vs. Washington Commanders (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Ben Skowronek: Los Angeles Rams WR Skowronek left his typical mark on special teams in Los Angeles’ 28-20 against the Commanders. He made two tackles on 18 snaps as a gunner — the first came in the final play of the first half when he brought down tight end John Bates at Washington’s 39-yard line. Skowronek made his second tackle during the Commanders’ first punt of the third quarter when he stuffed Byron Pringle at Washington’s 25-yard line. The third-year receiver played just three offensive snaps so it’s clear that his role remains on the special teams unit. He’s remained focused on his job as a gunner despite the fact that his timeshare in the offense has dwindled. Skowronek will look to impact the game in any way he can on Thursday night against the Saints.  Week 16 matchup: vs. New Orleans Saints (Thursday 7:15 p.m. CT) Godwin Igwebuike: Pittsburgh Steelers RB Igwebuike had his best game of the season in the Steelers’ 30-13 loss to the Colts. He returned the game’s opening kick to Pittsburgh’s 38-yard line but the offense couldn’t get anything going. In the second quarter he brought a kick back to the team’s 36-yard line but that drive ended in an interception. The veteran running back set his team up for success twice but the Steelers have had their fair share of offensive woes in the last few weeks. Igwebuike will look to give new starting quarterback Mason Rudolph some help in the form of advantageous field position on Saturday against the Bengals.  Week 16 matchup: vs. Cincinnati Bengals (Saturday 3:30 p.m. CT) Joe Gaziano: Atlanta Falcons DE A new addition to this week’s column Gaziano notched his first tackle of the season in Atlanta’s 9-7 loss to the Panthers. He brought down Miles Sanders in the second quarter after a three-yard run bringing up 2nd-and-7 for Carolina. Gaziano played 22 defensive snaps and came in for the Falcons’ extra-point attempt in the second quarter. Undrafted in 2020 Gaziano recorded 30 sacks and 10 forced fumbles both of which are the most in Northwestern history. He was selected to the second-team All-Big Ten team in 2017 and 2018 and received first-team honors in 2019. Gaziano will look to build on his performance on Sunday afternoon against Gardner Minshew and the Colts.  Week 16 matchup: vs. Indianapolis Colts (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Blake Hance: Jacksonville Jaguars OL After last week’s deplorable performance Hance didn’t play nearly as much in Jacksonville’s 23-7 loss to the Ravens. He saw the field for five offensive snaps and three special teams snaps entering for jumbo packages and field goal attempts.  Though he isn’t a starter Hance is still a valuable member of the Jaguars’ offensive line. He’s been vital in a season full of minor injuries for the team’s pass protectors. Hance will stay ready to contribute in a road showdown against the Buccaneers. Week 16 matchup: at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (Sunday 3:05 p.m. CT) Tyler Lancaster: Denver Broncos DT Lancaster saw his first NFL action since Week 11 in the Broncos’ 42-17 loss to the Lions. He didn’t record any statistics but he played 11 defensive snaps as a run stopper. This was his third game of the season. The veteran tackle notched 18.5 tackles for loss in three years as a Wildcat including nine as a senior in 2017. He’ll look to stuff the Patriots’ run game at home on Sunday night. Week 16 matchup: vs. New England Patriots (Sunday 7:15 p.m. CT) Earnest Brown IV: Los Angeles Rams DE Brown was featured as a rotational lineman during the Rams’ 28-20 win over the Commanders. He played nine defensive snaps but did not record any statistics. This was Brown’s first game since Week Seven and his fifth appearance of the season. The second-year defender recorded seven sacks and 18.5 tackles for loss in his four years at Northwestern. Brown will look to impact the game in any way he can during Thursday night’s matchup against the Saints. Week 16 matchup: vs. New Orleans Saints (Thursday 7:15 p.m. CT) ‘Cats that didn’t play this week: Anthony Walker Jr. (Cleveland Browns knee) Adetomiwa Adebawore (Indianapolis Colts) Joseph Jones (Tennessee Titans) Dean Lowry (Minnesota Vikings torn pectoral) Evan Hull (Indianapolis Colts torn meniscus) Ifeadi Odenigbo (New York Jets injured reserve) \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Northwestern wrestling looks a bit different this season but the younger talent has provided reason for optimism. Although Big Ten play doesn’t begin until the middle of January the ‘Cats have had a busy month of tournaments. Michigan State Open Northwestern opened its season with nine podium finishes including two titles in the Michigan State Open. First-year Jacob Bostelman claimed the title in the 157-pound freshman/sophomore division.  He picked up victories by a margin of 4-3 and 4-2 before winning by a technical fall in the semifinals. Another technical fall in the championship round sealed off the momentous day.  Joel VanderVere had similar luck in the 141-pound open division. Following three decisions of 5-3 11-7 and 7-3 the redshirt sophomore was granted a bye in the championship. Colby McClain and Sam Cartella also had strong showings for first-years booking a second-place and third-place finish in the 141 and 149-pound divisions respectively. In the 197-pound open division redshirt sophomore Evan Bates and graduate student Jack Jessen found success in the silver and bronze spots. Bates who ranked No. 20 at the time took down two Big Ten foes in Michigan State’s Lucas Daly and Michigan’s Brendin Yatooma en route to the runner-up spot.  Lindenwood Open The following week the ‘Cats headed to Missouri where they secured four third-place finishes.  After losing his first match redshirt junior David Ferrante won four straight bouts. He took third place in the 174-pound division after pinning his opponent in just 41 seconds.  Bostelman and fellow first-years Massey Odiotti and Luiz Bazan scored third-place finishes in the 157 125 and 133-pound classes. Similarly to Ferrante Bostelman and Bazan rebounded with five consecutive victories after a loss in their initial match.  In the 149-pound division Cartella finished fifth with redshirt sophomore Aiden Vandenbush in sixth.  Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invitational  Unlike last year’s 10th-place finish the Wildcats had a much quieter outing this time around. They gathered 22 points to place 25th while Iowa State the champion scored 130.5 points.  Trevor Chumbley stood out for Northwestern. The redshirt senior placed eighth in his season debut after fininishing fifth the previous year. The 157-pounder lost his first bout but won the next four which included beating three of FloWrestling’s ranked wrestlers. Jessen Bates Ferrante redshirt junior Maxx Mayfield and redshirt senior Troy Fisher also made it to the Round of 16. Northwestern lost some of its strongest talent this season with Lucas Davison Michael DeAugustino and Chris Cannon all transferring to Michigan. Especially as Davison finishied second in his division at the invitational the Wildcats are reminded that this season is about building a foundation for the future. Nonetheless NU will need solid outings from Chumbley to find any success this season so his podium finish is refreshing.  Cleveland State Open  The ‘Cats scored five top-six finishes highlighted by two fourth-place finishes from Cartella and redshirt first-year Joseph Martin. Cartella had three major decision victories before falling in his last bout in the 149-pound division. For the 174-pound class Martin’s four victories included two bonus point ones via technical falls.  Ferrante and redshirt senior Jon Halvorsen found fifth place in 174 and 184 pounds. Ferrante’s day was marked by three bonus point victories across his five wins including two 15-0 wins.  McClain also clocked in at sixth in his class and notched his second pinfall victory.  Looking Ahead Although the ‘Cats are not off to a dominant start they have faired well for a team going through change. Bostelman McClain and Cartella have been bright spots as the first-years have provide hop that will NU soon reclaim its success from recent years. In the meantime Ferrante Chumbley Bates and Jessen have seemed to pick up where they left off and could be in for solid veteran seasons.  Before 2024 can begin Northwestern will open up the dual portion of its season against Northern Illinois on Tuesday and close out the year with the 59th Ken Kraft Midlands Championships.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story It’s safe to say that not many saw this Northwestern football season coming. Just over a year ago the Wildcats lost 41-3 to Illinois wrapping up their 2022 campaign with an 11th straight loss and not a single win in the United States. Pat Fitzgerald’s program had nowhere to go but up.  Yet somehow it went down. Hazing allegations around the program engulfed the summer ultimately leading to Fitzgerald’s firing. The dark days around the squad made it seem near-impossible for the Wildcats to have a successful season in 2023. As I wrote in July the future was grim for the Northwestern football team. Enter: interim head coach David Braun. We know the rest. Braun is no longer the interim head coach. Northwestern finally won a game in the United States after over 700 days and it won seven of them. After going 1-11 in 2022 and losing top players in Peter Skoronski Evan Hull and Cam Mitchell to name a few Northwestern finished with a winning record securing bowl eligibility for the first time in three years. As captain Bryce Gallagher promised after the season-opening loss to Rutgers the ‘Cats did in fact go on to have a “successful season.” Still NU can prove so much more on Saturday in the Las Vegas Bowl against Utah both as a statement for the 2023 team and the football program in general. A win would go miles for the Wildcats who nobody thought would come close to touching a bowl game. Let’s start with the short-term implications of a win versus the Utes. First this is going to be one of the toughest opponents Northwestern has played this year. Utah is a strong PAC-12 (soon to be Big 12) team sitting at 8-4 with all of their losses coming against ranked opponents. It took No. 2 Washington who is now playing in the College Football Playoff down to the wire in Seattle. The Utes beat one of the best quarterbacks in the country and the potential first overall draft pick Caleb Williams in Los Angeles. The most impressive thing is Utah spent the entire season without its star quarterback in Cam Rising who did not play this season due to a torn ACL. Before this season Utah was the two-time defending PAC-12 champions beating Oregon in 2021 and USC in 2022. It made the PAC-12 Championship in 2020 and was on the border of making the College Football Playoff that year. The Utes have been one of the top college football programs for the past few years and what Kyle Whittingham has done for the program has been special. Additionally Rising returns to Salt Lake City next year as Utah shifts over to the Big 12 giving it a real chance to win the conference. So what would a Northwestern win over this program mean for the 2023 team? To start it means that this season was not a fluke. Utah’s success over the past few seasons has come from talented players great coaching and a team that sticks together. If Northwestern can beat this unit a program that has seen nearly everything over the past half-decade it shows what the Wildcats did in 2023 is real. Moreover Northwestern deserves to play a top program like Utah. The ‘Cats were a last-minute field goal away from traveling down the road to Indianapolis to play the No. 1 team in the country in Michigan; no matter what would have happened in that game getting there is an accomplishment in itself. A win against a Utah team would show that Northwestern can play with some of the nation’s top dogs. It would also be some nice hardware — the HAT is already back in Evanston and a bowl trophy right next to it would make the 2023 season one that will be hard to forget. It would also set the slate for the 2024 season. Northwestern has one of the hardest schedules in the country next year featuring games against Michigan Ohio State and Washington — all of whom should be top-six teams heading into the preseason — a reloaded Duke squad with Manny Diaz and a contest against a Miami (Ohio) team that just went 11-2. Winning against the Utes would give many the belief that Northwestern can compete in some of these games. The path to a bowl game is there next season and a win in the Las Vegas Bowl would make this more believable. Even more than what’s on the 2024 horizon a victory against Utah would have major long-term implications for Northwestern football for years to come. The college football slate is going to be completely different next year. The Big Ten is welcoming Washington Oregon USC and UCLA. Plenty of national championship contenders are in the conference; Michigan and Washington are both in the playoff this season and Ohio State and Oregon missed out because of losses to the Wolverines and Huskies respectively. Throw in Penn State and USC programs that have the talent to make the playoff and it is clear there is star power in the conference. The College Football Playoff will have 12 teams meaning that there will be tons of Big Ten teams vying for spots and some of them will be mainstays. If Northwestern wants to “get purple to the College Football Playoff” as Braun said a win against Utah will launch this trajectory. To put it into perspective a bowl game win is big for any program. It means a lot to the players who work their tails off throughout the season to have an opportunity to compete in late December. It’s a testament to their willingness to buy into a program. But to get a bowl win against a Utah team that has had recent success all in Braun’s first year? It would go miles for the ‘Cats especially with all they have been through recently. Even if Northwestern loses the impact the 2023 team has had on Northwestern football is massive. There’s not one program in the nation that experienced this type of turnaround this year and a bowl win against a successful program in Utah would be the cherry on top. Now attention shifts to Saturday to see if the Wildcats can get it done.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Bowl bound for the first time in four seasons Northwestern’s 2023 story is nothing short of remarkable. Northwestern’s six-win improvement from 1-11 in 2022 to 7-5 in 2023 is the largest win improvement by any FBS team this season — not to mention the minefield of adversity this group had to cross with offseason scandal a coaching change and uncertainty.  After their 23-15 home win against Purdue in mid-November secured bowl eligibility — and a student section stampede gave Ryan Field a proper sendoff — the ‘Cats put a cherry on top of the regular season reclaiming the Land of Lincoln Trophy with a thrilling 45-43 win in Champaign. Northwestern’s season was a true testament of enjoying the highs — think of NU’s first victory at Ryan Field in two seasons against UTEP Charlie Mangieri’s game-winning overtime touchdown against Minnesota or Coco Azema’s game-sealing interception versus Maryland. It was also marked by having to push through the lows — like a brutal Week One loss to Rutgers dropping a one-possession clash against Nebraska or losing via a heart-breaking last-second Hawkeye field goal through the uprights in front of Wrigley Field’s right field bleachers. A Big Ten schedule is punishing but through the disappointment and letdown of each loss Northwestern rallied finishing the season with three straight victories and never holding a multi-game losing streak. On the field Northwestern’s commitment to complementary football kept the ‘Cats in games. In 2022 Northwestern finished the year with a -19 turnover margin. In 2023 that number soared to +10 the seventh-highest margin in the nation powered by an FBS-best one lost fumble all season — a wild turnaround after Northwestern’s 14 lost fumbles just a year ago ranked second-to-last in the country. It was David Braun’s leadership that powered Northwestern’s success. Winning over the locker room and fans’ support with his keep-it-real attitude — unafraid of displaying his emotions in postgame interviews and press conferences — Braun’s seven wins were the most by a first-year head coach since Walter McCornack’s 10 wins in 1903 — the same year the Wright brothers took flight and before the forward pass was even legalized in the college game (1906). Earning the Big Ten Coach of the Year award and Northwestern’s full-time head coaching job are small honors next to the historical success Braun achieved — becoming the first NU head coach to make a bowl appearance in his debut season. Evident from the skipper’s “Purple to the College Football Playoff” rallying cry during Northwestern’s upset win over No. 1 Purdue in Welsh-Ryan Arena Braun’s long-term goals for this team stretch far beyond making the SRS Distribution Bowl in Las Vegas. Although whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas the momentum of extra practices and  extra reps for Northwestern’s youngsters and an injection of postseason experience into Northwestern’s DNA will push the ‘Cats ahead into a new era of Big Ten football. The benefits of added opportunities to compete on the field are paramount for an underdog program primed to compete against bonafide competition like Washington Oregon USC and UCLA in the coming years. We are three days away from a late afternoon kickoff in Allegiant Stadium where the ‘Cats will meet a familiar bowl game opponent. After trailing 20-3 at the half Northwestern’s last meeting with Utah ended in a 31-20 comeback victory at the 2018 Holiday Bowl. After losing in the Rose Bowl the last two seasons Utah’s 2023 campaign was a struggle in its own right without star QB Cam Rising. However thanks to finishing the season as the PAC-12’s least penalized team second-best rushing offense and the country’s fourth-best run defense in total yards Utah scraped together an 8-4 record with impressive victories over ranked UCLA and USC teams. Good news for Northwestern is the slew of players unavailable for Utah in Las Vegas. With about a dozen Utes in the transfer portal having injuries and a handful of players declaring for the NFL Draft some of Utah’s best impact players — like First-Team All-PAC-12 pass rusher Jonah Elliss leading receiver Devaughn Vele and shifty duel threat safety and running back Sione Vaki — won’t take the field in Las Vegas. With Utah’s schematic focus on running the football Northwestern will need to rely on its rushing defense which allowed a Big Ten-worst 159.5 yards per game. The recipe for success is stopping the run on early downs and forcing the Utes into passing situations with multiple of their best pass catchers unavailable. Putting pressure on QB Bryson Barnes is essential too with Barnes’ arm a threat from a clean pocket. The Utes’ signal caller is also a threat to escape the pocket meaning Northwestern’s defense will be challenged even without a multitude of Utes in uniform. Offensively the best place to attack Utah is its secondary. Although the Utes’ pass defense finished second-best in the PAC-12 — with both starting safeties and a starting corner unavailable for Morgan Scalley’s defense — Ben Bryant’s connection with Cam Johnson Bryce Kirtz and AJ Henning will be an emphasis for Mike Bajakian’s game plan.  But as always the game will be won or lost in the battle between Northwestern’s up-and-down offensive line against the fourth-best pass rushing defense in the PAC-12 (minus superstar Jonah Elliss and his 12 sacks). In games where the offensive line has been up to the challenge — against UTEP Minnesota or Illinois — the ‘Cats have fared well. When they’ve been outmanned — against Rutgers or Penn State for instance — things haven’t been so pretty. Either way the end of Northwestern’s season will rely heavily on a group that’s dictated wins and losses this year. Writing a story of unexpected success Northwestern has a chance to add a tally to its program-record four-straight bowl wins and reach the eight-win mark for the first time since 2018. But whether you’ve made the trek to Las Vegas or are watching from home on Saturday don’t let a potential loss bitter an unthinkable campaign or forget a season filled with twists turns and unprecedented surprises that led the ‘Cats here in the first place. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story This was a completely different Northwestern side than the one that lost to Chicago State a week ago. Chris Collins’ bunch imposed its will against a thoroughly outmatched Arizona State squad on both sides of the ball in NU’s first real test since the disaster-class last Wednesday. Northwestern outscored the Sun Devils 36-13 in the first half and never really looked in danger of giving this one away. Here are three takeaways from the win. The defense looks like it’s coming together Much of Northwestern’s success last season can be attributed to its hounding perimeter defense but with Chase Audige’s departure this year’s unit has looked less than stellar at times. The rotations have often been sloppy leading to a lot of open looks from three and Northwestern has consistently struggled to defend quick guards. Chicago State’s Wesley Cardet Jr. coasted to a season-high 30 points on 62% shooting in the Cougars’ upset victory and the Wildcats had no answer for Mississippi State’s Josh Hubbard in their November loss to the Bulldogs.  Arizona State runs its offense almost exclusively through quick guards like Cardet Jr. and Hubbard. Its two leading scorers — Frankie Collins and the former Illini Adam Miler — are both guards under 6-foot-3 who don’t shoot very well from three and make their living getting to the rim.  Yet the ASU offense looked anemic on Wednesday. The Sun Devils struggled to generate open looks on offense and Miller and Collins combined to shoot 6-for-26. Northwestern’s rotations looked sharp and its guards played with an energy that has been missing for stretches of this season.  Since Northwestern allowed 75 points to Chicago State and KenPom’s 329th-rated offense the ‘Cats have held their opponents to just 46 points in back-to-back games. It’s just two games and Northwestern faces vastly more potent offenses in their future but it does appear that the Chicago State loss has reignited the ‘Cats’ defensive fire.  Conference play will be a lot more fun if the guards continue to rebound like they did yesterday Rebounding has also been an issue for the ‘Cats early in the season. DePaul and Chicago State — two teams that have been statistically poor on the glass — both out-rebounded Northwestern last week and even in the win against Purdue Northwestern was outgained 52-27.   The ‘Cats have been running a relatively small lineup this year with Matthew Nicholson often playing as the only big man. Yet Northwestern’s resident 7-footer only averages a measly 3.5 rebounds a game.   But on Wednesday the ‘Cats out-rebounded Arizona State 41-32 much due to the efforts of their four guards. Ty Berry led Northwestern’s strong rebounding evening grabbing a season-high 10 boards and Brooks Barnhizer secured nine of his own. Even Boo Buie and Ryan Langborg had a strong showing on the glass combining for 11 more rebounds between the two of them.  Arizona State boasts a similarly negative rebounding profile to the ‘Cats and the Sun Devils have been out-rebounded in all but two of their games so far this season but this performance still bodes well for the ‘Cats. If Northwestern’s core four can continue to be strong on the glass and help remedy some of the team’s early season rebounding issues the ‘Cats will be a force to be reckoned with in Big Ten play. Nicholson’s early season struggles are alarming There were a lot of positives from Wednesday’s victory but Nicholson was borderline invisible against Arizona State. In a game where he was the tallest player on the court by a good three inches the center only managed a measly two points and three rebounds in 19 minutes. Big Matt was still relatively effective on the defensive end — his size gave the Sun Devils fits in the paint — but his lack of offensive production and seeming inability to rebound continue to be alarming especially for an otherwise undersized Northwestern lineup.  Nicholson who was big for the ‘Cats down the stretch last season has noticeably regressed in both his scoring and rebounding numbers dropping by two from a season ago in both categories. His defense remains important but the ‘Cats will no doubt need more from their big man against more physical Big Ten opponents.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story On Wednesday 15 members of the Class of 2024 signed their national letters of intent to pursue their collegiate football careers at Northwestern. This recruiting class the first under David Braun ranks 96th nationally and last in the Big Ten according to 247 Sports. The Wildcats could not land any four or five-stars this year and they lost several other players in the wake of Pat Fitzgerald’s firing. However a majority of the commits this year are three-star recruits. With all the players now officially committed let’s get to know the 15 newest Wildcats. Timi Oke – CB The three-star cornerback will arrive in Evanston all the way from the NFL Academy in London England. Oke is the 171st-ranked corner and the third-best recruit from England according to 247 Sports. His only Power Five offer was from Northwestern but the 6-foot 171-pound prospect had offers from several other schools including UConn and Bryant. Oke is new to the football scene having only begun playing at the NFL Academy in 2023. He spent most of his childhood playing soccer and before switching to football he even had interest from the English Premier League’s Brighton & Hove Albion according to ESPN. Perhaps his strongest trait is his speed as he ran a 4.48 40-yard dash. His speed and agility will be a valuable asset for him as he continues to adjust to American football. Matthew Smith – LB The three-star linebacker comes to Northwestern from Hillside High School in Durham North Carolina. Smith is the 179th-best linebacker in the nation and the 50th-best recruit in the state of North Carolina per 247 Sports. The 6-foot-2 208-pound commit chose to join the Wildcats his only Power Five offer over nearby Northern Illinois. Smith runs a speedy 4.38 40-yard dash according to his Hudl profile and his speed assists his already strong ability to disrupt the pass rush and sack the quarterback. At 208 pounds he could certainly benefit from bulking up a bit but Smith is nonetheless an exciting talent that could play a large role on Northwestern’s defense in the coming years. Callen Campbell – DL Campbell a three-star defensive lineman treks south to Evanston from Sault Area High School in Sault Sainte Marie Michigan. He ranks as the 112th-best defensive lineman in the nation and the 22nd-best player from the state of Michigan according to 247 Sports. Campbell did not receive a Power Five offer aside from Northwestern but he was being recruited by other Division I schools like Army and Columbia. Throughout high school Campbell was highly praised for his versatility. At 6-foot-4 240 pounds he contributed to his team not only as a defensive lineman but also as a tight end and outside linebacker. He also brings with him incredible strength having won two state championships in powerlifting per his Hudl profile. Campbell could very well become a high-impact player for the Wildcat defense in the near future. Braxton Strong – DL Strong is a three-star defensive lineman making a short trip to Northwestern from Peru High School in Peru Indiana. According to 247 Sports he ranks as the 171st-best defensive lineman in the country and the 22nd-best overall player in Indiana. Though he opted to commit to Northwestern Strong also garnered strong interest from schools like Colorado State Central Michigan and Akron. At 6-foot-4 235 pounds Strong boasts a similar stature to his future teammate Campbell and that’s not the only thing they share in common. Just like Campbell Strong also spent part of his high school career playing tight end. As a senior Strong posted four sacks and seven tackles for loss and he will look to build on that campaign during his first season as a Wildcat. Sean Martin – S ATH The three-star safety/utility man will remain in the midwest coming to Evanston from St. Ignatius High School the Cleveland Ohio football powerhouse. He is the 194th-best utility player in the nation and the 83rd-best player in Ohio per 247 Sports. He opted to continue his football career at Northwestern over schools like Toledo Akron and Eastern Michigan. Martin is a special player in that he can excel anywhere in the secondary whether coaches put him at safety or at cornerback. He also played running back throughout high school though it is less likely that Northwestern will use him in that role. Martin is an athletic playmaker who has the potential to be a lockdown defender for the Wildcats if he develops correctly. Idrys Cotton – OL Cotton a three-star offensive lineman comes to Northwestern from Plymouth High School in Canton Michigan. 247 Sports ranked him as the 84th-best interior offensive lineman in the nation and the 20th-best player in Michigan. The 6-foot-4 280-pound recruit chose Northwestern over several other Power Five schools including Colorado Duke and Louisville. Cotton is an intelligent playmaker who excels at pass protection. His large stature should also benefit him against opposing defenders. He is certainly one of Northwestern’s most exciting recruits in the Class of 2024 and given his raw potential there is no reason he cannot follow in the footsteps of the likes of Rashawn Slater or Peter Skoronski. Terrion Hicks – CB The three-star cornerback joins the Wildcats’ defensive unit from Frederick Douglass High School in Lexington Kentucky. 247 Sports deemed Hicks the 181st-best cornerback in the nation and the 17th-best player from Kentucky. He had one other Power Five offer from Stanford and several offers from schools such as Central Michigan and Miami (Ohio). Hicks is exceptionally fast posting a 4.4 40-yard dash. His speed in combination with his elite coverage will be invaluable to Northwestern’s secondary for years to come. There are some concerns about his size as he is only 5-foot-11 170 pounds. However if he bulks up a little bit he could become a staple of the Wildcat defense during his time in Evanston. Troy Regovich – DL Regovich is a three-star defensive lineman joining Northwestern after contributing to three consecutive state championships for St. Edward High School of Lakewood Ohio. He is the 207th-best defensive lineman in the country and the 83rd-best player from Ohio according to 247 Sports. Regovich opted for Northwestern over Kentucky his other Power Five offer and schools including Army Eastern Michigan and Miami (Ohio). At Northwestern Regovich will reunite with his former teammate Michael Kilbane who was one of the Wildcats’ most coveted acquisitions in the Class of 2023. Though Regovich is not as flashy of a prospect as Kilbane who was the 53rd-ranked pass rusher in his class he excels at defending the run something Northwestern struggled with this season. Dashun Reeder – RB The three-star running back comes to Evanston from Christ Church Episcopal School in Greenville South Carolina. According to 247 Sports Reeder is the 113th-best running back in his class and the 24th-best player in South Carolina. He picked Northwestern over several other competitive offers including Georgia Tech Cincinnati and James Madison. The 6-foot 190-pound running back is an explosive playmaker averaging 6.8 yards per carry and 115 yards per game during a senior season that culminated in 25 touchdowns. Northwestern lacked a consistently explosive back during the 2023 season and someone like Reeder could be exactly what the Wildcats need to revitalize the run game. Ryan Boe – QB The three-star quarterback will stay close to home joining Northwestern from nearby Batavia High School in Batavia Illinois. He ranks as the 90th-best quarterback in the country and the 37th-best player in Illinois according to 247 Sports. Boe chose to continue his athletic career at Northwestern over offers from North Dakota State Colgate and UPenn including decommitting from the Bison to follow Braun. In his senior season at Batavia Boe threw for just under 3000 yards. Additionally he tossed  33 touchdowns to only three interceptions as he led Batavia to become the No. 5 team in Illinois following an 11-2 record. It is unlikely that Boe will see immediate action given Northwestern’s crowded quarterback room but he is certainly someone to keep an eye on to potentially lead the Wildcats as he continues to progress. Carson Grove – WR ATH Grove a three-star wide receiver/utility man is also staying put in the Chicago area joining the Wildcat offense from John Hersey High School in Arlington Heights. 247 Sports lists him as the 191st-best utility man in the nation and the 48th-best player from Illinois. Northwestern was his only Power Five offer but he received other offers from schools like North Dakota State Navy and Yale. Grove put up a monster season for John Hersey this year with his 1436 receiving yards leading the state of Illinois. His combination of flashy speed and crisp route-running make him a nightmare matchup for defenders. However size could be an issue for the receiver who is listed as 5-foot-10 170 pounds. He will need to bulk up in order to physically compete with the top talent of the Big Ten. If he does so Grove could end up being a total steal for the Wildcats. Patrick Schaller – TE Schaller is yet another Wildcat already familiar with the area. The three-star tight end hails from Glenbrook North High School in Northbrook. He is the 40th-best tight end in the nation and the 16th best player in Illinois according to 247Sports — making him the highest-touted recruit in this year’s group. Schaller chose to remain close to home over other offers from Boston College and Central Michigan. Schaller is a physical receiver who excels at making contested catches. And at 6-foot-5 210 pounds he is a physically dominant blocker who made it challenging for opposing defenses to pressure his quarterback. A talented receiver and blocker Schaller has all the tools necessary to become one of the better tight ends in college football. Hayden Eligon II – WR The three-star receiver comes to Evanston from the west coast playing for Los Alamitos High School in Southern California. According to 247 Sports he is the 225th-best wide receiver in the nation and the 138th-best player from the state of California. Eligon II picked Northwestern over offers from several Power Five schools including Arizona California and Louisville. Eligon II has an innate ability to get open and evade defenders making him an easy target to target. Yet at 6-foot-4 190 pounds he is also a physically dominant receiver who can make tough catches in traffic and break tackles. Eligon II’s physicality and knack for getting open should excite Wildcat fans throughout the next four years. Tito Williams – S Williams is a three-star safety arriving at Northwestern from Bradley Central High School in Cleveland Tennessee. 247 Sports lists him as the 109th-best safety in the country and the 27th-best player from Tennessee. Williams had several other Power Five offers from schools like Ole Miss Vanderbilt and West Virginia but he ultimately chose to don purple for the next four years. Williams is lockdown on defense and he can keep pace with virtually any receiver he’s covering. Additionally he’s effective on the blitz when needed often able to pick up a sack or blow up a rush attempt. Look for Williams to develop into a player who could potentially anchor the Wildcats’ secondary during his upperclassman years. Qayvier Johnson – LB Johnson is a linebacker arriving at Northwestern from Hamden Hall High School in Hamden Connecticut. Though he is a zero-star recruit Johnson also received an offer from Big Ten rival Indiana and other Division I schools like UConn and Yale. In his first season at Hamden Hall after his former high school cut funding for its football program Johnson recorded 15 sacks and 60 total tackles. He is a skilled pass rusher adept at blitzing through the offensive line. Johnson could be a fun guy to watch if that talent translates to his collegiate career. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Down by 11 in the second quarter up by 10 in the third.  Northwestern (5-7 0-1 B1G)  came out strong in the second half to defeat Temple (6-6 0-0 ACC) 72-68. This is the ‘Cats’ second straight win after dropping six straight before facing Bradley on Sunday. The star of the show was Melannie Daley.  The junior scored 21 points all of which came in the second half and had four boards to propel the comeback. Junior Caleigh Walsh and first-year Casey Harter also chipped in 16 and 13 points respectively as well as seven and five rebounds. For Temple junior Tiarra East senior Rayne Tucker and fifth-year Aleah Nelson scored 20 19 and 16 points. Tucker also had 13 rebounds.  Northwestern won the opening tip but the ‘Cats were unable to score the first points of the game. On the Owls’ first possession East made an easy layup to which Walsh responded with a three.  Nelson and Walsh both added two points to give Northwestern a short 5-4 lead before Temple went on an 11-point run. Sophomore Caroline Lau sank one of two free throws for the Wildcats’ first points in over three minutes and subsequently gave her team the motivation it needed. Paige Mott made a layup off an Owl turnover to make it 13-8.  Two missed Temple shots gave way to layups from Walsh and Harter to bring the ‘Cats within one 13-12. Senior Ines Piper halted the 7-0 sprint with a basket but Harter soon evened the score at 15 with a three sparked by a steal from Lau. With just four seconds left East sank a three to give the Owls an 18-15 lead at the end of the first quarter. In just 10 minutes the guard scored as many points.  Racing against the shot clock a second-chance hook shot extended Temple’s advantage by five points to open the second quarter. After a collection of missed shots and a media timeout Tucker made a layup and East made one of two free throws to go up 23-15.  A layup from Mott gave Northwestern its first basket of the second quarter at 7:25.  Following four missed shots on a Temple drive and a failed Northwestern drive Tucker added a layup to break the short scoring drought in which she garnered three offensive rebounds.  Head coach Joe McKeown called a timeout to answer another three from East that further put the ‘Cats behind 28-17. In over five minutes Northwestern managed just a single basket. After three missed shots from both teams Walsh ended the nearly five-minute scoring drought for her team with an easy layup 28-19.  Suddenly the double-digit deficit dwindled as a defensive rebound from Lau led her to add a layup and graduate student Maggie Pina made a jumper. Off a rebound Lau ran down the court to add another shot. Before the half ended Rayne and Northwestern’s Mercy Ademusayo both added baskets leaving Temple with a 30-26 lead. Through two quarters the ‘Cats and Owls made 46% and 30% of their field goals respectively. Although NU managed just two baskets through the first half of the second quarter it outshot Temple 7-2 in the last three minutes to make this game much closer than it seemed it would be for most of the half.  Northwestern began the second half by evening the score at 30 off baskets from Wash and Mott. Daley then made a jumper to give the Wildcats their first lead since being up 5-4 just two minutes into game action.  Piper evened it back up but just seconds later a pullup jumper by Harter gave the ‘Cats back their lead. This trend continued with Ademusayo answering a pair of free throws from Tucker and then East answering Mott with free throws. A jumper from Daley and free throws from Mott gave NU its biggest lead of the day at 42-37.  Eventually Temple evened the score at 45 with Tucker making five points in just over a minute. But two free throws and a layup from Daley across 35 seconds put NU up 49-45 head into the last frame. Daley’s hot hand continued into the fourth making two free throws and a jumper between a Temple basket. She then added another shot to keep NU ahead 55-47 and make her 10th consecutive point. Temple closed in on the lead with two baskets answered by you guessed it Daley. Senior Tarryiyonna Gary then made a three and yes Daley responded for her 10th point of the quarter and 14th straight Northwestern point. Walsh and Harter both joined Daley on the scoring action making it 64-54 and prompting an Owl timeout. East made a three out of the break and Nelson added another layup. However two free throws from senior Jasmine McWilliams kept NU with a seven-point advantage at 66-59. The Owls fought for a comeback in the last minute. It was 70-68 with just eight seconds left as Nelson made a three and was rewarded with two free throws.  Harter hit two crucial free throws before the clock hit zero to secure the 72-68 victory.  Northwestern will close out 2023 by returning to Big Ten play against Rutgers on Dec. 30 at 2 p.m. CT.

Is an upset in the cards? Share this story Against all odds the Wildcats won seven games in the regular season and now find themselves in an unexpected position: bowl season. On Saturday Dec. 23 they will take on a familiar foe in the Las Vegas Bowl when they take on Utah. Northwestern beat the Utes a few years back in the 2018 Holiday Bowl and now a rematch is in order. Just as they were coming into this season the Wildcats are underdogs once more entering this game. Here are three reasons why that shouldn’t (or should) be the case. \nWhy Northwestern will beat Utah\n The Northwestern passing attack can stand out against a shorthanded Utah secondary  Utah is down both starting safeties after Cole Bishop and Sione Vaki both declared for the NFL draft and announced their intentions of sitting out this game. The Utes are also without starting cornerback JaTravis Broughton after he entered the transfer portal. This should open a window for Northwestern quarterback Ben Bryant to continue his recent stretch of quality play.  Bryant has thrown for 1177 yards to go with nine touchdowns to just three interceptions in his last five starts. He also has three rushing touchdowns in that span in which the Wildcats have won four of his last five starts. If Bryant can continue to play at this level against a depleted Utah secondary Northwestern could surprise some folks. Special teams There aren’t a lot of areas where Northwestern has the edge on paper. The one exception is an area that is often overlooked yet ultimately has a habit of showing itself in close games. The Wildcats rank 18th in the nation in special teams efficiency according to ESPN Analytics. Meanwhile the Utes rank 84th. Behind the low ranking is a return unit that ranks 61st in average kickoff return yardage and 111th in average kickoff return yardage allowed.  Additionally Utah ranks 105th in average punt return yardage and 78th in average punt return yardage allowed. On the Northwestern side of things the punting unit has obviously had its fair share of struggles (more on that in a bit) but there is opportunity in the special teams phase for the Wildcats. Momentum vs. a stoppable force The Utes come in as losers of three of their last five and two of their last three games. The lone victory? A six-point win at home over a hapless Colorado squad. Meanwhile Northwestern comes in having won four of its last five and on a three-game winning streak. It has all the momentum whereas Utah has none. Throw in the fact that they come in as the underdog with no pressure riding on the result and the Wildcats can come into this game carefree a privilege that the Utes can not benefit from.  Utah has lost its last four bowl games a streak that was started in that 2018 bowl loss to Northwestern. Meanwhile Northwestern has won the last four bowl games they have appeared in dating back to 2016. Whether it be from this season or bowl seasons past the Wildcats have all the momentum while the Utes have proven to be far from unstoppable. \nWhy Northwestern won’t beat Utah\n The Utah rushing attack could run wild against a porous Wildcat run defense Northwestern can’t stop the run. It hasn’t been able to do so all season and is unlikely to start now. The Wildcats rank 81st in the nation in rushing defense and just two games ago allowed Purdue to rush for over 300 yards. On the flip side Utah sports the 26th-best rushing attack in the country and ran for a shade under 270 yards the last time they took the field. Earlier I mentioned this game could be a matter of Northwestern’s momentum versus the very stoppable force that is Utah during bowl season but the same sentiment could be put forth when describing the Utes’ rushing offense going up against the Wildcats’ non-existent rushing defense. Special teams are an edge but the Wildcats will likely lose the field position battle The Wildcats haven’t been able to stop shooting themselves in the foot when it comes time to punt the football this season. In a game like this one that’ll make it hard for Northwestern to steal a victory. Northwestern ranks 98th nationally in net punting behind punter Hunter Renner and his net punting average of just 37.6 yards.  This is the one aspect of special teams in which Utah has an advantage over the Wildcats. Utah ranks 24th in the same category and in a game where the Wildcats are already a decent-sized underdog they can’t afford any gaffes in the punting department if they want to win. Kyle Whittingham and the talent gap Even with its large number of outgoing transfers who aren’t playing in this game it’s arguable that Utah not only has more talent at almost every level than Northwestern but they have one of the best coaches in the country helping grow that talent. Ultimately this is all this game could come down to. Going into this game the national consensus is that the Utes are simply the better team. According to the 247Sports Team Talent Composite Utah is the 33rd-most talented team in the country. Northwestern ranks 52nd in that metric.  Coaching that talent is Whittingham who has been the full-time head coach at Utah since 2005. He ranks seventh among active coaches in career wins with 162 or 155 more than first-year Northwestern coach David Braun for those keeping track at home. Talent plus exponentially more experience on the coaching front could equal a big victory for the Utes.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story It’s officially bowl week. Northwestern traveled out to the Sin City for the Las Vegas Bowl against Utah on Saturday. To fill us in on the Utes Inside NU spoke to Josh Furlong Sports Director of KSL.com. INU: Utah has seen many players opt out of this game for various reasons. What version of the Utes should the Wildcats expect? Furlong:  Though it’s ultimately difficult to know what the motivation level will be for this Utah team I believe it will be a lot like the version during the regular season. With so many players in and out of the lineup due to injury Utah’s players have been forced to be nimble and adapt to constant change. In some ways I believe this helps them going into the bowl game. Utah lost a lot of talent in the wide receiver room but the Utes have always relied on its run game and that room has a lot of depth and will be ready to go. If they can establish the run Utah will be able to do most of what it wants to do. INU: Bryson Barnes has entered the transfer portal yet he is still expected to start for Utah. What can be expected from Barnes and do you think the Utes may have a different signal caller under center? Furlong: Outside of Barnes Utah doesn’t have a lot of experienced options at quarterback. Ideally they’d have redshirt freshman Brandon Rose taking snaps and getting some experience but he hasn’t seen the field in two seasons and was forced to sit out due to an unfortunate injury in fall camp. Rose will still be an option as the backup but Barnes is the only real option here. Though Barnes is in the portal it shouldn’t impact anything. For the last three seasons Barnes has continued to defy odds and fights harder than most on the team. Though a former walk-on he’s continued to beat out other quarterbacks. He’s limited in his ability but he’s been good enough for Utah. INU: Northwestern’s offense is powered by its passing game. With Utah’s top two safeties not playing how does its secondary matchup against the ‘Cats’ air attack? Furlong: Utah has been tested most of the season against heavy-passing offenses and has fared well against these teams. Losing Sione Vaki and Cole Bishop will be a big blow to the team but they have proven guys in Nate Ritchie and Tao Johnson that have provided some great depth for the team and have some experience to fill in. It’s safe to assume this is the area Utah will struggle with most on defense — it certainly won’t be the same as the regular season — but this is arguably the deepest team Kyle Whittingham has had on defense. If something does go wrong though this is where I predict it happening. INU: Northwestern’s weak point is its offensive line. Even without Jonah Elliss who do the ‘Cats need to look out for from Utah’s pass rush? Furlong: Defensive end might be one of Utah’s deepest position groups with a handful of guys that have experience. Utah will rely on Van Fillinger and Connor O’Toole who both have a lot of starter experience. Fillinger has been a three-year starter and is disruptive but not incredibly quick. On the other side of the line is O’Toole who is considered the best pass rusher on the team — at least that’s what coaches said before the season. O’Toole battled injury for much of the season before joining the team late in the year but is coming into regular form. INU: Despite Utah having more opt-outs it is still favored by nearly a touchdown. What is your prediction for the game? Furlong:  It’s difficult to predict bowl games especially with how many players have transferred opted out or are injured for Utah. But with that said I think if Utah can establish the run and find some success in the passing game they’re capable of winning by a touchdown or more. To me it all depends on the effort level of this team though. When Utah is engaged and playing for something they’ve been tough to beat — as evidenced by a close game against Washington. But if Utah goes through the motions and doesn’t come out firing — much like they did after a loss to Washington — I have a tough time seeing Utah coming away with a win. Obviously Northwestern will have a say in all this too but that’s looking at it from a Utah angle. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Less than 10 days ago Northwestern was reeling. The Wildcats had just lost by 25 to DePaul at home extending their losing streak to six games (including the program’s first ever defeat at the hands of Loyola Chicago). The streak was snapped thanks to a 20-point home victory over Bradley and yesterday’s 72-68 win over Temple gave the team its first winning streak since Nov. 12. Here are three takeaways from the team’s encouraging comeback victory. The defense is heading in the right direction Temple guard Aleah Nelson walked into the gym on Wednesday shooting 37% from the field on the season. She left the gym shooting at 35%. Her 5-of-20 day was emblematic of the Owls’ offensive struggles the entire day. Temple as a team shot just 31% for the game failing to find the net on 56 of their 81 shots. Aside from Rayne Tucker who shot 8-of-15 not a single Owls player finished the game shooting above 35%. If the Owls didn’t grab 27 offensive rebounds then the stats on the offensive end would have looked even worse. Temple’s shooting struggles didn’t just happen. The insertion of first-year Casey Harter into the starting lineup gives the team four starters all listed at 5-foot-11 or taller (and Caroline Lau the fifth starter is 5-foot-9). That added length made life very difficult for Temple on the offensive end especially late in the shot clock when the offensive system broke down. The Wildcats totaled six blocks and four steals but the impact of the improved defense can’t be fully measured by the stat sheet. The biggest proof of the defense working: Temple’s collapse in the second half. The Owls converted eight of their 18 field goals in the first half a respectable mark of 44.4%. After the break though the Owls crashed back down to earth. Temple made just five of its 26 second-half shots an anemic mark of 19.2% (and no that’s not a typo). After the defense’s struggles in late November and earlier this month these last two results are very encouraging. This is the second consecutive game the Wildcats have held their opponents under 70 points and also the second consecutive game they’ve won. That’s not an accident. The rebounding is...not Let’s travel back to the first paragraph of last section: “If the Owls didn’t grab 27 offensive rebounds then the stats on the offensive end would have looked even worse.” Unfortunately that stat is also not a typo. Temple missed 56 shots from the field and yet 27 times the basketball found its way back into the hands of a crimson-clad player. Even though Northwestern came away with the victory a stat like that cannot happen. Unfortunately that stat is part of a much larger trend. Since Nov. 22 one month ago today the Wildcats have played eight games. They have been out-rebounded in seven of those games with the margin being -5 or larger each time. What does that add up to? A team dead last in the Big Ten in rebounding margin at -2.1 per game. Wisconsin is the only other Big Ten squad that currently “boasts” a negative rebounding differential for the season. And the struggles stopping offensive rebounds? Those aren’t new either as the Wildcats have given up double digit offensive rebounds in 11 of their 12 contests. ""Needless to say this is one habit the Wildcats will look to kick in the new year. They really dont have any other choice: the Big Ten currently has nine teams in the top 100 nationally in rebounding margin including five in the top 50. In its lone Big Ten contest so far (a tight loss to Maryland) Northwestern lost the rebounding battle by nine. That mark included 19 offensive rebounds given up. If the Wildcats are going to be any sort of competitive in the conference they have to start cleaning up the glass. "" Casey Harter the newest starter The Pennsylvanian point guard didn’t exactly have an auspicious start to her collegiate career. Harter played just six minutes in her first career game against UIC didn’t score until her third career game and only received double digit minutes in blowouts against Notre Dame and Florida State. At least that was the case until she put up 12 points in 29 minutes (both second-most on the team) in the loss to Belmont. Since then she’s earned the trust of both the coaching staff and her teammates and the result is four consecutive starts. Harter has tallied 30 or more minutes in five of the six games since that Belmont contest and after starting her first career game against Maryland she hasn’t looked back. She’s led the team in minutes in three of the last four games and would have done it against Temple as well had Lau not played 37 minutes. Why has Joe McKeown put so much trust and responsibility on a first year? Because Harter has earned it. She’s scored in double figures in five of her last seven games Despite her relative inexperience she’s showcased a great basketball mind as evidenced by her 1.85 assist to turnover ratio (second highest on the team). Over her four starts (the last four games) Harter has upped her averages from 5.3 points 2.3 rebounds and 1.0 assists per game to 7.0 3.2 and 2.0. Much like Lau last year Harter has earned a spot thanks to both her poise and her overall play. McKeown and the rest of the staff hope she can continue doing so as Big Ten play kicks into high gear.    \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story After nearly a month away Northwestern returns to the gridiron for a Las Vegas Bowl clash with the Utah Utes. Will the ‘Cats prevail over Kyle Whittingham’s side for the second time in five years out west? Here’s what our staffers foresee. Iggy Dowling: Utah 17 Northwestern 13 No matter how weird it is that Bryson Barnes is actually going to play in this game it’s the wrong alternate game for Mike Bajakian. Bradley Locker: Northwestern 27 Utah 19 Utah has been ravaged by the transfer portal and NFL Draft on both sides with marquee losses including two-way star Sione Vaki Devaughn Vele and two starting offensive linemen. Meanwhile the Wildcats have remained largely intact and should start 21 of their typical 22 primary players. If Ben Bryant and Northwestern’s pass offense can get clicking against a weaker-than-usual secondary — plus if the ‘Cats can contain Ja’Quinden Jackson and the returning Micah Bernard — then David Braun should be able to pull through. After all the Utes are 1-4 this year when allowing more than 17 points and Northwestern did that in nine games. David Gold: Northwestern 27 Utah 13 The answer is very simple. Northwestern remains intact for the game while the Utes will be trotting out a shell of their roster. Without star safeties Sione Vaki and Cole Bishop I think the Utes will struggle to stop the ‘Cats’ receiving corps. In Ben Bryant’s final collegiate game Mike Bajakian will air the ball out. On the other hand Bryson Barnes has one foot out the door in Salt Lake City so the motivation factor for Utah seems low.  Adam Beck: Northwestern 24 Utah 17 In an early regular season non-conference game I’m taking the Utes every day of the week. But without a couple of their best pass catchers both starting safeties and two starters on the offensive line to name just a couple of impact players that won’t suit up on Saturday I like Northwestern’s chances. The ‘Cats are still riding high off a Land of Lincoln trophy-winning performance and have the offensive firepower to win with the passing game. Plus Northwestern has won its last four bowl games Utah’s dropped its last four (three of four against Big Ten competition) and the ‘Cats lead the all time series between the two squads 2-1. Either way the matchup will be dictated by Northwestern’s run defense allowing a Big Ten-worst 159.5 yards per game vs a Utah run game averaging 186.3 yards a contest. If the ‘Cats can stop the run and win up front of offense they’ve got this one in the bag. Ascher Levin: Northwestern 21 Utah 17 After a month of practice in preparation for the Las Vegas Bowl Northwestern will look to win its fourth game in a row to close out the season. Utah is a strong opponent; however the Utes will be missing many key contributors. They won’t have Devaughn Vele their best receiver and Cole Bishop an NFL-caliber safety. The team also won’t have star safety/running back Sione Vaki who declared for the draft. Northwestern will be able to exploit Utah’s secondary. Even though quarterback Bryson Barnes is playing he’s in the transfer portal  which could cause issues with team chemistry. Defensively the Wildcats will have to limit Barnes and Ja’Quinden Jackson in the run game. Utah won’t have Vele or Mikey Matthews the team’s third best receiver and will most likely utilize the ground game more than usual. While Utah is favored to win I think the ‘Cats will prevail and finish their season on a high note. Natalie Wells: Northwestern 24 Utah 23 The ‘Cats will face a Utah team decimated by the transfer portal and NFL Draft. The Utes rushed for the 26th-most yards per game in the FBS but they’re missing an explosive athlete in Sione Vaki. Ben Bryant will sling it for over 200 passing yards for just the fourth time this season as NU captures it eighth and final win. Brendan Preisman: Utah 24 Northwestern 21 After I saw the script helmets on Twitter I was extremely tempted to roll with the Wildcats all the way. But unfortunately for Northwestern Utah has very good vibes as well. This Utes team is only 8-4 but those four losses are all to teams currently ranked in the Top 25 (and three of them are in the Top 15). The “pig farmer” quarterback Bryson Barnes (who not so quietly outplayed Caleb Williams when Utah toppled USC in late October) is staying for the bowl game and that is the main reason I’m picking against the ‘Cats. It’ll be fun it’ll be close and the Wildcats will cover. But this Utes team might be one of the three most talented squads Northwestern has faced all year and that’s why I think the ‘Cats (much like me at the slot machines) will leave Vegas on a loss.

Share this story Happy Holidays! With the Las Vegas Bowl finally here it’s a great time ton answer questions about all things Northwestern (and non-Northwestern). Here they are: @yyanli1: How do you think Northwestern women’s basketball will fare in Big Ten play and what do they need to do to stand a fighting chance? ""David: It is not going to be pretty for the ‘Cats in Big Ten play. To have a fighting chance NU needs to play clean basketball but I just dont see that happening."" Iggy: If the non-conference slate showed any indication it’s not going to be great. Most of the younger returning starters from 2022-23 just haven’t shown enough improvement overall to warrant a ton of optimism.  Competing in the Big Ten consistently starts with playing defense which NU has struggled at mightily. As of Dec. 22 its defensive rating is the sixth-worst in all of Division I. While Hailey Weaver and Mel Daley have solid steal totals it’s not that reflective of the team’s perimeter defense from the eye test. Someone like Rutgers’ Kaylene Smikle who is coming to Evanston next Saturday could easily light up the ‘Cats by beating defenders off the dribble (which Northwestern has often failed to do). Limiting turnovers and paint points from the opposition could go a long way as the competition quickly gets stiffer.  Bradley: It’s hard to say anything other than what David and Iggy have already posited; I don’t have much faith in Northwestern to earnestly remain competitive against conference competition. The ‘Cats don’t appear to really have made any substantive progress through their first 12 games of the season with turnovers and shooting remaining critical issues. Another slate finishing 2-16 or so seems likely unless NU gets significant contributions from Caroline Lau and Caileigh Walsh. @_kaylacohen: If you had to buy one NIL merch item from a Northwestern player what would you choose?  David: I want a Gus the Bus jersey so badly. Iggy: Give me a Kelsey Nader jersey. Buy stock now because that price is gonna explode fast come February. Bradley: I’d spend ungodly amounts on Jack Olsen’s Milkman shirt donned by Marshall Lang on the way to Sin City. @dejecteddat: Who will play the most snaps at quarterback for the cats in the ‘24 season? David: I think Bradley and I agree that Northwestern’s starting quarterback in 2024 is not currently on the roster. Northwestern’s most successful seasons in the last five years were guided by a grad transfer so I think David Braun looks in that same direction this offseason. After the last two seasons I do not believe that Brendan Sullivan is a viable option to keep the ‘Cats competitive in the new Big Ten. Unless Jack Lausch or Aidan Gray ball out in spring ball I expect a transfer to start under center next season. Bradley: For as much as I think Sullivan has legitimate dual-threat talent he really has not been able to put it together across two seasons of sizeable starting experience. His outings against Nebraska Howard and Iowa do not induce much confidence in a full-time starting role whatsoever. I fully expect NU to look to the portal — if for nothing else but depth — moving into the start of the 2024 season yet again. @wildcatsnetwrk: What is the spark that northwestern basketball is missing this year? David: Someone who can grab a rebound without fouling. Iggy: It’s the answer that most know and don’t want to hear: a lockdown perimeter defender. Having one makes it so much easier for Northwestern to play its slow-paced brand of basketball and not just win but thrive. Many of these non-conference games have been close because opposing guards have been able to score at high clips early in the game which prevents NU from often running away. Whether it’s Ty Berry or Ryan Langborg (and frankly Berry has a much better chance of becoming that guy) a wing player is going to have to become a consistently great wing defender for NU to be competitive in the Big Ten. Bradley: In a lot of ways it’s the same as last year: a consistent reliable No. 2 scoring option. Boo Buie will pretty much show up and contribute on a nightly basis but outside of him Brooks Barnhizer has probably been the largest Robin — posting 10+ points in 10 of 11 games. However when Buie is made the focal point by a defense in a big moment it still doesn’t seem as if someone is to be counted on to drill that game-leading shot. As Iggy noted the game-to-game variance of Langborg and Berry will decide much of the season because it seriously feels like NU will need one or two of its Core Four to flourish if it wants to contend down the stretch. phatcat: Is there any timeline as to when we will learn where the FB team will play home games next year? David: There is so much still in the air with Ryan Field. Opposition movements filed a lawsuit to prevent the zoning from going into effect. If the lawsuit is successful the project is dead.  Otherwise I would expect to hear something in the spring. Sloth Astronuat: odds we got the NDSU OC since he was passed over for HC? Bradley: I would say they’re not zero but probably somewhat unlikely. According to ESPN’s Adam Rittenberg NDSU still wants to keep Tyler Roehl though an offer from fellow Bison assistant Braun and Northwestern would almost definitely be too gilded to pass up. You can’t argue with production either given that Roehl’s unit has exceeded 34 offensive points per game over the last three seasons. At the same time for as much as Braun loves his FCS guys I don’t know if Derrick Gragg would fully endorse having multiple coordinators jumping from the FCS to Big Ten level. Additionally I feel that one of the top traits that both Braun and Gragg will pursue is a coach that can adequately develop a young quarterback because that has been sorely lacking in Mike Bajakian’s tenure. Trey Lance and Cam Miller both ended up being solid for North Dakota State but neither was a true world-beater — plus Roehl oversaw tight ends/fullbacks and less so QBs. NU ‘06er:  My mailbag question is: Can you offer some insight into how you interpret site moderation? (Frankly the commentariat seems like it needs a refresher.) Best I can tell the rules nominally include categorical prohibitions on: Personal attacks discriminatory/derogatory language wishing harm on athletes disinformation illegality NSFW images/commentary excessive profanity multiple accounts trolling and spam — summarized as: That all seems good on paper. But it doesn’t seem like there’s actual clarity as to what constitutes trolling what constitutes a personal attack or what constitutes being respectful/being a jerk. Is it trolling to keep repeating the same arguments for more than a half-dozen threads? Is it a personal attack/disrespectful jerk-ishness to respond to that familiar talking point with ad hominem? I’ve pretty purposefully not included citations to any specific individuals doing either of those things here but I suspect it will fit too close for comfort for some what I am referring to. I can tell you from my own experience I was surprised that my telling NSCat he should try Twitter if his attention span wasn’t greater than 140 characters wasn’t a violation (it was a jerkish thing of me to say even if mild for an online flame war if we’re honest) — but quoting what NSCat said to me back to him somehow was. The specifics of any past thread matter less to me than an understanding of what the rules are here going forward. Might not be a bad conversation to revisit with this mailbag in the spirit of turning a page to the new year. David: To be honest I avoid the comment section like the plague. My only thing is be nice to each other do not call each other names and be respectful. At the end of the day everyone in the comments cares about Northwestern whether you agree with their opinion or not. Iggy: I personally find the trolling here hilarious and annoying at the same time (yes getting to 100 comments on an article off one thread is trolling). The simplest answer to this without copy-pasting guidelines is that we can’t stop it unless lines are crossed. I think we all know where that generally is (going from the sports intelligence side to the very personal side). Don’t approach that line. Bradley: Fully second what David and Iggy said but I will add that that even though we as EICs largely don’t have an active role in monitoring comments we’re always amenable to questions that may arise about comment categorization by Vox’s system (and pretty much any other topic too). NUDave: Does NU get serious about getting on the NIL train for any of its sports? Bradley: The superficial answer is one can only hope so. Football is the clearest-cut sport in which Northwestern is actively not competing as well as it could be because of its NIL structure. Monitoring pretty much every other Power Five team in the country it’s hard not to think that NU is still light years behind in NIL and how it’s implemented. At the same time the principle of TrueNU — Northwestern’s NIL collective — is to allow athletes to maximize their compensation opportunities while actively benefitting surrounding communities. It feels improbable that TrueNU would suddenly pivot from that altruistic perspective to one fostering pay for play — especially in football where Braun clearly delineated that he wants NIL and football to be separate. My best guess is that we may see a more proactive NIL approach in sports like field hockey and lacrosse where a) NU is consistently dominant and b) athletes have already explored sponsorships. AyanKB: 1st off - Happy Holidays. To see how many writers from Sippin On Purple and InsideNU have gone onto success at Washington Post Yahoo Sports Fox Sports ESPN etc is incredible. Thank you for your coverage and avenue for the 1% of NU fans to have an online community. What is the plan with NU WBB’s HC position? Joe McK has been awful and some new blood is needed. Is there an Assistant Coach on the staff that could be a successor? Iggy: First off a sincere thanks and happy holidays to you and yours. As many know Joe McKeown’s contract runs through 2024-25. Barring a worse season than last year I think McKeown stays in Evanston for the full two seasons. While Northwestern finds itself in the depths of a rebuild his recruiting has remained solid (i.e. getting two top-60 2024 recruits in Xamiya Walton and Tayla Thomas). McKeown’s assistants have had a history of earning head-coaching jobs which suggests that there’s a good chance NU can hit on his potential successor. Look no further than Kate Popovec-Goss (Bradley) and Allison Guth (Loyola). Tangela Smith as the associate head coach with a great deal of experience (and a coaching member of that 2020-21 team) seems to be the clear No. 2 What is the plan for NU WVB HC I? A current B1G Assistant Coach? noah_weintraub: “Thoughts on the Northwestern secondary this year?” Bradley: Overall relatively strong. Devin Turner had a really good second season in defending both the pass and run notching an 84 run defense and 82 tackling grade from PFF — though his few dropped interceptions were an area for growth. When healthy Coco Azema was his usual thumping run-stopping self and his interception of Taulia Tagovailoa was monumental in sealing the win over Maryland. At corner Garnett Hollis Jr. was pretty solid notching an 87.7 NFL passer rating allowed — though his five penalties were somewhat costly; I wouldn’t be surprised if he got a decent number of NFL looks given his frame and experience. Theran Johnson still has room to grow on a down-to-down basis but he had bright moments including against Iowa. I’d be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge the contributions of Jaheem Joseph too: he was major against Wisconsin and made impact plays in other games as a relief safety.      \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n]",[],0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story As the whistle sounded after Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham signaled for his third and final timeout Northwestern faced a third-and-7 — a proposition that the Wildcats have struggled with for much of the season and a down on which they sat 6-for-16 on the night. Indeed anything offensive on either side was far from a guarantee. With the Las Vegas Bowl hanging in the balance NU quarterback Ben Bryant took the snap surveyed the Utes’ defense scampered out of the pocket and catapulted past the marker. As his feet left the ground he was met by Utah safety Nate Ritchie; after he was stopped he stayed on the Allegiant Stadium turf clutching his shoulder. Yet in tow was the Las Vegas Bowl trophy for Northwestern. In pretty much any other circumstance one would be incredibly concerned about Bryant’s status given that he’s NU’s top quarterback and a team catalyst. But not this one. Indeed the clutch play envelops so much of Northwestern’s unbelievable season: putting everything on the line even when nobody figures there’s a chance to do so. Around 10 minutes prior Bryant was hit hard on another run seemingly concussed after displaying signs of the fencing position. The Wildcats’ starter left the game and air was vacuumed out of the Raiders’ $1.9-billion stadium from those donning purple. A failed fourth-and-7 try shortly thereafter left most anticipating a Utah win in a tie matchup. But if you know this Northwestern team you knew that was never a real possibility. Like Criss Angel himself Bryant miraculously exited the blue tent jogged over to the sideline grabbed his helmet and re-entered the game on NU’s next possession — even Angel himself may have been impressed. What Bryant did is what Northwestern players coaches and fans have grown accustomed to: lead a three-play 53-yard drive to give the ‘Cats a lead that they wouldn’t relinquish. Northwestern’s fifth straight bowl game win was anything but breathtaking. The Wildcats didn’t cross the 300-yard mark were outgained by nearly nine minutes in the time-of-possession battle missed two field goals and scored on just two of nine drives entering Utah territory. But when the game hung in the balance David Braun’s side simply executed when it needed to — be it Bryant finding Bryce Kirtz to score from 19 yards away or halting two straight Utes fourth-down tries. That sentiment in and of itself is the defining creed of Braun’s first year in Evanston one which saw NU amass 8+ wins for the first time since 2018 and finish the season on a four-game winning streak. Whether in the final game of its season — where just 9% of ESPN Bowl Mania predictors foresaw a win for the purple and white — or from the start — in which few envisioned the ‘Cats exceeding three wins Braun’s bunch was never content with a token win in America or a lone Big Ten victory. As players chanted after the game receipts were kept and truthfully shredded triumphantly. In countless ways so many moments from Northwestern’s 2023 campaign felt straight out of an Oscar-winning script — including lifting a trophy to close things out of course. For all of the peculiarities and idiosyncrasies along the way (of which there were many) though Braun’s inaugural year represents exactly what the Wildcats should strive to be on a yearly basis. Under Pat Fitzgerald NU’s program experienced never-before-seen highs such as sustained bowl game success and even top-10 rankings in the eyes of the College Football Playoff committee. But for all of the summits the nadirs of languid seasons like 2019 2021 and 2022 created vicissitudes that prevented Northwestern from meeting its top potential. With Braun now at the helm the most important element might not be NIL the use of the transfer portal or where the ‘Cats will call home in 2024. Instead there’s a real argument that it’s avoiding disastrous wasted campaigns. Of course it’s significantly easier said than done to follow a smooth trajectory like that; plus leveraging resources like the portal and strong recruiting overlap greatly with more seasons of at least six wins. But when one really breaks down why Northwestern succeeded these last four months it doesn’t feel overwhelmingly impossible to replicate. Seasoned quarterback play elevating an offense when it matters most. A solid group of pass-catchers that can make tough receptions and conversions when necessary. An opportunistic defense that thrives on fourth down and in capitalizing on turnover chances. And most critically a coaching staff that harnesses every ounce of talent on its roster and caters play style to player traits. A slew of teams around the country aim to follow that exact blueprint every year and fall well short. In fact Northwestern would have clamored for that combination in the three aforementioned futile seasons it suffered recently. At the end of the day though that’s what spurred this remarkable season one that began to feel far less fluky when realizing this team’s capabilities. No the Wildcats can’t just stand idly this offseason and expect a replica. Other teams in the conference (see Indiana Nebraska etc.) are already vastly improved in an 18-team battle royale. A lot of times too Northwestern won games on the margins despite having very poor showings for long periods on one or more sides of the ball. Regression is probably to be expected in the short-term future. Yet the team has already recognized some of its weaknesses and made crucial forward-thinking decisions. Braun zeroed in on staff changes including moving on from embattled OC Mike Bajakian and promoting LBs coach Tim McGarigle to DC per ESPN’s Sean McDonough. Adding an impactful nucleus through the portal is probably the next step in that department. Fundamentally Northwestern will probably never experience a season like it just did ever again. Its enduring images however — of beating rivals rallying its community and hoisting glimmering trophies — doesn’t feel like too high of a standard. In fact it’s what Braun must establish as the yearly goal for Northwestern as it seeks to remain relevant in a college football landscape that in all honestly almost aims to overlook programs like NU. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story As Northwestern’s improbable season has officially come to a close Inside NU will spend the next few weeks wrapping up our coverage of the 2023 football season. Today we will start our review of each position group starting with the quarterbacks.  After a thrilling bowl victory over Utah in Las Vegas it seems safe to say that the Northwestern Wildcats are officially the most improved FBS team in the nation. Following a 1-11 2022 campaign and a hazing scandal that shook the entire program the ‘Cats kept finding ways to overcome the adversity that stared them in the face all season long. Led by first-time FBS head coach David Braun they didn’t just improve their 2022 win total by seven — the largest figure in FBS — but they reinstilled hope into the Northwestern football program. Heading into the season the future for Northwestern football looked bleak. Now there is a novel excitement surrounding the program — a world of possibilities.  Perhaps the biggest improvement from last season came at the quarterback position. In 2022 the lack of production and consistency at QB was a major reason for the team’s struggles. While far from perfect in 2023 this year’s quarterback room told a far different story. While it took a few starts for Ben Bryant to get rolling he eventually provided Northwestern with the answer it had been searching for at the QB position. Unlike last year offensive coordinator Mike Bajakian could trust his passing game and do damage through the air. While Bryant’s clutch gene and his knack for winning made him the perfect starter for this Northwestern team Brendan Sullivan’s contribution was also significant as he kept the ship afloat while Bryant was out injured. Only a junior Sullivan may still very well be in the mix at the quarterback position next year.  It may seem obvious but there may be no position more important in football than quarterback so when trying to turn a team around it is crucial to get the quarterback position right. This year thanks to Ben Bryant and Brendan Sullivan the ‘Cats did just that.  Stats: 173-for-277 1807 passing yards 13 touchdowns six interceptions 19 carries 135 rushing yards four rushing touchdowns With sixth-year Cincinnati product Ben Bryant slated to start at the onset of the 2023 season there was cautious optimism surrounding the position. Bryant had just come off a career-best season in Cincy leading the Bearcats to a 9-2 record and a No. 22 spot in the AP poll before he was sidelined with a foot injury. Coming into Evanston through the transfer portal he brought more talent and experience than Northwestern had under center in quite some time.  So when his Wildcat debut against Rutgers turned into an absolute disaster — reminiscent of Northwestern’s QB play from last year — there was cause for concern. He barely completed 50% of his passes threw two interceptions and the offense looked as stagnant as ever. Northwestern lost the game 24-7 — a troubling start to the season.  The next few weeks didn’t get much better for Bryant. NU beat UTEP on a ground-heavy offensive performance and was destroyed by Duke on another subpar Bryant outing. Three weeks into the season the questions at quarterback remained unanswered for the ‘Cats.  It wasn’t until Northwestern’s unbelievable comeback against Minnesota that Wildcat fans could feel confident about No.2. The ‘Cats clawed back overcoming a 21-point deficit in the fourth quarter to win the game in overtime. The hero? Ben Bryant. Finishing with four touchdowns and nearly 400 passing yards the first Wildcat QB to throw four TD in a game since 2013. He controlled the offense with calm confidence in the late stages making a few spectacular throws (including the game-winner to Charlie Mangieri) to help Northwestern finish on top.   Just as Bryant hit the turning point the ‘Cats had been waiting for he hit the injured list leaving the game against No. 6 Penn State when he hit the ground hard on his right shoulder. The injury sidelined the sixth year for over a month.  When he came back to face Wisconsin at Camp Randall Stadium it looked as if the veteran hadn’t missed a beat. He led Northwestern to a massive 24-10 victory and kept the ‘Cats rolling into the later part of the season. In the last three games of the regular season Bryant led Northwestern to three consecutive victories including when the Wildcats reclaimed the HAT against Illinois. With Bryant’s steady hand at the helm Northwestern didn’t only reach a bowl game — but it took home the trophy in Las Vegas against a Utah team that entered the season ranked No. 14 and hadn’t lost to an unranked opponent all season. Bryant’s performance in Las Vegas was one for the ages and served as a microcosm of No. 2’s time as a Wildcat.  In the Las Vegas Bowl Bryant threw for 222 yards for 2 TDs while completing about 67% of his passes. While those were very good numbers on a postseason stage the value of his performance went beyond the numbers. With 11:24 remaining in regulation the score tied at 7-7 Bryant hit the deck hard and it looked like his day — and his college career —  could be over. Somehow just minutes later he was back under center for the ‘Cats making some of his biggest and best throws of the season with the game on the line.  He nailed A.J. Henning on a deep ball to set the Wildcats up in the red zone and put the perfect touch on a TD throw in the corner of the end zone to Bryce Kirtz to give Northwestern the lead. Putting himself on the line Bryant stayed stoic on one of the most pivotal drives of the season just as he had all season long. Although he only spent one season as a Wildcat Ben Bryant certainly left a lasting legacy of success at Northwestern.  Stats: 63-for-99 714 passing yards six touchdowns two interceptions 30 carries 270 rushing yards four rushing touchdowns Although he served a backup role to Bryant Brendan Sullivan had about as much action this year as he had in 2022 mostly coming from his four-game starting stint during Bryant’s absence during October. For the most part Sullivan was reliable — he limited turnovers (only throwing one interception during those four games) made good decisions with the football and proved to be dangerous on the ground as well.  On paper Sullivan’s numbers are just as good or better than Bryant’s considering the smaller sample size — Sullivan finished with better marks in completion percentage passer rating and TD-INT ratio. As I mentioned before though numbers do not tell the whole story. During Sullivan’s time as Bryant’s replacement the ‘Cats went 2-2. That’s not bad on the surface but many Wildcat fans felt that if Bryant were healthy for those four games Northwestern could’ve been 4-0 on that stretch.  Sullivan’s first start of the season came against Howard a game in which Northwestern nearly lost to an FCS program. Despite the 23-20 final score it was smooth sailing for the first three-quarters of the game. Sullivan danced his way to a 35-yard rushing touchdown on the opening drive and was able to lead NU to a 16-point lead. However as soon as the game reached the fourth the offense stagnated. Sullivan made no glaring mistakes and still finished with solid statistics but the offense didn’t have that same killer instinct that it had under Bryant. Northwestern wasn’t able to properly close out the game and narrowly escaped with a win. The dormant offense continued into their road game the following week in Lincoln. Sullivan had his worst game of the season and in what turned out to be a one-possession Northwestern loss many wondered what the result would’ve been had Bryant been under center. The pleas for Bryant’s return were growing louder and louder. Still Bryant remained on the sidelines and Sullivan trotted back out as the starter against Maryland. Unlike his lackluster showing in Lincoln the junior flipped the script delivering the best performance of his career. He went off for 265 passing yards and two passing TDs adding over 50 yards on the ground as well. He displayed talent we had seen in flashes only this time he was finally putting it all together.  Sullivan’s last action of the season came in Northwestern’s heartbreaking loss against Iowa at Wrigley Field — the last game before Bryant’s eventual return. Facing the infamous Iowa defense Sullivan fared alright — avoiding turnovers and even connecting on a few deep throws. While the loss was certainly not on Sullivan alone the offense once again struggled to move the ball leaving many to wonder how the result would’ve been different if Bryant had been at the helm. While Sullivan’s season certainly left a little to be desired it should still be considered a success. He delivered exactly what was asked of him as Bryant’s backup — he played clean kept the team in games and even surprised with a few highlight plays every now and again.   Stats: 2-for-4 88 passing yards one touchdown 0 interceptions Ryan Hillinski’s career has certainly not lived up to expectations. In 2019 he started for South Carolina as a freshman thanks to an injury at quarterback. He wasn’t incredible but was serviceable to a decent team in the SEC. He was benched the following season and soon thereafter hit the transfer portal landing in Evanston. He started a few games in 2021 and earned the full-time gig in 2022. It was short-lived however as subpar performance led to a change at the QB position. To make matters worse a significant knee injury at the end of 2022 took Hilinski out of most of the preseason. In 2023 Hilinski found himself third on the depth chart and threw just four passes. His first of the season went for 85 yards and a TD but the result was much thanks to Joseph Himon II’s 80+ yard catch-and-run on the dump-off screen. His next three passes all came in the Las Vegas Bowl against Utah while Ben Bryant was being evaluated for an injury — two of those landing nowhere near their intended targets. There was once a day when Hilinski seemed to be the Wildcat QB for the foreseeable future but that day is far in the past now.  Stats: 2-for-3 68 passing yards 0 touchdowns 0 interceptions 19 carries 80 rushing yards As essentially the fourth-string QB for Northwestern Jack Lausch made himself useful by being the exclusive ‘wildcat’ quarterback for the Wildcats. If Lausch took the field in the shotgun it was almost certainly going to be a designed QB run. While he only found the endzone once Lausch’s presence threw an interesting wrinkle in the Mike Bajakian offense.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story With the opportunity to watch almost two months of non-conference play a couple squads have cemented themselves as bonafide teams to watch while others have taken a tumble from their preseason expectations. Now thanks to the looming gauntlet of Big Ten games approaching (plus a few we’ve already been lucky enough to watch) there’s no better holiday gift than diving into our first in-season Big Ten power rankings of the year. Record: 11-1 (1-1 B1G) Next Game: vs. Eastern Kentucky Purdue is still the Big Ten’s benchmark. The No. 1 team in the country’s only blemish is its 92-88 overtime loss to Northwestern on Dec. 1. Nonetheless Zach Edey is still the best player in college basketball averaging an absurd 24.0 points and 10.4 rebounds per contest. Braden Smith with his 13.3 points 6.7 assists and 5.5 rebounds per game is a top-three ball-handler in the Big Ten. With wins against ranked Arizona Marquette Tennessee and Gonzaga the Boilermakers aren’t just the Big Ten’s most dangerous team but the country’s. Record: 9-2 (1-0 B1G) Next Game: vs. FDU Minus a seven point loss to Tennessee on the road Illinois has been incredibly impressive over the past month. Terrance Shannon’s natural scoring abilities paired with the offensive talent of Marcus Domask Quincy Guerrier and Coleman Hawkins gives Illinois an offense that can compete with anyone. Just look at the Fighting Illini’s thrilling 98-89 win at Madison Square Garden over ranked FAU as a flash of what this squad is capable of. However a concern for Brad Underwood’s squad is a 0.99 team turnover-to-assist ratio. If Illinois learns how to share the rock and take care of the ball in conference play it is the clear second rung on the Big Ten ladder. Record: 9-3 (1-0 B1G) Next Game: vs. Iowa Outside of their three losses on the season — all to great teams in Tennessee Arizona and Providence — the Badgers have been impressive. Wisconsin beat an elite Marquette team at the Kohl Center and tallied their first Big Ten win of the season on the road at Michigan State. Led by St. John’s transfer AJ Storr’s 15.0 points per game the Badgers have five players averaging nine-plus points per contest. Their core is experienced too with Steven Crowl Tyler Wahl Chucky Hepburn and Max Klesmit all playing over 25 minutes per game. If Greg Gard can get the Badgers off to a hot start in January Wisconsin will cement itself as one of the teams to beat in the Big Ten. Record: 9-2 (1-0 B1G) Next Game: vs. Jackson State With arguably the best win in college basketball this year over top-ranked Purdue the ‘Cats also have one of the country’s worst losses to Chicago State. However with a big bounce-back win against Arizona State in Phoenix Northwestern showed it’s back on track thanks to its physicality hustle and methodical play. Boo Buie’s 18.5 points per game has Agent Zero as the conference’s best clutch scorer but look for the supporting cast of Brooks Barnhizer Ryan Langborg and Ty Berry to dictate wins and losses. No matter the opponent Chris Collins’ squad finds itself in close games — already playing five contests with margins of five points or less within five minutes left of regulation. If the ‘Cats can continue to be clutch nail triples and improve on the glass their drive and fight every single play has them as a top-five Big Ten team. Record: 10-2 (1-1 B1G) Next Game: vs. West Virginia Bruce Thornton’s sophomore jump paired with Jameson Battle’s transfer from Minnesota has elevated the Buckeyes to a hot start in non-conference play. Thornton is averaging 17.4 points and 4.1 assists per game while Battle’s 41.9 percent shooting from deep has ignited an Ohio State offense that ranks in the top half of the Big Ten. Don’t forget about Roddy Gayle Jr. or Zed Key either — who are both double-digit scorers. Playing West Virginia on Saturday will be another good test but with a conference win against Minnesota and good victories over Alabama and UCLA Ohio State is primed to finish better than its 5-15 record in conference play from a season ago. Record: 7-5 (0-2 B1G) Next Game: vs. Indiana State Michigan State’s season has been filled with twists turns and surprises. After losing to James Madison in their opener the Spartans dropped big time matchups to ranked Arizona and Duke teams and lost their first two conference games to Wisconsin and Nebraska. But a win over No. 6 Baylor a week ago changed the feel of this Michigan State squad. Tyson Walker is one of the Big Ten’s best closers averaging 19.8 points per contest and with AJ Hoggard and Jaden Akins contributing double-digit points per game Tom Izzo’s squad is a win-streak away from vaulting up the power rankings. Indiana State is not an opponent to look past making the Spartans’ upcoming matchup a good gauge of where this team is at. The Spartans have the talent but they need to find consistency with the thick of conference play right around the corner.  Record: 9-3 (2-0 B1G) Next Game: vs. Kennesaw State Indiana losing Jalen Hood-Schifino and Trayce Jackson-Davis in the offseason had many fans uncertain what Mike Woodson’s Hoosiers would look like. Led by Trey Galloway Kel’el Ware and Malik Reneau the Hoosiers scream being a feisty Big Ten team with their size and physicality. Throw in impact freshman Mackenzie Mgbako who’s improving each game he plays in and the Hoosiers are a sneaky team to make some noise in conference play. They lost badly to Auburn but they are the only Big Ten team with two conference wins having already beaten Maryland and Michigan and played Kansas to the end in a heart-breaking loss at home. With its ability to play with two athletic bigs in Ware and Reneau that both average nearly 15 points per game Indiana’s size poses a matchup nightmare to smaller Big Ten lineups. Record: 10-2 (1-1 B1G) Next Game: vs. SC State The eight slot may be a little low for the Cornhuskers after an incredible start to the season. Though they began the campaign on a seven-game win streak a loss to Creighton and a second-half meltdown to Minnesota on the road to open conference play have led to questions about the Cornhuskers’ legitimacy. Wins over Michigan State and Kansas State have quieted the doubters but even then it’s unclear if Nebraska has what it takes to keep up with the top dogs in the conference. However with Juwan Gary Keisei Tominaga Brice Williams and Rienk Mast — who’ll give Nebraska a huge lift when he returns from a knee injury — all averaging 13-plus points per game Nebraska has the weapons to finish better than its 16-16 record last year and potentially make the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2014. Record: 6-6 (1-1 B1G) Next Game: vs. McNeese State Michigan being in the nine spot might feel a little high for the Wolverines who have had their fair share of struggles this season. Unable to win close games — with five of Michigan’s six losses being by six or fewer points — Dug McDaniel’s 19.2 points per game has Michigan as the Big Ten’s third-best scoring offense. But the barometer of success for the Wolverines will be Tennessee transfer Olivier Nkahmhoua’s play. The athletic forward excels with his back to the basket and is a force on the boards. He’s averaging 17.2 points per contest has 12 or more points in all but one game this season and will need to keep up his tenacious play against the Big Ten’s physical bigs to keep Michigan competitive in conference play. Record: 8-4 (1-1 B1G) Next Game: vs. Coppin State Maryland’s start to the campaign has been brutal. Seen as a potential top-three Big Ten powerhouse to enter the season the Terrapins’ struggles to win away from the Xfinity Center has led to losses to Villanova Indiana Davidson and UAB. Good news for Maryland is it may have turned a corner with a huge road win at UCLA — yes the Terrapins can win on the road. Throw in one of the Big Ten’s best scorers in Jahmir Young averaging 19.3 points per game and the dynamic lefty’s ability to ignite the Terrapins’ offense is critical to Maryland’s conference outlook. What it really comes down to is Julian Reese’s ability to contribute. When on the court and playing well Reese’s impact offensively and defensively with 14.0 points 9.7 rebounds and 2.2 blocks per game is superfood for Maryland. But the Terrapins’ big man has struggled through foul trouble in big moments so far. What version of Reese that shows up any given contest is the biggest x-factor for a squad that needs to help Young carry the load. Record: 9-3 (1-1 B1G) Next Game: vs. Maine At the beginning of the season Minnesota would have been the clear favorite for the last spot on this list but now sit at nine wins — the same number they finished all of last season with. The Golden Gophers have feasted on an easy non-conference schedule and managed to capitalize on Nebraska’s second half collapse for their first conference win at The Barn. Minnesota has some pieces too with Dawson Garcia continuing to show he’s one of the conference’s better scorers averaging 18.2 points per game Elijah Hawkins developing as a facilitating engine (currently tied for second in all of college basketball with 7.6 assists per game) and Joshua Ola-Joseph as an athletic forward who is a willing rebounder and double-digit scorer. With a four-game win streak if Minnesota continues to mesh the Golden Gophers should easily finish with more than the two wins in conference play they had just a year ago. Record: 6-6 (1-1 B1G) Next Game: vs. Rider After losing Head Coach Micah Shrewsberry and stars like Jalen Pickett and Seth Lundy this Nittany Lions’ squad is completely different from last year’s. However with Kanye Clary’s 17.3 points per game and Ace Baldwin’s 13.9 points and 4.1 assists per contest helping leading the way Penn State has played competitive basketball. It lost to Maryland in overtime on the road but mounted a big-time comeback over Ohio State at home. If Clary and Baldwin keep balling out and Georgetown-transfer Qudus Wahab continues averaging nearly a double-double per contest with his 10.1 points and 9.0 rebounds per game expect Penn State to be a dark horse team in the Big Ten standings. For now inconsistency has the Nittany Lions just above the bottom of these power rankings. Record: 7-4 (0-1 B1G) Next Game: vs. Stonehill Beating Seton Hall in the Garden State Hardwood Classic was a quality win for the Scarlet Knights but other than an 11-point win over Georgetown Rutgers has been uninspiring in non-conference play. Cliff Omoruyi is still one of the conference’s best big men but even his numbers are down in a post- Cam Spencer Caleb McConnell and Paul Mulcahy world. Getting Mawot Mag back is a huge lift but with Aundre Hyatt’s 12.1 points per game leading Rutgers in scoring the Scarlet Knights will struggle to score in conference play. Rutgers does boast the Big Ten’s best scoring defense but its lack of natural scorers is incredibly concerning with January approaching. Record: 7-5 (0-2 B1G) Next Game: vs. NIU If Iowa ends the year here it would certainly be a shock. Nonetheless the Hawkeyes have trudged through non-conference play beating the teams it should but losing games to ranked Creighton Oklahoma and Purdue squads. A loss at home against Michigan and a blow-out defeat on the road to rival Iowa State are also forgettable. The Hawkeyes have scorers with Ben Krikke Payton Sandfort Tony Perkins and Patrick McCaffrey scoring in double digits but are allergic to playing defense — currently ranked second-to-last in the Big Ten in scoring defense. One of only two teams that are 0-2 in conference play until the Hawkeyes show they can beat a legitimate opponent they’ll be stuck at or near the bottom of this list.           \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story With Week 16 of the NFL season in the books it’s clear that some ‘Cats are making the most of their time in the pros. Let’s dive into how NU alums are performing on their respective squads. Rashawn Slater: Los Angeles Chargers OT Slater had a bounce-back performance in the Chargers’ 24-22 loss to the Bills. In 70 offensive snaps played the tackle didn’t give up a single pressure. Better yet his PFF grade of 76.9 was second-best among Los Angeles’ offensive players.  It’s been tough sledding for the Chargers who are just one of three AFC teams with double-digit losses. Nonetheless Slater has battled through nagging injuries to protect both Justin Herbert and Easton Stick in the pocket. He’ll look to neutralize Denver’s pass rush in a divisional showdown on Sunday afternoon. Week 17 matchup: at Denver Broncos (Sunday 3:25 p.m. CT) Greg Newsome II: Cleveland Browns CB Newsome played a quiet game on the stat sheet during the Browns’ 36-22 win over the Texans. He recorded two tackles (one solo) and a pass deflection while playing just 73% of Cleveland’s defensive snaps. Listed at 192 pounds the third-year corner has had some issues bringing down ball-carriers. With 30 seconds to go in the first half Newsome opted to ram into tight end Dalton Schultz rather than wrapping up allowing the pass catcher to slip by for a first down.  Luckily his teammates bailed him out one play later after Case Keenum threw his first interception of the day. Newsome has been an electrifying presence for Cleveland’s defense but his less-than-sound tackling could come back to bite him in a crucial postseason moment. He’ll continue his Pro Bowl-caliber season on Thursday night against the floundering Jets. Week 17 matchup: vs. New York Jets (Thursday 7:15 p.m. CT) Peter Skoronski: Tennessee Titans OG Skoronski experienced all the highs and lows of being a rookie lineman during the Titans’ 20-17 loss to the Seahawks. Late in the first quarter he came across the line for a trap block that freed a lane for Derrick Henry. He had some more highlight plays blocking out front on screens throughout the game.  Despite his success in the run game Skoronski had a crucial slip-up in the final frame of action. With just 20 seconds left for Tennessee to drive down the field the rookie let Leonard Williams bully him and collapse the pocket. Before Skoronski could recover Dre’Mont Jones came screaming around the edge to sack Will Levis. That lost yardage was simply too much to overcome as the Titans fell to 5-10.  Week 17 matchup: at Houston Texans (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Trevor Siemian: New York Jets QB Siemian made his first start of the season during the Jets’ 30-28 win over the Commanders. His statline certainly could’ve been worse as he went 27-of-49 with a touchdown and an interception. However the Jets punted in five of their seven second-half possessions almost blowing the 27-7 lead they held entering halftime. The 32-year-old added 18 yards on four scrambles but lost his fifth fumble in three games. He managed to do just enough to secure the win for the Jets even though it wasn’t a particularly convincing victory. Siemian is in line to start his second consecutive game in Week 17 with Zach Wilson still in concussion protocol. Week 17 matchup: at Cleveland Browns (Thursday 7:15 p.m. CT) Cameron Mitchell: Cleveland Browns CB Mitchell played his typical relief role in the Browns’ 36-22 victory in Houston. He made a solo tackle in the fourth quarter bringing down veteran receiver Robert Woods after a two-yard gain. Mitchell played 61% of Cleveland’s defensive snaps as he subbed in for starters when they needed a rest. In 11 games played Mitchell has recorded 13 combined tackles two pass deflections and a sack. The fifth-round rookie has been a pleasant surprise for the Browns who continue to produce effective players in the secondary. Mitchell will continue the hunt for his first NFL interception against Trevor Siemian on Thursday night.  Week 17 matchup: vs. New York Jets (Thursday 7:15 p.m. CT) Adetomiwa Adebawore: Indianapolis Colts DE Adebawore had another quiet output during the Colts’ 29-10 loss to the Falcons. He played just 15 defensive snaps and six more on special teams failing to get on the stat sheet. With the Colts in search of a playoff spot Adebawore’s immediate development hasn’t been the team’s priority. To date Adebawore has notched 1.5 sacks four QB hits and one tackle for loss. His production shouldn’t be discounted considering he’s played just 132 defensive snaps all season. Adebawore will look to make a larger impact at home against the Raiders and Aidan O’Connell a fellow rookie who has been very skittish in the pocket.  Week 17 matchup: vs. Las Vegas Raiders (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Ben Skowronek: Los Angeles Rams WR Skowronek played a particularly quiet game during the Rams’ 30-22 win over the Saints. He had his first day without a catch or tackle on special teams since Week Nine. In fact Skowronek only saw the field for one offensive snap — his fewest all season.  These days the third-year receiver’s best bet at recording statistics is on special teams as a gunner. Even then Skowronek has been rendered all but invisible in the Rams’ offensive scheme. He’ll attempt to make a difference on the road against the Giants. Week 17 matchup: at New York Giants (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Godwin Igwebuike: Pittsburgh Steelers RB Igwebuike had an uneventful day during the Steelers’ 34-11 loss to the Bengals. For the first time since Week 11 he didn’t get the chance to return a kickoff. He still managed to see the field as a gunner playing half of Pittsburgh’s snaps on special teams. The veteran will have to keep producing to hold onto his job as the Steelers’ starting kick returner. He’s done a great job so far averaging 25.1 yards per kickoff return. Igwebuike will look to make Seattle’s defenders miss on Sunday afternoon’s return opportunities.  Week 17 matchup: at Seattle Seahawks (Sunday 3:05 p.m. CT) Blake Hance: Jacksonville Jaguars OL Hance didn’t see much action during the Jaguars’ 30-12 drubbing at the hands of the Buccaneers. He played just one special teams snap and didn’t enter on offense for the fifth time this season.  At 8-7 Jacksonville is now in a three-way tie with the Colts and Texans for the AFC South crown. They do hold tiebreakers over the two teams but Hance and the Jaguars are facing a must-win game against the Panthers to maintain their playoff hopes. Week 17 matchup: vs. Carolina Panthers (Sunday 12 p.m. CT) Earnest Brown IV: Los Angeles Rams DE Brown played just his sixth game of the season during the Rams’ 30-22 victory against New Orleans. He didn’t record any statistics as he saw the field for just five defensive snaps.  The second-year defensive end hasn’t made the impact he would’ve hoped in 2023.

Genyk took over tight-end coaching duties at the conclusion of the 2021 season. In 2023 Genyk’s special teams unit had mixed results. Jack Olsen made 14 of 19 field goals on the year but Northwestern tied for second-to-last in the Big Ten in net punting yardage during the regular season with 37.3 yards per boot. Additionally it earned just 46 yards on nine punt returns through the regular season after totaling 19 yards on eight returns in 2022. Despite Garner Wallace’s fumble return for a score on a kickoff against Illinois Northwestern hasn’t scored a kick or punt return touchdown with Genyk at the helm. The Ann Arbor Michigan native had immense experience coaching at Northwestern before his return in 2018 as he served as an assistant coach at a number of positions from 1994 to 2003. During that decade-long span Genyk oversaw linebackers running backs defensive backs and special teamers. He also worked as a quality control coach and consultant on the 2015 team. Outside of his time in Evanston Genyk held the Eastern Michigan head-coaching job from 2004 until 2008 when he was fired after going 16-42 in five seasons.

Share this story Although Northwestern had a winning record for the first time in three years the Wildcats are still making notable changes. In his first major move as NU’s full-time head coach David Braun has elected to fire offensive coordinator Mike Bajakian Matt Fortuna reported Thursday afternoon. ESPN’s Sean McDonough also announced the move during Saturday’s Las Vegas Bowl. Sources: Northwestern has parted ways with OC Mike Bajakian special teams coordinator/TEs coach Jeff Genyk and director of sports performance for football Jay Hooten. https://t.co/fxngM3l8wk Bajakian served as the Wildcats’ OC from 2020-23. His first year in Evanston was rather fruitful in taking over for Mick McCall posting 24.7 points per game and leading NU to a 7-2 record with a Citrus Bowl win. However things have soured considerably in the last three seasons — particularly from 2021-22 when the ‘Cats scored 15.16 points per game. There was marginal improvement with sixth-year quarterback Ben Bryant under center this season but Northwestern’s 22.1 PPG is still 104th in the FBS. Other problematic areas have been rushing — in which NU ranks 119th at 101.4 yards per game — time of possession in which NU is 101st — and penalties where the ‘Cats have amassed 34 accepted blocking fouls in 11 games. Even when the Wildcats had bright moments inconsistency ensued. NU posted 24 first-half points against Maryland but mustered only three field goals in a lackluster second half. Likewise Northwestern was the first team to score 24 points in the first 30 minutes in Wisconsin’s Camp Randall Stadium since 2008 but then was held scoreless — and well under 50 yards of offense — in the second half. On top of subpar offensive production Bajakian generated strong negative reactions when he donned a “Cats Against The World” shirt in support of former Northwestern football coach Pat Fitzgerald in the first open practice following Fitzgerald’s firing on Aug. 9. Such shirts were reprimanded by NU athletic director Derrick Gragg in a subsequent statement. Bajakian 49 previously spent time as the OC at Boston College Tennessee Cincinnati and Central Michigan.

Share this story Before the season it felt like all the cards were stacked against Northwestern. Now only a few days removed from a Las Vegas Bowl victory over Utah it feels like the ‘Cats have hit the jackpot. But it wasn’t just luck of the draw that landed Northwestern at this point. It was a season of resilience character and heart. Aside from those intangible qualities Northwestern’s season can be told through stats and numbers. So let’s take a journey back through the 2023 campaign using some key figures to shine a spotlight on an unforgettable season for Northwestern fans. Here are 21 numbers that tell the story of the Wildcats’ season (I’ll cool it on the Vegas references I promise). 52: The number of days between David Braun being named interim head coach and the season opener against Rutgers In early July the Northwestern program was turned upside-down. After the sudden firing of longtime coach Pat Fitzgerald due to allegations of hazing within the Northwestern program it felt like the Wildcats were on the brink of collapse. NU named Braun its interim coach with less than two months to prepare for Rutgers. It was a near-impossible situation for one of the youngest head coaches in the FBS. And although the Rutgers game did not go as planned Braun quickly shed his inexperience and looked like a seasoned leader on the sidelines. Speaking of inexperience... 0: The number of games David Braun had coached at the FBS level prior to 2023 Not only had Braun never been a head coach when he was thrust into the position in July but he had never even coached at this level of college football. Braun had spent his previous years as a position coach at FCS-level Northern Iowa and North Dakota State before being promoted to defensive coordinator for the Bison. Originally brought to Evanston to call the defense Braun was working double-duty while still getting to know players on the offense making his result at season’s end that much more impressive. 7th: The consensus prediction for where Northwestern would finish among the Big Ten West Prognosticators did not like Northwestern’s chances coming into to 2023. Coming off a 1-11 season Northwestern lost four players to the NFL and had just replaced its coach weeks before kickoff. It was justifiable to doubt Northwestern’s bounce-back. All eight of CBS’ college football experts picked the ‘Cats to finish dead last in a weak division. And I’m not trying to pick on CBS. Even this site was skeptical with even our most optimistic picker predicting a 4-8 record for the Wildcats. Across the CFB landscape there were murmurs that Northwestern could go 0-12. The ‘Cats finished 8-5 and placed second in the Big Ten West. Doubters be damned. 693: The number of days Northwestern went without a win on American soil In Week Two the UTEP Miners came to Ryan Field with the fanbase still feeling pretty pessimistic about the team after a loss to Rutgers. Oddsmakers shared that skepticism making the ‘Cats only a one-point favorite at home against their C-USA foe. Northwestern demolished UTEP 38-7 to break the winless streak in America and the strong showing was just a sign for more to come. 79: The combined total of points surrendered to No. 21 Duke and No. 6 Penn State Excuse me for going slightly out of order. More on the game sandwiched between these two losses will follow. But it’d be disingenuous to only take the good stats. The Northwestern defense struggled against these two ranked opponents. At times the ‘Cats looked competitive in each of these games even taking Penn State to the halftime locker room with a tied score. But ultimately two talented teams got the better of Northwestern and provided an early-season reality check. 99.5%: Minnesota’s win probability against Northwestern at its highest point (per Yahoo Sports) This one is going to be a bundle of stats. Northwestern’s 37-34 overtime comeback win against the Golden Gophers was one of the wildest finishes in all of college football this season. Many fans had left when Northwestern trailed 24-7 at halftime. The crowd thinned out even more when Minnesota took a 31-10 lead into the fourth quarter. Here are an extra duo of bonkers stats that I’d be remiss to not include: 4: The number of games Brendan Sullivan started in Ben Bryant’s place After Bryant went down with an injury in the Penn State loss backup Sullivan had to keep the ship afloat and man the offense. In those four games Sullivan kept the team in bowl contention by going 2-2. Sully was especially effective in the Maryland match throwing for 265 yards and two touchdowns and adding another 56 yards on the ground. 31.5: The record-setting over/under for Northwestern-Iowa When the line opened for Northwestern and Iowa’s match at Wrigley Field the painstakingly low 31.5 scoring total line marked a record as the lowest in college football history. Hilariously the under hit as Iowa won 10-7. The record was broken a week later when the Iowa-Rutgers line was put at a mere 27.5. That mark didn’t hold the title belt for long either being topped two weeks later by a comical 25.5 total for Iowa-Nebraska. All three unders hit in classic Kirk Ferentz fashion. 1092: The length of Northwestern’s streak of days without a road victory before playing Wisconsin Sitting at 4-5 Northwestern traveled to Madison to try to bring its record back to .500 against a tough opponent in the Badgers. Early on the ‘Cats came out feisty converting each of their first 10 third downs and taking a 24-3 lead to the half. NU held on in the second half to win 24-10 quashing an unbelievably long dry spell without a true road victory. It was the Wildcats who were jumping around in Madison that Saturday afternoon. 1: The longest Northwestern losing streak of the 2023 season In his first year David Braun often talked about the resilience of this Wildcat squad. No stat better encapsulates this resilience than this one. Not once did the ‘Cats let losses snowball. For a while it looked like one might also be the longest win streak of the season as the win column in the ‘Cats’ first 10 games looked like L-W-L-W-L-W-L-W-L-W — but the Iowa loss at Wrigley Field proved to be the final taste of defeat of the season. 3: The number of times Northwestern has stormed the field/court after beating a Purdue team in the 2023 calendar year Okay you caught me. This isn’t a football-only statistic but it does help me make my larger point. Setting aside two unforgettable parties on the court at Welsh-Ryan Arena after wins against No. 1 Purdue in men’s basketball let’s zoom in on football game number 11 against Purdue. This 23-15 win which happened in an unnecessarily stressful fashion not only marked the ‘Cats’ first win streak of the season but it also clinched Northwestern’s ticket to a bowl game with a sixth victory on senior day. And perhaps most importantly it provided a storybook ending for the current iteration of Ryan Field due for a massive renovation in the upcoming years. 5-1: Northwestern’s record at Ryan Field Florida at The Swamp. USC at LA Memorial Coliseum. Wisconsin at Camp Randall. Auburn at Jordan-Hare Stadium. All of these places with supposed massive home-field advantages witnessed more losses than Northwestern fans did at Ryan Field. With the exception of a top-10 Penn State team the ‘Cats defended their home turf all season including twice when they were an underdog. Despite its limited capacity the oddly charming Ryan Field became one of the most unlikely home-field advantages in its final season. 1000000: Everyone’s estimated heart rate watching the end of Northwestern-Illinois 45-43? That’s not Big Ten West football. Sir you must be lost. This is not the Big 12. When these two rivals collided for the Land of Lincoln Trophy on the final weekend of the regular season nobody expected a barn-burner that would see 37 combined fourth quarter points and a record for the highest-scoring game in the 117-year history of the rivalry. But that’s what we got in an instant-classic that featured five lead changes and a controversial ending on an Illinois two-point attempt that would have tied the game (it was the right no-call). Not only did Northwestern shut Illinois out of bowl season but the ‘Cats brought the HAT back to Evanston. +13: Northwestern’s end-of-season turnover margin A year after finishing -18 in the same category Northwestern swung 31 turnovers in the positive direction a major reason for this season’s success. With a handful of bowl results still pending Northwestern sits third among all FBS teams thanks to both an opportunistic defense and an offense that prioritized ball security. The ‘Cats were one of two teams in the nation (Ole Miss) to lose just one fumble and in the four-game win streak to close the season Northwestern’s defense forced a whopping 12 turnovers. 5: The length of Cam Johnson’s end-of-season touchdown streak The senior transfer from Vanderbilt and Arizona State was a revelation for the ‘Cats all season long. Johnson won the team’s triple-crown leading the Wildcats in receptions receiving yards and touchdowns. In his final five games Johnson snagged a touchdown in each and posted a dominant line of seven catches for 124 yards and a score to propel the ‘Cats over Illinois. In just one season in Evanston the sure-handed receiver left his mark and provided a juice to the offense that had been absent for the past few seasons. 110: The number of tackles that both Bryce Gallagher and Xander Mueller eclipsed Gallagher (120 tackles) and Mueller (110) became the first pair of Wildcats in a season to each record triple-digit tackles since Paddy Fisher and Blake Gallagher in 2018. The duo of senior linebackers anchored a defense that truly hit its stride in the back half of the season holding five of its final seven opponents to 17 points or fewer. Gallagher added a sack a pick and two forced fumbles across the season while Mueller stuffed the stat sheet with three interceptions five sacks and a forced fumble. 10: The number of yards for Ben Bryant scrambled to clinch the Las Vegas Bowl for Northwestern Bryant should never have to buy a drink in Evanston again after what he did in Vegas. After taking a truly nasty hit that briefly removed him from the game Bryant stunningly returned to the fourth quarter of the Vegas Bowl where he subsequently dropped two seeds to A.J. Henning and Kirtz leading what was ultimately the game-winning touchdown drive. On the next possession on third-and-7 with Utah on the verge of getting the ball back Bryant put his body on the line once again diving for enough yardage to close out his college career with a victory. The transfer gunslinger provided stable quarterback play for the ‘Cats all season long adding veteran leadership and a level of operation at the position the Wildcats have not seen since 2020. 5: Northwestern’s active win streak in bowl games Following the win in Vegas Northwestern has amassed hardware from a bowl game five times since 2016 capturing wins in the Pinstripe Bowl Music City Bowl Holiday Bowl Citrus Bowl and of course the Las Vegas Bowl. For a program that lost all nine bowls it appeared in between 1996 and 2011 winning five in a row and six of seven is an impressive feat. The current streak is tied for third-longest in the NCAA. +7: Northwestern’s win improvement from 2022 to 2023 1-11 to 8-5. Simply unbelievable. The seven-win difference is the largest by any FBS team this season. Only a handful of teams this century have seen a turnaround this fast and it’s easy to make the argument that none faced the obstacles that this Northwestern team did. It’s why Braun was the easy choice for Big Ten Coach of the Year as his eight wins are the most by a Wildcat first-year coach since 1903; Braun became the fifth Northwestern coach to win the award. Under Braun’s leadership the offense improved its points per game by 8.33 while the defense allowed 5.79 fewer points per match. Braun’s incredible achievements and the team’s radical improvement were the only fitting way to end this piece.  With that it’s time to end the number crunching and tie a bow on an unforgettable Northwestern football season. If I’ve learned anything about Coach Braun this season the only number he cares about is 1-0 — making sure the ‘Cats come out with a win when Miami (Ohio) comes to town to kick off the 2024 season.        \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story As Northwestern’s improbable season has officially come to a close Inside NU will spend the next few weeks wrapping up our coverage of the 2023 football season. Yesterday we started our review of each position group with the quarterbacks. Today we move onto the running backs. Overall Grade: B I know this is the same grade the position received last year even though the ‘Cats collectively rushed for fewer yards this season. I wasn’t particularly impressed or disappointed by the running backs who didn’t necessarily shine on a team with better options elsewhere on offense. However the fact that this was a collective effort rather than a one man show – and that there were vast improvements by multiple players who struggled last year – keeps the B rating intact. Evan Hull was the only trustworthy source of offense for the ‘Cats last season a predicament that seemed to evaporate with an improved group of skill players. The additions of Ben Bryant AJ Henning and Cam Johnson through the transfer portal lessened the burden on the running attack as Northwestern’s offense was better able to move the ball down the field without constantly relying on the run.  Northwestern’s group of running backs fall into a category in which the whole is less than the sum of its parts. The individual players each met or surpassed initial expectations but their collective numbers pale in comparison to fellow Big Ten teams. NU finished 13 out of 14 in the conference in rushing yards per game and near the back of the pack in most other measurements as well. That calculation could be inaccurate due to the inclusion of non-running backs such as Brendan Sullivan A.J. Henning and Jack Lausch but the trio of Cam Porter Tre Tyus and Joseph Himon II would likely fall near the bottom regardless. Porter was the bell cow of the group receiving the vast majority of carries. In the Mike Bajakian-led offense Porter carried the load on first and second down attempting to set up for potential passing conversions on third down. As many know that gameplan was not an overwhelming success and made the offense predictable and unpalatable at times. The clock is ticking on Bajakian’s inevitable departure a move that should hopefully lead to greater diversity in offensive creativity and play-calling in the future.  Tyus and Himon each played a distinct role in the offensive operation as well. Tyus served as an efficient secondary back to Porter while Himon’s speed and agility contributed to his success in the passing attack. Both should have enhanced responsibilities next season and improve upon the strides they made this year after falling short of expectations in 2022. Player Grades Cam Porter: B Stats: 166 carries 651 rushing yards four rushing touchdowns 121 receiving yards one receiving touchdown After acting as Hull’s backup last season Porter finally regained the starting position he held prior to tearing his ACL in 2021. Porter certainly didn’t mirror Hull’s success but still proved the most productive and capable halfback on the roster. He improved his numbers from last year averaging 3.9 yards per carry and 50 per game — up from 3.3 and 26 respectively. The latter surely rose due to increased play time but the former is a notable boost independent of Porter’s increased snap count. Porter started slowly rushing for only eight yards on the ground against Rutgers with a few receptions to his name as well. He quickly gained steam however putting up one of his more impactful performances of the season with 104 yards from scrimmage against UTEP. After a string of reasonably average performances against Duke and Minnesota Porter’s production became very inconsistent with a mix of good bad and mediocre games to round out his likely final season in Evanston. One of Porter’s most prominent games of the season came in Northwestern’s bowl-clinching victory over Purdue in which he matched his yards total from the UTEP game. He made contributions early on punching in a seven-yard touchdown run early in the first quarter setting the tone for the rest of the afternoon. In the fourth quarter Porter made his biggest play of the season rushing for a 34-yard score to secure his second touchdown and put the game out of reach for the Boilermakers.  Porter will undoubtedly be missed on this Northwestern team. He was a consistent presence on the field and held onto the ball having never committed a turnover this season. Yet he also lacked the explosiveness and vigor possessed by others on the roster keeping him from being a game-changer and making many impact plays. He receives a B for simply meeting expectations unlike his two teammates I’ll discuss momentarily. Anthony Tyus III: B+ Stats: 50 carries 238 rushing yards one rushing touchdown 16 receiving yards Tyus had a sophomore slump in 2022 receiving the lowest grade of a C for Inside NU’s ratings last season. This year he experienced somewhat of a junior jump while backing up Cam Porter. The most sizable improvement came from Tyus’ massive increase in average yards per carry rising significantly from 2.9 to 4.8 the highest on the team. He didn’t record a carry until the late September blowout loss to Penn State but his impact only grew from there. Against Howard Tyus rushed for 44 yards and followed that up with a 63-yard showing two weeks later against Nebraska. He also played a significant role in the regular-season finale against Illinois rushing for 45 yards and a score to help Northwestern reclaim the HAT for the first time in three years. While Tyus thrived on the ground he had minimal impact in the passing game. He recorded a total of 16 receiving yards on the season a number among the lowest of anyone on the team. This was actually a decrease from his already low 49 yards from last year a further indication of Tyus’s complete inaction in the aerial attack. That’s something Tyus will certainly look to improve as he prepares to potentially take on the starting role in 2024. Joseph Himon II: B+ Stats: 35 carries 136 rushing yards 219 receiving yards one receiving touchdown If there’s one word that adequately describes Himon it’s explosive. His sophomore season was a vast improvement after having minimal impact as a first-year. Himon doesn’t mainly receive his B+ for averaging 3.9 yards per carry though. It primarily comes from his elusiveness and ability to get into open space which could be seen frequently. An 85-yard touchdown reception off a screen against UTEP proved crucial in Northwestern’s first win of the season and a similar 53-yarder against Maryland provided a massive spark in what became one of the more noteworthy victories of the year. Himon also impressed against Big Ten West opponents Wisconsin and Minnesota but his production was sporadic beyond his four impactful games. He was almost nonexistent in many of NU’s other contests which must be improved with his role set to expand in his junior season with the ‘Cats.  Jake Arthurs: Incomplete Stats: four carries 11 rushing yards There isn’t much to say about the senior hailing from nearby Wheaton Illinois. After not seeing the field in 2022 Arthurs got minimal action this season registering only 11 yards on the ground in two games against UTEP and Penn State. Caleb Komolafe: Incomplete Stats: four carries nine rushing yards 33 receiving yards one receiving touchdown It was a quiet season for the first-year from Texas. The highlight for Komolafe was a receiving touchdown he caught in the dying moments of the season opener against Rutgers giving the ‘Cats their first and only points of that game. However the future does look bright for the young running back. Expect increased production in 2024 with Cam Porter presumably out of the picture. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Northwestern women’s basketball (5-7 0-1 B1G) plays its Big Ten home opener this Saturday against fellow early-season strugglers Rutgers. The momentary Christmas break has given teams time to reflect on their concluded non-conference schedule and prepare for the long winter marathon of Big Ten play. It has also provided the wider basketball community with an opportunity to take fresh stock of each program’s progress with 2024 just around the corner. While the season is still in its nascent stages enough data has amassed for us to take a speculative look at where things stand before conference play heats up. 1. No. 4 Iowa (12-1 1-0 B1G) A shocking home loss to Kansas State in mid-November briefly set alarm bells off in Iowa City but Caitlin Clark and Co. have rebounded to win nine straight including avenging their defeat to the Big 12 Wildcats just 10 days later. Clark has continued the fine form that saw her propel the Hawkeyes to within a game of the national championship last spring leading the team in points (30.5) rebounds (7.5) and assists (7.4). The senior guard’s already impeccable three-point shooting has become even more prolific this season — she has averaged 4.6 made threes per game on 39.2% from beyond the arc. With Clark the consensus No. 1 pick in next year’s WNBA Draft humbling opponents week in week out it is no wonder that the Hawkeyes are overwhelming favorites for the Big Ten title. 2. No. 17 Ohio State (10-2 1-0 B1G) The Buckeyes have fallen 10 spots from their preseason ranking of No. 7 in the AP Top 25 largely due to an opening day loss to No. 21 USC. Since then Ohio State has mostly righted the ship winning nine on the trot (including two victories over teams ranked at the time) before competing well in a six-point loss to No. 2 UCLA. While they lost last season’s top scorer Taylor Mikesell much of the core that led the Buckeyes to a stunning 19-0 start and an Elite Eight appearance remains in Columbus. OSU has benefited from the consistent performances of senior and WNBA prospect Jacy Sheldon who spent much of last season sidelined due to a leg injury but has so far averaged 19.1 points per game on 56.0% from the field. Cotie McMahon and Taylor Thierry have also chipped in with double figures for a team which despite an early hiccup has shown immense quality. 3. No. 16 Indiana (10-1 1-0 B1G) While AP poll voters ranked Indiana above Ohio State for the first time this season in Week Eight the Hoosiers remain just below in these rankings for the moment largely owing to their relative strength of schedule. IU’s sole loss was a 96-64 drubbing at the hands of No. 15 Stanford in its second game of the season but the team has since been perfect albeit against mostly vastly inferior opponents. Under the reign of head coach Teri Moren Indiana has become something of a juggernaut in the past four seasons after decades of mediocrity. However the Hoosiers are looking to recover from last year’s postseason disappointment — after claiming the regular season Big Ten title with a 16-2 conference record they lost in the Big Ten Tournament semifinals to Ohio State before crashing out of March Madness in the second round as a No. 1 seed. The Hoosiers’ revenge tour has thus far been led by seniors Mackenzie Holmes and Sara Scalia whose post presence and three-point shooting respectively should yield another fruitful season. 4. Penn State (9-3 0-1 B1G) Penn State has been among the biggest surprise packages of non-conference play so far and competed well in its Big Ten opener: a 10-point loss at rivals Ohio State. The Nittany Lions were also minutes away from a seismic upset over No. 8 USC ultimately falling short by just a single point to the team that beat Ohio State by nine. Few fancied the Lions to compete at the top end of the Big Ten after Carolyn Kieger’s side amassed only four conference wins last season good enough for a 12th-place finish. Nevertheless if star duo Makenna Marisa and Shay Ciezki can keep up their hot start there is no reason Penn State shouldn’t be able to disrupt the traditional Big Ten order. 5. Maryland (9-3 1-0 B1G) Non-conference play did not go to plan for this superpower program which sought to challenge itself with a difficult early schedule following a 15-3 Big Ten record and an Elite Eight appearance last season. Maryland played three ranked teams in its first five games and lost all of them by at least 20 points including a 114-76 shellacking at the hands of No. 6 South Carolina. Even the Terps’ 13-point win over a struggling Northwestern was largely unconvincing. After starting the season ranked 14th the Terrapins have now dropped out of the AP Top 25 altogether. If legendary head coach Brenda Frese’s tenure is anything to go by however it won’t be long before Maryland starts playing elite level basketball. Since joining the Big Ten in 2014 the Terps have won six out of nine possible regular season conference titles; stretching back further they have made 13 straight NCAA Tournament appearances. Despite the early struggles it would be silly to count Maryland out until more significant evidence of its demise emerges. 6. Minnesota (11-1 1-0 B1G) Picked dead last in Inside NU’s pre-season power rankings Minnesota has started the season surprisingly well with just one entry in the loss column heading into Big Ten play. Sterner tests undoubtedly await the Golden Gophers but the early signs point to a turnaround not dissimilar to Penn State’s having also finished last season with just four conference wins. New head coach Dawn Plitzuweit has made an early impression after a one-season stint with West Virginia where she led the Mountaineers to an NCAA Tournament appearance. Sophomore sharpshooter Mara Braun is a standout averaging 20.3 points per game. Minnesota’s non-conference schedule was admittedly littered with mediocre opponents but a gritty 60-58 win over Purdue to open Big Ten play justifies its position in these power rankings. 7. Nebraska (9-3 1-0 B1G) A road loss to Kansas has somewhat soured what was a largely promising non-conference slate for the Cornhuskers who opened their Big Ten schedule with an impressive 80-74 win at Michigan State a week prior. Their other two losses were competitive showings against TCU and Creighton two teams who currently sit in the AP Top 25 after strong starts to the season. Junior center Alexis Markowski has made a big leap from last year and leads the team in scoring (17.3) complementing senior guard Jazz Shelley’s consistent production. Nebraska will be hoping to improve upon an eighth-place 8-10 Big Ten season and appears to have laid the foundations for doing just that.  8. Michigan State (10-2 0-1 B1G) The aforementioned home loss to Nebraska is the only thing keeping Michigan State in the bottom half of these rankings. Otherwise MSU has had a solid yet unspectacular start to the season taking care of business against several undermatched teams and losing to Creighton by 14 points. The Spartans have shared the wealth in terms of scoring thus far with four players averaging double-digit points. Leading the pack is fifth-year senior Moira Joiner whose 16.8 points per game represents a marked improvement on her previous four campaigns. DeeDee Hagemann and Julia Ayrault have also contributed heavily averaging 14.3 and 14.1 points per game respectively. We’ll know a lot more about this team’s true colors after a daunting run of games sees it face Penn State Iowa Maryland and Ohio State to ring in the new year. 9. Michigan (10-3 1-0 B1G) An inconsistent non-conference slate was punctuated by an embarrassing 23-point defeat at Toledo but the Wolverines showed major signs of improvement as they began Big Ten play with a comprehensive 84-48 rout of Illinois. Whether the real Michigan is the team that showed up in Urbana-Champaign or the one that lost by 17 at home to Florida a week later remains to be seen. Fans in Ann Arbor will be hoping the team can build upon five consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances but doing so will require an improvement from Michigan’s star players. Junior Laila Phelia leads the team in points per game but her shooting splits so far (35.6/30.5/81.6) have noticeably declined from last season. UM’s only other returning starter senior Cameron Williams is more of a presence on the boards than a scorer meaning newer players will have to step up and contribute if the Wolverines want to compete at the top of the Big Ten. 10. Wisconsin (7-4 0-1 B1G) The Badgers have shown some positive signs in their search for a first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2010. Their four losses have come against formidable opposition and they even hung with Iowa for nearly an entire half in their first Big Ten game of the season before eventually falling 87-65. While significant strides still must be made before Wisconsin returns to the promised land what is most promising for Marisa Moseley is the performances of her younger players. Sophomore forward Serah Williams is a force to be reckoned with leading the team in both points (16.1) and rebounds (9.0) while freshman D’Yanis Jimenez is second in scoring with 11.5 points per game. 11. Purdue (7-5 0-1 B1G) Purdue’s 7-5 record may be misleading as it played a more challenging non-conference slate than many of its peer institutions but the Boilermakers didn’t exactly cover themselves in glory in blowout losses to No 4. UCLA (92-49) and No. 14 Notre Dame (76-39). Head coach Katie Geralds led Purdue to a national championship as a player and has started to turn this sleeping giant of a program around in her two seasons at the helm but the Boilermakers look to be in danger of taking a step back from their First Four appearance last year. Like with Wisconsin the best news for Geralds is the strength of her newer recruits. While senior guard Abbey Ellis has led the way so far with 14.9 points per game freshmen Rashunda Jones and Mary Ashley Stevenson have both hit the ground running receiving substantial minutes and contributing 10.9 and 9.1 points per game respectively.  12. Illinois (6-5 0-1 B1G) After five years of wallowing in and around the Big Ten basement under Nancy Fahey first-year head coach Shauna Green worked a miracle by delivering 11 conference wins last season four more than Illinois had achieved in Fahey’s five seasons combined. Coming off a First Four appearance the Fighting Illini were much hyped this offseason and began the year ranked 23rd in the AP Poll. Yet it appears Green’s magic might have worn off in the early stages of the season as Illinois has struggled to recapture its winning formula. The Illini’s 36-point loss to Michigan was followed up by consecutive home defeats to mid-tier SEC teams in Missouri and Arkansas. Genesis Bryant’s play has remained rock solid but last year’s top scorer Makira Cook has started the season in cold shooting form — one of many things that must improve for Illinois to replicate last season’s Big Ten performance.  13. Rutgers (6-8 0-1 B1G) This is not a particularly good basketball team. Although the Scarlet Knights acquitted themselves reasonably well in their first Big Ten clash against No. 16 Indiana losing 66-56 their resume also includes a 24-point loss to Fairfield and a 19-point loss to Seton Hall. Former Penn State head coach Coquese Washington guided Rutgers to a 5-13 Big Ten record in her debut season last year but has plenty of work to do if she hopes to return a winning culture to a program that experienced immense success in the early 2000s. Kaylene Smikle carried last season’s team as a freshman and continues to do so this year averaging 17.1 points per game. A more dynamic supporting cast must emerge for Rutgers to get over its non-conference struggles.  14. Northwestern (5-7 0-1 B1G) As painful as it is to rank Northwestern last there is no getting around the six-game losing streak the ‘Cats experienced which included a 90-65 defeat to DePaul and a first loss to Loyola Chicago in program history. Add that to a 58-point thrashing at the hands of No. 16 Notre Dame and there is really no case for Northwestern to be anywhere but the bottom of these rankings. That said Joe McKeown’s team has shown signs of life in its last two games including an impressive second-half comeback to beat Temple on the road. Junior Melannie Daley has been a shining light for the ‘Cats leading the team with 13 points per game after an injury-ridden sophomore year. First-year Casey Harter’s recent emergence as a key player has also given fans reason to believe in a brighter future. This Saturday’s clash with Rutgers is huge. Win and the ‘Cats might not be cellar-dwellers for much longer.    \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Let the frenzy begin.  With the 2023 season officially over all the attention turns to the offseason more specifically the transfer portal. Throughout the offseason Inside NU will keep you updated on all things regarding the portal. This story will continue to be updated throughout the winter and spring. Outgoing Transfers LG Josh Priebe — Committed to Michigan Priebe was the first starter to enter his name in the transfer portal announcing his departure from Evanston before the Las Vegas Bowl. Priebe played in all 12 regular season games in 2023 after missing time in 2022 with a torn ACL and he earned Third Team All-Big Ten honors. In a statement posted to Twitter Priebe cited uncertainty regarding OL coach Kurt Anderson’s job security as a reason for leaving Northwestern. On Dec. 28 Priebe — a native Michigan resident — announced his commitment to U of M. DB Rod Heard II — Committed to Notre Dame Heard became Northwestern’s second major transfer exit announcing the move on Dec. 28. The grad transfer was a linchpin of the Wildcats’ defense for several years as a nickel/slot cornerback earning a team-best 82.3 Pro Football Focus grade and accumulating four TFLs an interception a sack four pass deflections two forced fumbles a fumble recovery and 85 tackles this year. Per source Heard has already garnered interest from incredibly high-level programs including Michigan Ohio State and Notre Dame. Heard announced on Twitter on Jan. 10 that he will head to South Bend. RB Anthony Tyus III — Committed to Ohio Per Rivals Tyus entered the portal on Dec. 30. The junior rushed for 238 yards and a touchdown on 50 carries in 2023. He shared that he will suit up for Ohio next fall on Jan. 26. DT Matt Lawson Lawson played only 16 snaps in NU’s opener at Rutgers after suffering a season-ending knee injury. Otherwise he would’ve figured to be a starter on the inside of Christian Smith’s revamped defensive line. Now he’ll hit the portal for a second straight offseason. OL Alexander Doost — Committed to Arizona The first-year offensive lineman announced on Dec. 27 via Twitter that he would be entering the portal. The Arizona native announced his commitment to the western Wildcats on Dec. 30. DB Nigel Williams Williams entered the portal at the end of November. With two years of eligibility the Virginia native will look for a new home after playing four games in 2023.  QB Cole Freeman Freeman entered the portal on Dec. 4 per On3. He’ll look for a chance at more playing time after providing depth at the back of the quarterback room during his three seasons in Evanston. The junior QB started the final two games of the 2022 season against Purdue and Illinois. OL Zachary Franks Per Rivals Franks entered the transfer portal on Jan. 16. After playing 24 games in five seasons for the ‘Cats the grad transfer will look to finish off his career elsewhere. He opened the 2023 season as Northwestern’s starting right tackle before Josh Thompson took the role during the second half of NU’s blowout win over UTEP.  Players Staying ILB Xander Mueller So far Mueller is the only Wildcat to announce his intentions to stay for his fifth season which he did Thursday afternoon on Instagram. Mueller was the centerpiece of Northwestern’s upstart defense this past season earning Third Team All-Big Ten plaudits by posting three interceptions 10.5 tackles for loss five sacks 110 tackles and a forced fumble. His NFL stock was already on the upswing but Mueller will look to (if it’s even possible) have an even better 2024 in purple and white. WR A.J. Henning After Henning responded to and liked tweets to indicate that he’ll be back in 2024 he announced on Twitter that he would return to Evanston in 2024 on Dec. 29. Without Cam Johnson and possibly Kirtz he’ll have the chance to have a more feature role as potentially the ‘Cats’ top pass-catcher next year. EDGE Richie Hagarty Hagarty posted on Twitter that he’ll be suiting up as a Wildcat for one final year in 2024. The Southern Illinois native posted 14 pressures 2.5 sacks four tackles for loss and a fumble recovery in 2023. Turning Pro ILB Bryce Gallagher  Gallagher announced on Jan. 3 that he would forgo his final year of eligibility and enter his name in the NFL Draft. The ‘Cats’ two-year captain had 120 tackles an interception and two forced fumbles — earning a spot Second-Team All-Big Ten team. RG Dom D’Antonio D’Antonio is turning pro — but as a coach in Italy that is. It was announced on Jan. 22 that D’Antonio will become the offensive line coach of the Lazio Marines who are in the Italian Football League’s First Division and are based in Rome. To Be Determined WR Bryce Kirtz Despite being a fifth-year in 2023 Kirtz possesses an extra year of eligibility awarded to players on rosters of teams playing during the COVID-19 pandemic (both redshirted in 2019). However he could decide to turn pro after a relatively solid season and career. S Coco Azema Azema redshirted his first season in 2019 and spent five total seasons in Evanston. He has one more year left due to COVID. CB Garnett Hollis Jr. Hollis capped a standout 2023 with a marquee showing in the Las Vegas Bowl racking up a critical pass deflection and three stops. He would definitely attract interest at the next level if he elects to declare for the draft but he also could remain with Northwestern for 2024. EDGE Jaylen Pate Pate has a year of eligibility left on the docket according to his Twitter page. In becoming the Wildcats’ top regular EDGE player last year Pate posted a team-best 21 pressures not to mention three sacks three TFLs and a forced fumble. It would certainly provide a critical add to a deeper group if he joins Hagarty in coming back. RB Cam Porter Porter has two years left of eligibility due to COVID and a medical redshirt when he tore his ACL in fall camp in 2021. In 2023 Porter served as the bell cow for the Wildcats racking up 651 rushing yards and four touchdowns adding 121 and a score in the passing game. No. 4 started to find his groove in the back half of the season having strong performances against Wisconsin and Purdue. In 2024 the ‘Cats may take a back-by-committee approach with Joseph Himon II Tre Tyus II and Caleb Komolafe showing flashes in 2023.

Share this story Continuing with our position reviews we move to the outside today looking at one of Northwestern’s most talented wide receiver rooms in recent memory. Note: Receivers that totaled at least two receptions are included here. Overall Grade: A- The transfer portal paid major dividends for Northwestern’s wide receiver room. Even though the ‘Cats lost Malik Washington one of the best receivers in college football this year the team added Cam Johnson from Arizona State and A.J. Henning from Michigan. Johnson Henning and Bryce Kirtz led the receivers.  Johnson and Kirtz both had over 700 yards and Henning contributed 418 yards. The trio combined for 148 receptions. While Northwestern had a strong top three pass-catchers the next leading wide receiver — Raymond Niro III — only had 40 yards. All wide receivers outside of Johnson Kirtz and Henning combined for 10 catches and 92 yards.  Johnson will be out of eligibility next season but Kirtz and Henning have the ability to return. Through using the transfer portal or developing their own receivers the ‘Cats will need to find a few other players that can step up next season. Three receivers that could emerge for the team next season are Frank Covey IV Reggie Fleurima and Calvin Johnson II. As a first-year Covey IV made his debut against Rutgers. However he ended up getting hurt soon after and didn’t garner a large number of snaps after he got healthy. Fleurima hasn’t gotten the opportunity for many snaps on the field but is a former four-star. Throughout the season Johnson II seemed to be the team’s fourth wide receiver but he didn’t collect many targets while in the game.  I decided to give the receiver room an A- because of its overall great play throughout the season. In the middle of the season when Ben Bryant got injured and Brendan Sullivan replaced him the passing numbers dropped; however looking at the full season the receivers had solid outputs. Between Johnson Kirtz and Henning there wasn’t a true number one receiver but they all had their moments. The room isn’t obtaining an A because of the lack of depth and production behind the top three pass-catchers.  Player Grades Cam Johnson: A Johnson the sixth-leading receiver in the Big Ten was the most consistent pass-catcher for the ‘Cats. This season he recorded 54 catches for 715 yards. Johnson ended the year on a tear catching a touchdown in each of his last five games. His best game came against Illinois where he recorded seven catches for 124 yards and a touchdown. Johnson seemed to have a great connection with Ben Bryant and his best games were all with Bryant at quarterback.  This was Johnson’s final year of eligibility having spent four years at Vanderbilt and one year at Arizona State. Before this year Johnson’s best season was in 2020 when he had 56 catches for 545 yards and three touchdowns. He blew away those numbers this year and caught a career-high six touchdowns. Johnson gave the ‘Cats something they lacked in previous years: a receiver who could make tightly contested jump-ball catches.  After coming off a disappointing 10 catches for 84 yards with Arizona State last season the transfer portal addition of Johnson proved to be monumental for Northwestern. Bryce Kirtz: A- Kirtz had his best season at Northwestern in his fifth year. His career has been hampered by injuries as he’s had four knee surgeries in his first four years with the ‘Cats. Before this year Kirtz recorded 44 catches for 482 yards in four seasons combined. This year Kirtz finished as the conference’s seventh-leading pass-catcher with 49 receptions for 701 yards and five touchdowns.  His best game took place in the miraculous comeback against Minnesota. Kirtz had 10 catches for 215 yards and two touchdowns. It’s remarkable because Kirtz’s best season prior to this year was in 2022 when he had 212 yards. Against the Golden Gophers he passed his best yardage for a season in one game. Kirtz was a key reason why Northwestern was able to come back against Minnesota and he was a great deep threat for the team throughout the season. His two longest catches went for 66 and 80 yards. The main reason why Kirtz isn’t receiving an A is because he had a few quiet games during the year. In three separate games Kirtz had three catches for fewer than 20 yards. Kirtz wasn’t as consistent as Johnson but he had some big games against Minnesota and Nebraska. Kirtz has the ability to return next year and if he does it will be a huge boost for Northwestern’s receiving corps.  A.J. Henning: B+ This season Henning recorded the best year of his college career. After spending his first three years at Michigan Henning transferred to Northwestern and made a major impact. He was the 23rd-leading receiver in the conference with 45 catches for 418 yards and four touchdowns. At Michigan Henning was primarily used for his kick and punt returning abilities; however at Northwestern he was more involved in the offense. Henning’s best game of the season came against Wisconsin when he had three catches for 70 yards and a touchdown which included a one-handed grab for 41 yards in the second quarter. He also had four carries for 13 yards in that game. Henning closed out the season strong against Utah with six catches for 57 yards. One of his most notable catches of the year came against Minnesota when he caught a slant route to send the game into overtime in the final seconds.  Henning was utilized in many ways in Northwestern’s offense. He carried the ball on jet sweeps and end around plays. He also caught screen passes and was a fantastic speed element for the offense. No. 3 also gave the ‘Cats a deep ball threat and provided special teams value by returning kicks and punts. Henning has the ability to return next season and will be a key player if he does so. Raymond Niro III: Incomplete Niro III suffered a foot injury during fall camp and was initially thought to be out for the season. However he was able to return and contribute hauling in three receptions for 40 yards. His best game of the season was against Wisconsin when he had two catches for 31 yards. Even though it was a tough start for Niro III’s final season with Northwestern the former walk-on was able to finish out the year strong. Calvin Johnson II: Incomplete Johnson II completed his third year with the ‘Cats by posting four catches for 32 yards. His best game of the season came against Howard catching three passes for 24 yards. Johnson II has the chance to make an impact for Northwestern next season. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Northwestern women’s basketball opened its main Big Ten slate the same way it closed off the calendar year: on a high note. The Wildcats (6-7 1-1 B1G) roared back from a double-digit deficit to pick up their first conference win of the season over Rutgers (6-9 0-2 B1G) in a 77-70 victory. A 19-4 run in the first seven minutes of the fourth quarter fueled NU to a win over a Scarlet Knights team that eliminated the ‘Cats in last season’s Big Ten Tournament. Caileigh Walsh and Melannie Daley both enjoyed great days as the duo combined for 42 points on 14-of-26 shooting from the field. On top of that Paige Mott contributed with 15 points and four rebounds on a hyper-efficient 7-of-9 shooting clip. For Rutgers Lisa Thompson and Kassondra Brown led the way with 17 points apiece. Both players fouled out in the fourth quarter which proved to be critical during Northwestern’s game-clinching run. Star sophomore guard Kaylene Smikle who didn’t play in the first quarter finished with just two points. Even without Smikle in the starting lineup Rutgers drew first blood. Thompson got the scoring started with a midrange jumper and doubled her total with two free throws to put Rutgers up 4-0. However Walsh answered with a catch-and-shoot three. Those buckets were the lone bright spots in a quiet opening stretch as both teams went on to miss their next 10 shots from the field. Walsh added a pair of free throws at the seven-minute mark to give the ‘Cats the lead only for Thompson to break the field goal drought to give the Scarlet Knights a 6-5 edge heading into the game’s first media timeout with 6:27 left in the first quarter. The brief stoppage wouldn’t cool down Thompson who reached eight points on a jumper to answer a layup in transition from Daley. After a few misses Mya Petticord took a rebound down the floor and drained a jump shot to extend Rutgers’ lead to 10-7 marking RU’s first points that Thompson didn’t score.  Mott answered with an and-one on the other end but couldn’t make the free throw. The Scarlet Knights responded by ripping off eight unanswered points. Brown finished an and-one and tacked on the additional free throw with Chyna Cornwell adding to the lead with a layup off a Caroline Lau turnover. After a trey by Petticord NU found itself down 18-9 with 2:32 left in the first period. The ‘Cats briefly rebounded as Walsh poured in four straight points. In response Petticord buried another three-pointer and Thompson got to double digits. Hailey Weaver burnt Rutgers’ press with a fastbreak bucket to cut Northwestern’s deficit but the Wildcats found themselves down 23-15 after 10 minutes. Daley opened the second quarter beautifully intercepting a Thompson pass and feeding Weaver on the break to force a Rutgers timeout just 16 seconds in. Smikle then checked in after not playing the entire first quarter and it appeared to give RU a boost. The Scarlet Knights made three of their next four field goals to extend their lead to double digits again. Not to be outdone Walsh continued to dominate inside with an and-one off a slick pass from Lau. The three-point play got her to 14 points on the afternoon and made it a 31-24 ballgame in Rutgers’ favor. Despite a bucket from Smikle Northwestern continued to click on offense. Mott and Daley found the net with two layups which brought the ‘Cats within five points. Both teams exchanged a few free throws before Mott and Daley poured in two more buckets. No. 21’s teardrop cut Rutgers’ lead to 36-33 with two minutes remaining in the half. A few possessions later though a Walsh layup made it a one-point game. Both teams traded buckets to close out the second quarter with Maggie Pina tying the game at 38 with a three-pointer from the left wing. A jumper by Brown gave Rutgers a 40-38 edge heading into the break but Northwestern had seized momentum with a 19-7 run in the last seven minutes. After a scoreless first half Lau immediately got on the board in the third quarter with a game-tying layup. Cornwell subsequently picked up a point at the charity stripe but Northwestern took the lead for the first time since the 5:53 mark in the first quarter with another layup from Mott. Two free throws from Walsh gave the Wildcats a 44-41 edge —their largest lead of the game. NU’s offensive firepower began to simmer down as it went without a bucket for the next two-plus minutes. Although Destiny Adams picked up a steal-and-score off a bad pass from Casey Harter to give Rutgers the lead back Pina buried her second lead-changing three. Daley then answered a layup by Brown with one of her own which gave Northwestern a 49-48 lead and prompted RU head coach Coquese Washington to use her second timeout with 5:06 in the third quarter. Those 30 seconds energized Rutgers which made its next three shots to go up by four points. Another midrange jumper by Daley and a free throw from Walsh kept NU in the game but a second-chance and-one from Adams sucked the wind out of the Wildcats’ sails. It gave Rutgers a 58-52 lead and punctuated what had been a dominant performance on the boards for RU. It had outrebounded Joe McKeown’s team by a 31-18 margin up to that point. The rest of the period went smoothly for the Scarlet Knights who held a 62-56 lead going into the final 10 minutes. Down but not out the ‘Cats evened up the score with three straight buckets. A block and coast-to-coast layup from Harter was the highlight of what would end up becoming a 12-0 run for Northwestern. Following Harter’s bucket Daley gave the Wildcats the lead back with two free throws. After Harter put in another jumper off a second-chance opportunity Petticord ended Rutgers’ drought with a score to make it 66-64. That didn’t stop Daley who continued to erupt with an and-one jumper that gave Northwestern a five-point edge with under six minutes to go. For the next few minutes the ‘Cats dominated on both ends with Lau punctuating NU’s run with a beautiful feed to Mott. It gave the Wildcats a 75-66 edge with just over three minutes to go. That proved to be the dagger as NU closed out the game without much trouble for its first Big Ten win. Northwestern will continue its Big Ten slate in the new year at Penn State on Tuesday night. Tip-off is set for 5 p.m. CT and the action will be broadcast on Big Ten Plus. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story Moving forward with our position reviews we’ll take a look at how the tight end room fared in 2023. Note: tight ends with at least two receptions are included in this list. Overall Grade: C- No tight end on this roster eclipsed 200 yards receiving and just two were over the 100 yard mark. C- might even be generous for a group with that little yard accumulation. Additionally tight ends accounted for just two Wildcat touchdowns. From a stats perspective the room gets an F. But injuries were certainly a factor that we must take into account. Marshall Lang the leading receiver in the room missed some time midway through the year. Thomas Gordon had some injury struggles too. Both played a lot of games this season but who knows how beaten up they were out there. The tight ends also didn’t benefit from Northwestern’s three-headed-monster of a receiving room. A.J. Henning Cam Johnson and Bryce Kirtz carried the load for the ‘Cats and there simply were not a lot of other targets to go around. It relegated the tight end group into primarily a blocking role at which they were serviceable. Player Grades: Marshall Lang: C Lang a senior from Ohio finished the 2023 campaign with 11 receptions for 116 yards and no touchdowns. Yes that was the most productive tight end stat line that Northwestern can boast from this season. Not great. Lang seemed to have one big catch every game. He had exactly one reception in eight separate contests this season. The only time he eclipsed that mark was in the bowl game when he had three. But he made those receptions count averaging 10.5 yards per catch. As a blocker Lang is decent but there isn’t much else to say. His season was very much just okay. Thomas Gordon: C- Gordon made some big plays for the ‘Cats in 2022 but he didn’t feel as noticeable out there in 2023. He finished the year with 13 receptions for 112 yards and a touchdown early in the season against UTEP. Again just okay. The former three-star recruit out of Houston gets a slightly worse grade than Lang because he hurt Northwestern with penalties on multiple occasions. He had a terrible facemask penalty against Nebraska that stalled a crucial drive. He also had a number of costly holds. Charlie Mangieri: Incomplete The senior from Peoria IL finished the year with seven receptions for 53 yards and a score after missing all of 2022. His one TD was a massive one though against Minnesota in overtime to win. Otherwise there’s not much to say about his season. The six-year Wildcat deserves credit for a solid college career however. Lawson Albright: Incomplete The junior had exactly two receptions for 12 yards. They both came early in the season (one against UTEP and one against Duke) when others were banged up in those games.  \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story The final score of the game doesn’t tell half the story of what the ‘Cats put on last night. Ty Berry and Ryan Langborg combined for half of Northwestern’s total points and the Wildcats never trailed after the midpoint of the first half. This game was a tale of two halves: the first showed the lack of defense seen earlier in the season but the second made it harder to tell if NU’s defense was good or if Jackson State’s offense just couldn’t make a shot. Below are three takeaways from the Wildcats’ last non-conference matchup of 2023-24. Ty Berry’s consistency is key to Northwestern’s offense In the first three games of the season Berry gave the Wildcats a scare averaging only five points per game and shooting not even 40% against their opponents. Although all of those games were wins those first matchups were far closer than they should’ve been. In the first tournament match against Rhode Island Berry scored 13 points eight of which occurred in the first 12 minutes of the game. While this was a glimpse of shooting struggles it wasn’t the whole issue. When the Wildcats get into scoreless lulls they look to Berry to hit a three or an easy jumper to get the team hot again. But early in the season those shots were not falling. Nonetheless the 6-foot-3 guard has scored double-digits in six of the last eight games not to forget scoring zero points against DePaul a few weeks back. It’s nights like that that Berry can’t have with Big Ten play especially when Northwestern plays a stretch of Illinois Ohio State and Purdue in the last week of January. Once Berry finds consistency in his scoring the offense can reach a whole new level. Going into conference play this on-again off-again defense will not survive In the last game against Arizona State Northwestern looked as aggressive as ever pulling boards from every direction. Yet once again it felt like the team playing the Tigers was the same scrambling team that lost to Chicago State. At the opening of the game Jackson State was grabbing all the rebounds offensive and defensive totaling 20 boards by the end of the 1st half. And despite his main job to help out in the post Matthew Nicholson only hauled in a single offensive rebound in his time on the floor along with his four points. As Coach Collins continues to look for the right rhythm for his starting big Blake Preston’s contributions on the floor have proved to help the defense flow. While the stats may not show it teams struggle in their approach when Preston’s at the five in comparison to running circles around Nicholson. But don’t get me wrong: Nicholson was not the primary issue as a collective there seemed to be no sense of reason behind defensive plays. Nicholson had a big block at the start of the second half to keep the Tigers behind. However just six minutes into the game Brooks Barnhizer ran into the paint in an attempt to defend a pick-and-roll leaving Jackson State’s Jayme Mitchell wide-open behind the arc. Easy shots from deep continued throughout the game for JSU simply from the ‘Cats leaving their man open. In the last two games NU has held its opponent to 46 — but by the end of the first the Tigers had 33.  Looking ahead Northwestern is tasked to compete against Illinois whose offense is practically a clinic at every game averaging 81 points per contest. If the ‘Cats don’t find a solid strategy to stop their shooters nor the same aggressiveness as last week they don’t have a chance. However due to the recent suspension of Terrence Shannon Jr. the matchup may be different. Buie needs his supporting cast Boo Buie has absolutely shown his ability to go get shots and create for the guys around him. Thing is it’s not a one-man gig. Buie needs his squad to shine some extra light especially going into the tough conference games. On nights like the last where Langborg and Berry are on fire it allows Buie to take a bit of a breather and focus on being the ultimate shot-creator for the Wildcats. But it’s key that his surrounding core in Barnhizer Berry and Langborg are producing. The attention that Buie commands is the perfect distraction when Langborg’s ready to hit from deep or when Barnhizer slices through defenses.  The problem comes when his cast goes dark. Teams like Nebraska and Rutgers with their top-20 scoring defenses can easily turn the tables. That’s when the ‘Cats need everyone they can get on both sides of the floor from Barnhizer to Nicholson and even Clayton to bring their A-game. It’s not just about Buie; it’s about the whole crew making noise on the court especially up against Northwestern’s next opponents.   \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story 2023 has come to an end. For this site and Northwestern Athletics it was a year that will be remembered for a long time. First of all I want to take a moment to thank each and every one of you for taking time out of your day to read this site. Whether you were here for one article in July or you have read a story every day we are extremely grateful that you spend your time reading what a bunch of college kids have to say. As a site: we wrote nearly 1000 articles covered more than 300 Northwestern Athletic events had 735000 visitors to Inside NU over two million page views and more than 2.3 million minutes of content read. To my knowledge that is the most successful year in site history. Those numbers are a testament to our staff who worked incredibly hard to ensure that all 19 teams got the coverage they deserved. I want to take this moment to thank all of them because this site could not run without them. Over dinner in Las Vegas Bradley Locker Iggy Dowling and I started to reminisce about the year and pure chaos. We decided to try to go through all the days of the year to figure out what the hell has happened in the last 365 days. By the time we had walked to and from The Sphere which I highly recommend we had barely made it to August.  So in this piece we’re going to go through the year that was and put together the highlights the lowlights and everything in between. If you want to point to the start of the ‘Cats’ magical run to the NCAA Tournament look no further than NU’s takedown of the Illini. To be honest this was my first ever Northwestern basketball game so I was unaware of all the pain and suffering from the past. In fact the atmosphere was so crazy that many students got turned away at the door myself included so I bought a ticket from StubHub to get into the game and it was worth it. Inside an electric Welsh-Ryan Chase Audige racked up 21 points with four threes and Boo Buie’s 11-of-12 from the charity stripe lifted NU over the Illini 73-60 its first win against the in-state rival since 2019. The only part I vividly remember from this game was Ty Berry’s three to take the lead and the eruption from the crowd wearing purple. That and Brad Underwood losing his mind on the bench as the Wildcats pulled away which is always an enjoyable sight. For what would come six months later this day became rather important. I can still recall where I was when I got a text from Bradley with a link to ESPN’s Adam Rittenberg’s tweet —the Plex dining hall. With this announcement Maggie Hickey’s investigation launched. You know the rest... On a more positive note January brought David Braun to Evanston. After two abysmal years under Jim O’Neil Pat Fitzgerald brought in the FCS Coordinator of the Year from North Dakota State to run the show. We all know how the year ended for Braun but his defense was spectacular. The ‘Cats finished top five in the nation in the turnover margin and many players exceeded expectations in their first year under Braun. If Northwestern’s trip to the NCAA Tournament did not induce enough drama a COVID pause in 2023 was sure to add some flair. I did not even know that could still happen. This will be the Lakeshow’s first of many references to the list but the only one with a slight negative connotation. In the ‘Cats’ first game of the season they traveled to the Carrier Dome (I refuse to call it by its new name) to take on Syracuse. In a rematch of the 2022 NCAA Quarterfinals the Orange knocked off NU 16-15. In her first game back from a torn ACL Izzy Scane scored five goals and Maddy Taylor added five scores in her first college game. Notably missing from this game was grad transfer Hailey Rhatigan who would finish second in goals for the Wildcats. By the time NU takes the field to start the 2024 season it will have been 364 days since it was defeated. What many consider to be the best day in 2023. There’s no way to capture the moment in writing so everyone just think back to it. For me it started lining up outside the arena over two hours before tip-off with my friends. After we got in and secured our front-row spots I watched as hoards of students filed in decked out in black. To be frank the first 36 minutes of the game are a blur; however the last four minutes are etched in my memory. It all started with a Buie offensive rebound swinging it out to Audige for a corner three — five-point game. Then mere seconds later as Dave Revsine put it “Audige the steal Audige the slam” — three-point game. A couple of Boilermakers’ turnovers later and the ‘Cats had the ball with 90 seconds left. Audige dribbled to the rim and passed it over to Barnhizer before running the baseline to the corner... swish ‘Cats lead. As he backpedaled high-stepping his way down the court you could not hear yourself think inside a raucous Welsh-Ryan Arena. Flash forward 90 seconds later and the court was a sea of black when students flooded onto the floor to celebrate Northwestern’s first-ever win over an AP No. 1 ranked team. “The improbable season has taken an impossible turn.” The best week in Northwestern history continued on Wednesday night when the ‘Cats squared off against the No. 14 Indiana Hoosiers. After taking a commanding 20-point lead into the halftime locker room it looked like NU was going to cruise to victory. Yet the Hoosiers did not go quietly into the night pulling back even with roughly 30 seconds left in the game. To everyone who had watched Northwestern basketball over the past years you could feel the tension in the air. This was going to be another comeback heartbreaking loss that fans had seen so many times. Enter Boo Buie. With six seconds to go Agent Zero drove downhill dropping his shoulder into a defender to create separation and dropping in a floater with 2.7 seconds left on the clock sending the ‘Cats faithful into a frenzy. As Indiana’s last-ditch half-court shot clanged off the rim the crowd erupted as Buie was surrounded by the bench in celebration. ""I dont know if this needs to be on here but it is so preposterous that I had to include it."" ""Shes incredible."" People always forget that Northwestern is a beach school. As students filled the baselines in Hawaiian shirts or if you are me in a scuba mask with floaties this game was a party. The ‘Cats dominated for all 40 minutes of the game sailing to a 20-point win. To make it even better Fran McCaffery went FranCon 1 on the referees and was subsequently ejected leading to a hilarious “where’s your daddy” chant from the student section toward McCaffery’s sons. The creativity didn’t stop there because when Patrick McCaffery picked up a technical foul the crowd serenaded him with a “just like daddy” chant. When the clock struck zero the Wildcats took home the victory punching their ticket to the dance. There were signs of problems inside Jim Foster’s squad pretty much from the moment the season began. Northwestern started the season 0-6 looking noncompetitive. As if the play on the field wasn’t bad enough it was reported that all of NU’s assistant coaches stepped away from the program. Pitching coach Jon Strauss hitting coach Dusty Napoleon and operations director Chris Beacom all left the program just two weekends into the season leaving just Foster and a volunteer coach.  The three would later file a lawsuit against Northwestern saying it allowed Foster to create an “abusive toxic and dangerous environment.” I know it’s not a game but this was a historic day for Northwestern basketball. For the second time in program history the Wildcats were headed to the NCAA Tournament. In a season where many thought Chris Collins would be shown the door at the end of it he led the ‘Cats to the most Big Ten wins in school history and had them dancing. As the purple N popped across the jumbotron hugs and celebration rang out while the fight song blared in the background. Collins and Co. had to put up or shut up and they sure did put up. It was a wild night in Northwestern Athletics. Roughly half an hour before the NFL Draft started Rittenberg reported that Northwestern came to an agreement with Chris Collins on a contract extension. Collins added three more years onto his contract keeping him in Evanston until 2028. To make the night even better for those in purple Peter Skoronski was selected 11th overall by the Tennessee Titans. Skoronski was the second offensive lineman from Northwestern to be taken in the first round in the last three years joining Rashawn Slater. He is the highest-selected Wildcat since 1983. Nothing else to say here except it was pure domination from the Lakeshow. Every member of the Wildcats’ five-headed monster got in on the scoring and Molly Laliberty did enough in net to hand the ‘Cats a 14-9 victory and the hardware. He was back. Buie who had originally entered his name into the NBA Draft announced he was withdrawing his name and returning to Northwestern for a fifth season. He had earned first-team All-Big Ten honors in 2023 and was named a preseason All-American for 2024. So far he is on track to reach both of those accomplishments after this season. This may be my favorite moment of the year. They don’t call them the Cardiac ‘Cats for nothing. After a controversial call gifted the Hoosiers a 1-0 lead Northwestern entered the bottom of the seventh staggering on offense. However it was hard to keep the bats down forever. Jordyn Rudd started the inning off with a single and Hannah Cady followed that up with a double. Nikki Cochran worked a walk and the ball four-pitch rolled to the backstop allowing Lauren Sciborski pinch-running for Rudd to score and even the game. Two batters later Maeve Nelson sent a towering fly ball off the wall bringing in Cady for the winning run and the ‘Cats the Big Ten title for the first time since 2008. Imagine winning by so much in a National Championship that it reached a running clock. Well the ‘Cats did just that. Starting off the Final Four Northwestern took on Denver and its vaunted defense. However the top defense in the nation was no match for the Wildcats with NU racking up 15 goals. Scane on her way to the Tewaaraton found the net six times in the game. ""In the National Championship Northwestern’s powerhouse offense was on full display. The Wildcats scored 18 goals against the No. 2 team in the nation. Scane added four goals to her weekend total and Maddy Taylor tacked on four scores as well. As the clock struck zero Rhatigan put the exclamation point with one final goal and the sideline rushed the field to celebrate the programs eighth national title."" The month of June was quiet for NU Athletics but July made up for it easily. Let me paint the scene for you all. It is a regular Friday morning. I am working my job as a camp counselor trying to corral a group of five-year-olds to go fishing. After I finally get the kids seated I get a notification across my phone from Northwestern. In the email is the executive summary of the investigation which stated that hazing had occurred the announcement that Fitz had been suspended for two weeks — plus statements from Fitz Dr. Gragg and President Schill. First I had to hold in an expletive so I didn’t get fired but then I kicked into overdrive. However there was one small problem: I was the only one awake. After making a couple of frantic phone calls to Bradley and Iggy both to no avail I decided to write the hit while dealing with the kids. The hit you all read was written by me on my phone because I didn’t think I needed my computer on the docks. By the time the hit was written and published everyone woke up and it only got crazier. This is when the s**t really hit the fan. Allegations of sexual hazing were made and the public learned about the practice of “running” the “car wash” and the Shrek list. When this came out it sure felt like Fitz’s two-week suspension — during an NCAA dead period — didn’t match the accusations. If this story never came out Fitzgerald likely would have returned to the program on Media Day and fielded a couple of questions about it and the whole thing may have blown over; instead the story forced Schill to reverse course. Following the article’s release mid-day a letter was circulated from the “entire” Northwestern football team saying the allegations were made up and they all supported Pat Fitzgerald. However there were no signatures from the players on the team so doubts arose about if the entire team signed this thing. While not a big factor in the grand scheme of the scandal just another strange part. I apologize to my employer for this day.  Roughly around noon Bradley spoke with a former Northwestern football player who confirmed the nature of the hazing inside the program. Furthermore Iggy spoke with a former player who alleged that he experienced racism inside the program. At the same time The Daily Northwestern received allegations of racism inside NUFB from multiple sources. As if to make this day even more crazy 670 The Score broke the floodgates open on Northwestern baseball and Jim Foster. It was here that we first learned of the toxic culture created by Foster that led to nearly half the players transferring. In the report Foster was accused of making racist comments sexually harassing a female staffer and forcing injured players to not see the trainer. Just another day for Northwestern Athletics and another thing to add to the dumpster fire of July. The move that everyone saw coming yet no one expected it. I was on a radio show at 3 p.m. saying I didn’t think Northwestern would fire Fitz because he was the face of the university; however by 6 p.m. I was wrong. With the number of allegations growing Schill decided to cut ties with Fitzgerald ending his 17-year run at the helm of the program. The man who helped the ‘Cats rise to prominence leading them to 10 bowl games left the program unceremoniously. As if the school was not already going through enough s**t players tweeted out that Gragg addressed the team via Zoom because he was on vacation in Europe leading to calls for Gragg to be canned as well.  As if our lives could not get any crazier we had been working on an expose of Jim Foster. The night of Fitz’s dismissal it was all hands on deck for Inside NU. Bradley Ethan and I handled the aftermath of the firing getting stuff written for the next day. Meanwhile Gavin Dorsey Iggy and Sophia Vlahakis combed through hours of interviews to put the story together. I ended up joining them once my column was written listening to interviews to ensure we had everything 100% correct. All night we combed through the story going line by line to fact-check everything. I think as an executive board the total number of hours slept that night was under two. We eventually got it up early Tuesday morning but I ended up being like an hour late to work. So once again apologies to my employer. This was a decision that surprised nobody. With the transfer portal closing at midnight Gragg called a meeting with the entire baseball team informing them that Foster would not return as head coach after just one season. To quote a member of the baseball program: “Happiest day of my life.” The moment that changed Northwestern football history. Braun took over the program after spending six months as the defensive coordinator. He had never been a head coach and had never even coached a snap at the FBS level. Yet we all know the magic that happened next. Ok time for an inside baseball story. Bradley and I had been working on this story for over a week and were just waiting for final confirmation on some of the details of the story; however we were beaten to the punch by a lawsuit. When the suit dropped I was at work sitting in the dunk tank as the kids missed again and again (yes I was taunting them). During my lunch break I checked my phone to see the press release from the law firm and I had to bite my tongue to avoid cursing. What happened next is out of a comedy movie because my esteemed colleague Bradley was fast asleep. Let me mention it was already noon. First phone call nothing. The second phone call nothing. The third phone call nothing. By this point I left Brad the most expletive-laced voicemail of my life (I moved away from the children) and by the time he woke up Iggy and I decided the story had to go up that day. In our reporting Bradley and I learned that Shane Davis was suspended in March 2021 for his involvement in hazing a player on the team and that suspension was not announced to the public at the time. Furthermore we learned Davis had to sign a document admitting his role in the hazing.  Just another day for Northwestern. If you wonder what the travel experience from hell would look like I have a story for you. Anyway this was the first time we heard from any member of Northwestern since the hazing scandal uprooted the program. Braun in his first appearance as head coach took questions for over an hour and passed that test with flying colors — which should have been a sign for the future. Not only did Braun speak to the media but so did Gragg who sat down with Revsine and Rittenberg. I asked the first question to the Big Ten commissioner even though Brad strongly opposed. All in all it was an experience I’ll never forget. Good old Michael Schill. This was just bizarre. Bradley and I were driving back to Chicago from Indianapolis when The Daily’s article with Northwestern’s president dropped. In the interview Schill told The Daily that Foster was not fired but he was placed on “indefinite suspension.” I’m sorry... what? It didn’t mean much because Schill said Foster would never coach again at NU; however it was just another strange moment in a summer full of them. Why? Just why? On the only day of fall camp open to the media numerous members of Northwestern’s coaching staff donned shirts with the words ‘Cats against the world with Pat Fitzgerald’s No. 51 on it. The shirts went viral on Twitter drawing condemnation from across the sports world. In fact Dr. Gragg released a statement later that day calling the shirts “inappropriate offensive and tone deaf.” At the start of the season assistant coaches were supposed to be available to the media during the weeks of the season and more fall camp practices were supported to be open to the media. After this incident that quickly changed. It took nearly 700 days but Northwestern finally won a football game on American soil thrashing UTEP 38-7. The Miners were favored for most of the week and the books looked correct when the teams went to the half tied at 7-7. In the second half a dominant ground game secured the win for the Wildcats and the streak was over. I don’t know how many teams overcame a 21-point deficit in the fourth quarter to win the game but I do know Northwestern was one of them. The emotions of this game from the world was ending to pure jubilation reminded me why I love sports. Ben Bryant etched his name into Northwestern lore that night throwing for nearly 400 yards and four touchdowns the first time a Wildcat QB has thrown four TDs since 2013. Also Bryce Kirtz’s 215 yards were pretty good. From the world’s largest truck stop and beyond the lore of this trip will live on forever. Shoutout Iggy. Olivia Bent-Cole’s double-overtime winner was the lone goal of the game giving the ‘Cats the title. It was a rock fight between two of the best teams in the nation and Northwestern displayed why it should have been the No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament before it got gypped by the selection committee. #Tagremoved. It was the easiest decision Gragg ever had to make. Braun had just led NU to a 24-7 stomping of Wisconsin on the road the first time the ‘Cats had won in Madison since 2015. At this point the ‘Cats were 5-5 a spot everyone thought was impossible when Braun took over in July. Yet they were in that position in large part because of their head coach so the interim tag came off and David Braun was here to stay. No one saw this coming. After demolishing Wisconsin in Camp Randall Northwestern returned for one last game in Ryan Field. Although it was not pretty Xander Mueller sealed a 23-15 win over Purdue with an interception bringing the Wildcats to that magical number of six wins. Fans stormed the field to celebrate the win surrounding their new head coach and chanting his name as he tried to do his postgame interview.  As Braun put it in his post-game presser “it’s pretty cool.” This was one of the best games I’ve ever watched. Annabelle Skubisz was lights out in net including a crazy penalty shot save to keep the Wildcats alive in overtime. As if two overtimes weren’t enough a round of shootout could not decide a winner. It turned to sudden-death shootout and North Carolina brought home the trophy. While the game did not fall NU’s way it was an incredible season by Tracey Fuchs and Co. This game was drunk. Davis’ eight-year tenure at the helm of the program concluded at the end of the 2023 season with the ‘Cats finishing 15-15 and 9-11 in conference play. In his near-decade at NU Davis failed to take the Wildcats to the NCAA Tournament and never had a winning Big Ten record. Add in allegations of hazing and misconduct and Gragg made the decision it was best to take the program in a new direction. Not often can you beat the No. 1 team in the nation twice in one year but the Wildcats did. On the back of Buie’s 31-point performance NU held on for a 92-88 overtime victory. Ty Berry and Ryan Langborg both were lights out from beyond the arc and the ‘Cats did just enough to overcome Zach Edey’s 35-point double-double including the 14 fouls he drew against the ‘Cats’ big men.  For the second time in the calendar year fans rushed onto the court to celebrate the victory. It was the third time Northwestern had stormed a playing surface against Purdue that year. Gregg Doyel is seething somewhere. In the Sin City Bryant became a Northwestern legend in front of our eyes leading a game-winning drive just minutes after being knocked out of the game with an injury. A beautiful pass in the corner of the end zone to Kirtz gave NU a 14-7 lead. The ‘Cats’ defense balled out all game forcing three turnovers and sealed the win with a stop. To close out his first season Braun was met by a Gatorade bath and a bowl trophy. I’ll admit it: that team proved me wrong. All in all it was a crazy year.

Share this story There’s something about Casey Harter and exclamation points. With under nine minutes to play in the fourth quarter Northwestern found itself down 62-58. It had already erased a double-digit deficit in the second quarter only for Rutgers to open up an eight-point edge late in the third. When Jillian Huerter got baseline position on Harter on a dribble drive from the right wing it seemed like the Scarlet Knights would quell NU’s momentum yet again. Instead the first-year guard reached over to block Huerter’s layup snagged the rebound and took it 94 feet the other way for a coast-to-coast score. This wasn’t the first run-punctuating play for Harter. Against Maryland three weeks ago she tied the game at 27 in the second quarter with a step-back three after Northwestern found itself down by nine just three minutes earlier. However the mark that shot left on the game wasn’t permanent because NU followed its game-tying run with a third quarter in which it got outscored 20-6 and made fewer field goals than turnovers. Whether they’ve come at the beginning of games or in the third quarter gigantic opposing runs like those have plagued the ‘Cats all year. It seemed like the Rutgers game would follow a similar blueprint when the Scarlet Knights maintained control after Northwestern’s second-quarter run. Harter’s play led to three things that proved the opposite: The Wildcats didn’t just bring themselves back into the game with their 12-0 fourth quarter run. They also seized control and the game-changing plays came from every starter. That dominant stretch proved their second-quarter response wasn’t just a flash in the pan but a hint of something greater coming up. And that begs the question: was that fourth quarter also a sign of things to come? It may be. Northwestern played as balanced of a game against Rutgers as it has against any Power Six opponent this season. The Scarlet Knights couldn’t stop Caileigh Walsh who dropped 22 points (16 of which came in the first half) stayed out of foul trouble in the first 20 minutes and stretched the defense at all three levels. When she cooled off Northwestern shifted seamlessly to running its offense through Daley and her midrange prowess.  As the third option Paige Mott continued a hyper-efficient four-game stretch by going 7-of-9 from the field and taking attention off Walsh. Even the two starters who didn’t shoot well Harter and Caroline Lau made their presences felt by combining for 15 of NU’s 24 assists and 12 of the Wildcats’ 29 rebounds. Northwestern didn’t shoot a three-pointer in the fourth quarter. Although that’s a little strange for a fast-paced team like NU the greater takeaway from that is that the Wildcats found immense success working their way inside. Whether those points came in transition off turnovers or post entry passes to Mott Northwestern earned higher-quality looks. It’s why the ‘Cats shot 7-of-11 from the field in the final period and it might just be a recipe for success going forward if they can win the turnover battle which they did on Saturday. This win did come against a Rutgers team that for some reason played Kaylene Smikle for just five minutes in the second quarter. Shooting as well as NU did from the field in the fourth quarter is also a lot to ask. However if it can continue playing that type of balanced basketball with multiple runs in their favor against Big Ten competition it can build on this. It flashed this resilience against Temple and put it on full display at Welsh-Ryan Arena. Northwestern’s next test is a road matchup against a Penn State team that took No. 17 Ohio State to overtime in November and lost to No. 6 USC by just one point. A win against a team that leads the nation with a 42.1% three-point percentage is going to be incredibly difficult. If the ‘Cats can do that though a ship that appeared to be sinking a few weeks ago will be afloat and cruising. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Share this story In the next iteration of our position-by-position evaluations from Northwestern football’s 2023 season we’ll take a deeper dive into the Wildcats’ offensive line — which is now mired in uncertainty after the departure of Josh Priebe and with OL coach Kurt Anderson’s future unknown. Overall Grade: C- Admittedly without consensus All-American Peter Skoronski and more regular starters in Charlie Schmidt and Ethan Wiederkehr a lower level of play was to be expected from Northwestern’s offensive line in 2023. In many ways however the unit failed to even meet its relative goals. For at least the third straight year the Wildcats’ OL was generally a liability if not one of the weaker units on the team — failing to jell frequently nullifying positive gains and overarchingly demonstrating a lack of consistency. On the season the Wildcats’ starting five allowed 27 sacks and 154 pressures; both of those figures were the worst in the Big Ten by a considerable margin. Collectively the team’s Pro Football Focus pass-blocking grade was 102nd out of 133 FBS teams. There were multiple games (e.g. vs. Penn State at Nebraska etc.) where the Wildcats’ offensive line was simply overmatched and didn’t give whoever was under center a fighting chance in the pocket. Additionally NU ranked 87th in run-blocking grade with lanes largely not available for whoever was toting the rock. However some growth did manifest itself as the year progressed. NU’s trench ‘Cats permitted fewer than 10 pressures in the team’s final four regular-season games. Additionally Northwestern had two of its highest rushing totals against Wisconsin and Illinois something which underscores that more solidified work was done up front in the latter portions of 2023. Player Grades Caleb Tiernan: C+ In the early parts of the year Tiernan appeared trending in the wrong direction as he switched from right to left tackle. The junior never earned higher than a 63 PFF grade in each of Northwestern’s first five games. His stats in that span: 15 pressures and one sack allowed. However the 6-foot-7 tackle seemed to make strides as the season endured yielding no further sacks and only 11 additional pressures in the next seven games. Likewise Tiernan’s pass-blocking prowess began to show at Illinois and at Wisconsin when he posted grades above 82 in that category per PFF. At the same time penalties were a major flaw with Tiernan — his six were the second-most on Northwestern. As he enters his fourth season in Evanston and third as a starter Tiernan will need to hone in on those types of lapses and his hand placement. If he does so he has the intangibles and experience to become an above-average starter in the conference and a cornerstone for David Braun’s second offensive line. Josh Priebe: B- Priebe allowed only 17 pressures all year which was the fewest among any NU starting offensive lineman. Consequently he garnered Third Team All-Big Ten honors. At the same time Priebe posted just a 62 overall grade. The big problem? He gave up four sacks on those 17 pressures plus racked up four penalties. Although it was gratifying to be able to see Priebe play all 12 games after consecutive seasons of year-ending injuries his play didn’t totally meet expectations in 2023. Now off to Michigan Priebe will look to work under Sherrone Moore who has helped craft consecutive Joe Moore Award-winning units and a slew of NFL talent. Ben Wrather: D Wrather’s 46.7 PFF grade was not only the worst among NU’s starting five but also the lowest among all Power Five centers to play 500 or more snaps. Point blank he had a much maligned season. The largest qualm for Wrather were penalties of which he accrued seven. On top of that he was often overmatched in contests that featured premier interior defensive linemen including Johnny Newton at Illinois and against Penn State a game in which he gave up a whopping seven pressures. For all of the season Wrather never earned higher than a 59.3 single-game PFF grade. If he does elect to return for another season there will be considerable things to ameliorate if he wants to remain Northwestern’s man in the middle. Dom D’Antonio: C D’Antonio permitted both the most sacks (five) and pressures (27) on the ‘Cats but he remained spotless in the penalty department — something that was often refreshing after a litany of mental mistakes. Another asset was durability as his 855 snaps played was tops on the purple and white. Like Wrather D’Antonio will have the ability to return for another season; if he does he’d figure to slot right back in as Northwestern’s starting RG. Otherwise the Wildcats will have to fill his void either by elevating a budding young O-lineman or by snagging someone from the transfer portal. Josh Thompson: C+ Thompson made a strong early impression when he came in relief against UTEP allowing zero pressures on 27 snaps in Northwestern’s win. However he struggled shortly thereafter by allowing nine pressures and two sacks in NU’s games against Minnesota and Penn State. By the end of the season though Thompson appeared more comfortable as the team’s primary right tackle. He never gave up a sack beyond Week Five and he relented just four pressures in NU’s final four contests. It’s not a coincidence that his three highest-graded performances of the year came in Weeks 11-13. At 6-foot-5 the junior appears to form a solid tandem with Tiernan (coincidentally a fellow Michigan resident) on the perimeter for Northwestern’s 2024 offensive line. Thompson will have to work on consistency and opposing higher-level rushers but his talent is evident as he ventures into his senior season. Zach Franks: D- Franks allowed a staggering seven pressures and four sacks in only 64 opportunities to begin the 2023 campaign against the Scarlet Knights and Miners. To be candid he was a major reason for Northwestern’s early offensive struggles because Ben Bryant dealt with pressure off his right side on nearly a snap-by-snap basis. As a result Braun benched Franks and turned to Thompson — something which proved fruitful. The senior played only 27 snaps the rest of the way but he was pivotal in Allegiant Stadium after an injury to Jordan Knox forced Thompson to move to left guard. Franks surrendered only one pressure down the stretch something which enabled the Wildcats to take the lead on an eventual game-winning possession in their postseason matchup with Utah. Jordan Knox: Incomplete Knox’s first and only start was generally an effective one: before his injury he posted an 82.7 pass-blocking grade against Utah in the Las Vegas Bowl. Yet his run blocking (56.0 grade) was not at the same caliber. Generally Knox saw time on 132 snaps in eight games primarily as a lead blocker/fullback (even wearing No. 93) or a sixth offensive lineman on jumbo packages. Expect the incoming sophomore to headline the competition for one of NU’s starting guard spots as next season approaches. Jackson Carsello: Incomplete Carsello got the start in Lincoln following Northwestern’s bye and played the entire game but the Cornhuskers proved a struggle. The junior had a 41.7 PFF grade and gave up two sacks in lieu of Wrather who returned to the starting lineup the following week. All told Carsello played 99 snaps in 2023 which is hardly a sufficient sample size for full evaluation. It wouldn’t be surprising to see him take over for Wrather in 2024. \n    More From\n    \n        Inside NU\n],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
